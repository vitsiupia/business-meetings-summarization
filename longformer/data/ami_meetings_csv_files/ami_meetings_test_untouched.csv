"Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay.. Ok okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. So do you know uh which way you give the feedback? Light or I saw something like that. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Maybe more complex, yeah. Yeah. So th Hmm. But yeah. To the border basically some distance? Or Okay. O okay. Obviously, yeah. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Right. Hmm. Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. But don't yeah. Don't you think with a beam also you have less problems with the sheets? Or you don't want to do that. Yeah. Okay. Confusing, yeah. Hmm. Okay. No, it's a choice. Yeah.. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yep. Okay. Yeah. But physically it's just uh something flat on the table again, yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Yeah, so it's different, but still uh yeah, it's same Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Hmm. Right. Hmm. Okay. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Or too long. Oh, just kidding. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Ah, so you ha you you might have multiple colours? Or yeah. Sorry, didn't get that. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Okay. Yeah.. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Hmm. No, it's quite clear. So uh I guess you want to know what you could do with an array maybe? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Or yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's good idea. Just give some questions uh Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You mean the top of the wave-form? Okay. Yeah. Oh Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Separation uh Yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Well you need a camera. Obviously. I mean will you have a camera? Maybe you can detect breathing. Yeah. Yeah, that you could do. Or on the table uh there should be well. Okay uh Okay. Mm. Well Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. So you I think Guillaume said that's optic, something like that? Or Okay. So you you need a different you need a microphone with um a device inside, right? Ho how does it work? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Mm. Hmm. It's another fire-wire or not fire-wire, but um Okay. But concretely you would use that to get higher quality signals? Y that's all.. Yeah. Ah okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Okay. And how Hmm. Hmm. You mean you meant eight kilo uh sampling frequency? Yeah. Uh we use sixteen. So that's eight kilo band-width. Sixteen kilo uh sampling frequency. It it's not bad. Uh it's quite decent. Um Mm f before answering the questions uh th there's also a point of uh precision of localization if you use an array. So if you use higher frequencies you can get more precise localization. But maybe you don't need it. Uh that I can't answer directly. Uh it depends on your set-up, you know. Um you have to test basically. Um Y you get uh the angle. The most precise one is the asymmet in the horizontal plane. Then you also get elevation. But it's not very precise. It's more of an indication. And radius is very bad. If you use a planar geometry like this one. Yeah. Um you can use multiple ones and do some um um triangulation. Eight, eight. These are only screws. Microphones are on bottom. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. A cube? Okay. Yeah, then you might get uh better direction in elevation. But I'm not sure it's really relevant. Um no. So Uh if people move forward, yeah. Ah, the radius? Th then the r the problem is not the geometry, it's the um I you need more than one basically. With one you will only get direction. Microphone array. So Mm. Direction, yeah. Um Yeah. It's a different option, yeah. Um we haven't tried that because we are not going to have the special kind of table. More uh this is not a good example but we have like a box, just bring the box and put it. So it uh we could not consider that. But in your case it could be interesting, yeah. Unless people put something on the microphone. But um Yeah. Right. But that I'm I think after the meeting we can go and talk to Olivier about that. I'm not the person for hardware. Yeah. Yeah, I'll t I'll try to present uh I guess it corresponds to your questions. Yeah. So the the lowest layer would be the first two questions. Um you asked about how to detect um activity. Currently you're thresholding the t maximum of your wave-form, right. Ah, ah. Okay. And you're looking for a peak. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Okay. Uh Yeah. Yeah. And your second question uh was about F_F_T_, what can be done with F_F_T_. So um the approach we're taking here is to answer both questions the same time. We use F_F_T_ to do detection. We don't use the wave-form, the raw wave-form. So um We split um we split the signal in small frames, like sixteen millisecond. Sixteen. Um each frame is taking thirty two millisecond of signal, just to give an idea. And there is a one frame every sixteen millisecond, and they overlap of fifty percent. Um Yeah. Each sixteen millisecond. Well th these are details. It's just to give an idea. Um Well it's uh the the c Because usually when you do F_F_T_, y if I'm getting into details, but you you apply um a window to avoid effect. So the beginning and the end it it i it's not crappy, it's just not very much rep represented because you apply um a window which has this shape, having window. So they're very yeah. No, I'm saying uh when you take your signal you take one frame, you apply the window, uh and the window is simply uh coefficients you give. And you give higher coefficient to the middle than to the extreme. So if you don't do overlap y you will lose information at the beginning and the end. Okay. But you don't have to do overlap. I mean uh it's um Hmm. Um C_M_U_, no? Is it from C_M_U_? Um uh yeah. Yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. F_F_T_ is only a tool. Uh um uh what we do release a phase domain analysis. We only use the phase between the microphones. Um Yeah, but also for detection. Yeah. Um we have a way so um I don't think I should get into details. But basically the beginning is your signal which you slice into frame. You do F_F_T_ on each mic. And the end is um a number of uh frequency beams which are used by each person, to uh explain roughly. S so when you speak, speech is wide band. So um the more active you are the more band-width you use. So you will get a large value of band-width for people who speak. And uh for the others it will random. It will be a small value. Or just background noise. And so uh Yeah. 'Cause one problem if you use energy based methods, which is probably more uh the thing you've been using so far, is that it's not um quite related to location. So you can have um uh for one person you can have uh a high energy signal which is difficult to locate, and visa versa. Um I think in your case you're quite interested in the location. So I would advise to um use more uh phase domain methods. Um Once you have the fifty, for each frequency you have uh the magnitude and the phase. So you can compare the phase of the microphones. And this is directly linked to the direction of the person. Um Sometimes we use it, but not it's not the first thing we use. I know it's a bit counterintuitive. But um maybe I'll go t to the board. Yeah. Okay. R right, for a single channel it's not very meaningful. But here it's relative phase between the microphones. So uh I'll just try to um s summarise. No, that's what I don't do. Um this would be valid for uh like speech recognition with a single channel. That would be a very good idea. But if you choose to use multiple channels um let's say you have four of them, with F_F_T_ you can just uh, as I said, l look at the phase between the microphones at a given frequency. Um it is linked to this value, yeah. Uh basically the time you're mentioning is this value. And this is the frequency. And this is an angle in radians. So uh F_F_T_ gives you a measure of these values. Uh this, I can point to a paper, uh I don't think this is the right place to explain everything. But will give you if you look at your table, uh what we have developed here is an approach where um th uh you divide the space in sectors. For example ten sectors around the table. And uh in each sector you will get the value. No. It's uh application dependent. For example um Well this is not. And on this one you could have a large value. On on on those ones, small values. Uh these are number frequencies which we estimate with several steps from these measures. So to conclude what we are doing is uh we estimate how much of the frequency spectrum you are occupying when you speak, or I am occupying in this direction when I speak. And it turns out that um this is quite good to do uh detection and localization at the same time. Bec because you know in a sector space there is uh uh this much activity. Yeah, yeah. Um more recently um I've worked on uh um prolongating this with a more precise direction evaluation to know where in the sector the person is. So that uh that's not much work. Once you have done this, this is can be this can be done quite quickly. Then you Yeah, y well I I use a value. But then you'll get two large values. Yeah. So No. Just direction. Yeah. Well, f yeah, I it's not uh i it's an inherent problem to the geometry you use. You can for example, if you use another array, uh you can intersect lines of direction. Uh Mm maybe. Uh uh I w mm I wouldn't trust it too much. Classically, what you do is you extract the signal of the person. Um one interesting thing is that these numbers are not uh arbitrary things. They represent the number frequencies where a given person is dominant. But when you have two of them, which might be interesting for separation, you know already when you have done this processing uh w which part of the frequencies of the spectrum um belongs to this person and to that person. And then it's easy to separate the signals. Um both. It's it's more an instantaneous um this is still instantaneous. This is for one time frame. If you look at all your frequencies for example uh zero to four kilohertz, um you can split it and say uh all these parts belong to person one here. And uh all the other parts belong to the other person. That's correct. But then uh you can look statistically it wi it will be negligible um because the r of uh of the difference level. Yeah. It's uh you can listen to it, yeah. And then you can do some uh maybe higher level um analysis where you get the pitch of the person or This Yeah, yeah. And this is Exactly. Yeah. Then it's uh random. And that's why you get these values uh which are random. Yeah. Yeah, but this is very rare. And when it happens, one is always masking the other in practice. So um Yeah. No no. But uh I've I've seen quite a few papers I I've n not done it myself. I'm really on the lowest level. Um but uh once you have done this, as I said, you can uh separate the signals and um do do processing. Uh so uh you can get pitch, rate of speech. That's quite easy. Pitch um the uh uh timbre en Francais. Um so uh for different person this might be quite different. At least for male females. And uh rate of speech. Like if somebody is talking very uh in a very energetic manner, it might be quite fast. Uh or just energy also. One Yeah, also. Um that might be an issue with people are bringing laptops. Um They will b yeah. They might be detected as another another source. Uh so you would have to uh classify the sources as human or machine. But again, yeah, I think once you see the spectrum, if it's just pure and stable uh Also yeah, if if there's no pitch. So uh Yeah. Yeah. So all will go and be detected there. Yeah. So w what you're mentioning is a pain for us. But for you it might be 'cause we're only interesting in getting the speech. But for you it might be quite uh quite good, yeah. So I've to avoid uh filtering and smoothing. 'Cause as soon as you do that um you exclude some of the information. So it's better to keep it for the latest stage. So um um on top of this there's another part uh which is more linked to the tracking. All this was for one time frame. So um Yeah, you can play with it. Um in speech it's uh stationary over ten, twenty millisecond. And we make a stationary assumption, a local stationary T_ assumption um which allows you to use F_F_T_ and blah, blah, blah. Uh now in spite of that I know some people use much longer windows, which is not a problem. But Uh it's a bit too much I think. Uh like some very small words, like yes, they might be two hundred millisecond or three hundred millisecond. Um Yeah, they might be blurred with uh silence. So yes. You you might have to play with it just to save processing time, like use slightly longer frames. Yeah, at m at most, yeah. Um Simply because I've used one hundred as a minimum length of a speech word. Yeah, so. Um now assuming you have done this for each time, i if this is your detail or I should use a different Um if this is your asymmet at each time you get a direction. So asymmet is your direction in horizontal plane. It's an angle. Like north, south, east, west. And Yeah. No no, of this is uh really different. I'm just saying that uh once you have done this for a given time frame you can have a direction of the person, at least in terms of sector. And it's also possible to give a more precise direction quite quickly. So uh this was kind of the lowest layer. Now this is a layer just above it which might interest you. Um if you repeat that over time you will see patterns um for example uh at two different locations. Two different person will speak. So you can cluster those. And you will see that uh if it's long enough it's some significant event. Um this can be done quite cheaply, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A cost. Yeah, th Um well I use Matlab. So it's not perfect. It's like three, four Yeah. But not everything is uh um simple linear. Especially this part. It's definitely not linear because you're looking at a maximum energy in a frequency, kind of. The most expensive part is here. With Matlab I have three, four times real time. Um you can do sub-optimal processing and uh for example here I'm considering all possible pairs of microphones, uh which is twenty eight, and the processing is directly um r proportional to that. So um you can save on that. But then you lose a little bit on precision. Also I I'm using all the small frames with fifty percent overlap. I don't think you really need absolutely to do that. It's not that good in terms of uh direction. Um Yeah, I would be careful with that. Like five, six is uh decent. Uh six I would say, yeah. Eight, yeah, uh I get down now to one, two degrees uh root mean square error. Uh so you might not need that. That's what I mean. Might not be Um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it could be sufficient to uh, yeah, define enough sectors and No. No. So it's arbitrary. I use twenty degree sectors. Uh 'cause I had to choose a value. But it's up to you. Um Yeah. Yeah. Um So that's another way, yeah. It it's almost like having a lapel, yeah. Um Yeah. I think it's not necessarily a bad idea, actually. Um Well uh If you are able to calibrate your microphones um the ones who are closer to the person will get more energy. Um so you can compare that. It's possible. So Yeah. Um I have experience with that. Um on the side I've done some single channel work which can maybe help. Um 'cause uh it seems to me that you are not definite on the geometry, right? Yeah. Um m this part is quite specific to a microphone array where like they are concentrated in uh some place, like in the middle of the table. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you can kind of come back to that also. Um Uh F_F_T_ also. Yeah, yeah. R right. Yeah, yeah. It has to be as good as possible. Yeah. Yeah. True. Yeah. We can also consider directional microphones. You know no. Um so you can uh their pattern is uh not uh the same uh depending on the direction where the person is. So for example if there was a directional microphone pointing there you would get most of my energy but less from you, et cetera. You can also do microphone arrays with directional microphones. Uh um might not be relevant. But um Uh More or less. It's it depends on what you want. I mean uh I don't know. Yeah. They're o yeah, omni-directional, yeah. M uh I guess so. It's the same, yeah. Exactly the same, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Quite expensive. Yeah, they are um high quality mics. Uh I think we can leave this question for Olivier. Yeah. No, no. Y you would uh assume Uh you would neglect it. The time delay is is very small. It it's only used for uh getting the a direction when you have a microphone array. But in that case it's not relevant. Um you would assume that they are roughly synchronised, not necessarily very precisely, and um compare the energy levels. But I have no experience with that. Um Now I don't know, you don't want to use ah, it's almost okay. Yes.
No. I don't uh Well I guess it's just a restriction we took. So so we don't uh the m amount of money we have to spend. Otherwise we could have uh we could imagine to have a whole table of of uh s well, of L_E_D_s. And then y you can really start to to some regions of the table. So yeah. Oh let's. Does Yeah, I can just explain my project. It's completely different from this one. Well, it's also about tables, but the idea is if uh uh the several students come to a table with their laptops, they should be able to to share information easily. And uh in fact w what we we are doing now, we project um another screen on on the table, and different people are are are able to use their their mouse of their laptop to go to the to the project screen there and uh the project screen is just another Windows machine that is running. So you just have another f computer more or less you can use, but you can use it with your your own mouse and keyboard. Exactly. But uh in contrary to to having al another keyboard and mouse that only one person can use, now the different persons can use the the screen um at the same time with the with the mouse. I'll s still the same subjects. It's it's collaborative work. But uh It has nothing to do with uh audio processing and uh L_E_D_. So Anyway, uh I think the the details of the implementation is not that important. It's more important that first we want to to have some events like two people are talking or one one started and another started and uh well, more or less broke into the speech of the first person, and so on. And then you can start to visualise these uh different situations. Well that's uh I guess it's first prototype i you see we start with uh people two people talk or and don't and don't they. Uh afterwards uh one could imagine that you for example you can detect that someone is a bit angry or is uh yelling. And wi with different colours with uh with different colours on on table you could uh display this this uh give some feedback. But uh Yep. That's uh Once we get the hardware. Mm. Yes. Everything from um multi switch administration of uh audio and how you can uh analyse it, uh what information you can get out of speech and so on. So Probably it's uh it's f be a good idea if you have s two uh with um with source like uh books or web page centre. Give a lot of information how it is audio programming and so on works, cetera. Maybe you you know some at least a good book that's uh dealing with this stuff. Mm-hmm. And is possible to do this in real time. That's uh No. Yeah, but what happens if o someone is standing then? Yeah. No, no, no. In fact uh that's uh it's another thing, this optic. Well uh m we have Ye Actually, it's not really an extension to the first box, just an indu industry standard uh uh protocol between these two uh Well well there's a special protocol to to deliver uh audio signals and uh its path through uh o um Well actually, just to have the the ICSLA e uh possibly to to branch ICSLA. Hmm. No. Uh-huh. Well uh so you say this one already works to uh to tell the the direction. Um would it also work if you placed uh the microphones at at the border of the table? You see, now you you have it quite central. And uh what happens if if you put them here on around the table? Would it work as well? Or You just didn't try? Or Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it is clear, this. No. Mm-hmm. No. You lose information. Um. Yeah. Well that's something with F_F_T_s. And the phase. So the magnitude you don't really use? Or and for this uh Well uh uh uh I did a speech processing uh course and I'm not sure if they a uh they also um mm learns that that. We more used the face than the magnitude. So uh I guess the Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. And what happen uh if two person are talking at the same time? This it just get two sectors that are higher than others, no? Sounds. Well uh uh Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, it's more than. No, it's uh Mm-hmm. I'll show you this afterwards. Now if you don't really detect the pitch, ch can say that uh no persons.. It's not really meaningful. Well if you do this. Somehow. Mm-hmm. Mm thanks. Well, otherwise it could also just rely on the frequency band separation and detect that way the different persons and th then you don't really know where around the table these. But uh Well d depends with how you do it. But if if you place the the microphones uh n yeah. Uh That way you can separate where where is the the voice loud with uh or the loudest. Well it's quite different thing and uh you don't really get uh a name for it. But uh At the end it it depends a bit what you want. If you are I guess it's completely other approach. So uh Expensive? Ca can you uh say a number? Okay..
Okay. Okay, uh for for uh the noise sensitive table project um we decided to um to take the noise uh as input, and uh give a feedback uh with LEDs on the table. So this is uh one of the the possibilities that were offered to us. But uh we decided to do to do uh it this way. Yes, the the first uh the first idea of the project uh was to have um the whole table covered by LEDs. But uh for the prototype of this isn't this is not the the way we implement it now. But uh in fact we have a there was th yes, th there was the the restriction that if we cover the le the table with LEDs, uh some won't be visible because uh you have uh yes. So um if there is information displayed under the the sheets uh the it won't be um very useful. So we decided to have it uh yes, thirty centimetre uh at each side. weeks.. This is for prac practical reason and uh also a matter of time. Because uh Yes. But uh th there are o other problems, like um yes, the the information display on the sheets. So we don't know if it's Yes. True. And there is uh a lot of programmes now about this implementation. Is it's not uh it's not obvious. Hmm? Still in progress. Almost done. Mm-hmm. Yes. Mm yes. Yes. Uh I have one or or two question. I don't know if you want to to begin with the the explanation about the the release. O okay. So um I have actually two questions that are uh just practical question abo about my um my implementation now. Uh i No. So and the first information is um about the the noise level. N not the noise level, the sound level. Uh because uh what you get from from the microphones is uh a curve. And um a way the way uh it is implemented now uh to detect yes, you have a uh I have packets uh for uh let's say uh this is uh this is uh not uh fixed. But uh I have packets for about um uh alpha second. So it's uh second. And uh on these packets I want to know the the sound level, the average sound level. So uh the way I do it now is uh to to take uh each top of the curves' bottoms and uh just making leverage this. But I don't know if it's it's not really um the best way to do it. But I don't know uh if Yes. Okay. So this is this the the first question. Yes. But I think uh this is two different problems. Uh the filtering must be must be done before. And after that uh if you have uh a cleaned curve and you can uh just apply uh functionally. And uh the second question was about um uh filtering and uh F_F_T_ yeah, what you can get from it. Uh general questions. Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh o yes, I will just add something. Um is there a way to uh to from one uh from one stream to uh to build two streams that correspond to the the voice of one people and the voice of the second? the Yes. No. And it it this is not uh a sound question. Sound related question. Line in. Uh yes. The the communication between the the extension and is uh of the. No, no, no. Uh okay. And the fire-wire port. And there is an extension for this this uh this device connected to it uh with uh optic fibre. Yes. Uh yes. Be because for now uh I'm just sampling the sound that uh eight thousand. So uh just uh something very very rel I could uh even uh go to lower. But uh this is just to get the the s the noise, the sound level. But uh if I want to record the conversation with uh uh a processing after th Yes, to to have a better sound quality. Uh perhaps it's better to have a X_ array, yeah. Something like that. Yes.. Okay. Mm-hmm. Sure, sure. But uh what is the the gain? In terms of uh position? Uh uh uh centimetres or uh more? Okay. M uh what you get is uh the real position or uh just uh the angle at which the the sound comes? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yes, sure. Yes. Uh because uh there there is just um four microphones that are eight. Okay, yes. Okay, but there are in uh in a plan. Okay. Because uh at at T_P_F_N_ there is a lab that is uh has done almost the same thing. But they have uh eight microphone that are uh at uh yes, the eight um the eight uh uh cor corner of uh a cube, yes. The elevation, no. But uh what is could be relevant, it's not uh almost it's not always the case with the the um Yes, the the position, the the radius of the Yes, it could be. Yes, okay. Yes. Because um because i the um the distance between the the microphone is too uh is too low to Mm-hmm. Yes, sure. Yes, but I think the the most relevant part is the um the other uh the hardware that synchronize the microphones and that. Yes. Yes. Mm not maximum. The the average on the on the packets. Uh yes, the the I take the the b I g when I go up to the the curve uh I'm uh on the at the local maximum. I take it. Then the next uh local minimum and uh taking this uh this range, doing average on it. Yes. Difference. Difference is uh is that if I just uh Mm yes. Yes. Okay. A you have uh you have fifteen implementations. Uh Yes. Okay. Sixteen. Sure. Okay, okay. Yes, and then I just uh because uh we are using um uh an open s an open source framework to do this, there is uh something, I don't know if you know i know it, uh calls Sphinx, that is doing uh s sorry. Yes. Doing um voice recognition. And uh I just use it for the for the for the microphone and the acquisition. So uh there is uh already uh an F_F_T_ uh module implemented in it. I didn't test it. But um Yes, sure. Y yes, for the for the the position,. Also for detection. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 'Kay, yes. Sure. Okay. Yes. No. Yes. Okay. Y you have to detect uh an event on one microphone and uh know when it's happened on uh on the other one. No? Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It's related to the number of microphones around. No. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay, this is a measure of the activity o okay. Th there there is a distance. But it's not very uh very effective. As as you mentioned. It's And uh from from this kind of if information you can uh let's say have uh a finger print of the user to know uh if this is the same user speaking. So Not sure. Because the the um Okay. Which range.. Yes, okay. So This is this is a bit arbitrary. Because uh perhaps uh person two will have uh some frequencies in the range of Okay. And if you reconstruct the stream from this uh this range, you will uh get something uh that is uh Okay. Mm-hmm. And you can you can um this way you can filter uh perhaps some range that are uh just very low frequencies for uh perhaps uh a noise or The yes, the fan. Okay. Yes, but but then this this is very interesting because uh this way you can detect uh if someone is talking, if someone uh has an uh some noise with uh perhaps putting his uh his cap on the on the table. Perhaps if there is a laptop and uh in one position And you can classif uh classify. And this is Yes. She' very good. Okay. Yes. Yes. And the the length of the time frame has um an inference of uh on uh which parameters Okay. Th there i uh let's say if you use a one second window. Uh the in fact the the frame lengths will be uh very uh very uh i Yes. Okay. They they won't be visible on the on the wavefo okay. Yes. But the the the the long uh the longest frame you would use would be one hundred. At most, okay. Okay, yes.. 'Kay, so you can yeah. Okay. Enter uh when user is Uh yes. And before I forg forget it uh I have one question. Uh you say you do the processing after uh afterwards. And uh what is the the cost, yes, the the length? One one or uh bit longer? Okay. Yes, but Matlab is very uh very effective for uh matrices and uh Okay. Yes. Okay. Yes. Relative, yes. Mm. Yes. And even if you use uh four microphones to get uh not good. Okay. Okay. And eight is uh is good. There i yes. But uh Yeah. Yes, one, two degree is very very small for uh for our application. Because we want we really want to detect uh if th this is the same person that is speaking or not. If there is uh an error of uh let's say uh ten, fifteen degrees and but uh it is um capable of uh seeing it as two different person. There is not problems with the Okay, and the number of sectors is uh is not dependent of uh the number of microphones? Okay. If there is uh two two person the same sector, I see. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No. Geometry is not. We have not uh thought a lot about it. Yes. F_F_T_. But th uh uh I think what is very important here is the synchronization of the microphones. Right. Okay, um uh I'm speaking about it because uh we wanted uh to do this table in uh a mid-tech way, let's say a cheap way. To have not uh very expensive tables. So I don't know if um uh what I've seen w on our website was uh that the this installation was uh a bit expensive. Uh but I'm trying to uh to to to see what is very important and uh what is not uh for Yes. Sure. Yes, sh I think you have to uh to uh It sh These are these are um some kinds of uh and this one. Yes. Okay. Expensive. Because because uh of the quality of the the And they are plug in the on the X_L_R_? Or uh Yes,. Okay, for the our we'll we we'll uh. Mm-hmm. Let's have a break.
Okay. Should I start? Maybe by presenting the project little bit. Okay, so historically it was um uh last year Prof Delambeaux in uh his C_S_C_W_ classes uh asked the student to design a table. And all the students, and Guillaume wa was a student of this class, was very excited uh to design such a table. So he decided to um to make more research on this topic. So the general topic uh is about uh interactive table, um disappearing computer, um what is the other one. Um um na uh in the general fi field of uh collaborative computer supported collaborative learning. So the idea is we have different people collaborating uh in a pedagogical purpose. And uh we know that when we put a computer in front of them, uh it doesn't help focusing on collaboration. So if we make the computing um functionalities disappearing on on the in the furniture, in the wall or other things like that, we may more efficiently support uh collaboration than the the learning. So I arrived uh in June, something like that, a couple of month ago. Uh Guillaume and uh Michael uh are two students that are working uh four four months to their master project. And they start working on two uh different uh sub-projects. So Guillaume is working on the noise sensitive table. It's uh what we are discussing about uh today. So the idea is uh okay, w we have in the lab a notion about um root mirroring. The idea is if we can provide a feedback to people working together, uh it may help them self-regulating their activity, their collaboration. So could be normative or not. In our own case we want to have uh a table that would be accessible by by students. Uh at O_P_F_L_ we are uh At O_P_F_L_ uh the learning centre will be built in a couple of uh years. So the idea we we will have plenty of rooms uh like in libraries or meeting rooms where student will arrive and work. So if we have this table uh that is accesi accessible to students if they arrive, if we provide a feedback of um who is talking, um instantly the uh at one moment or uh through time or the turn taking, uh maybe they will just by seeing an explicit uh feedback of that, they will um take profit uh of it and um Yes. The idea is to have uh peripher peripherical uh information. We don't want people to focus on uh what's going on, uh what on the feedback. So we don't want histogram or very precise information. But we will uh have LEDs that will be distant. There will be six centimetres between each LED with a blurring glass. The idea is to have more um a kind of uh art, artistic uh feedback, to have a kind of general feeling of what's going on. Something about Uh dance. For practical reasons. We kept uh one paper sheet. So uh the first shape of the table the shape of the table obviously is one of the factor on that will change the collaboration. So uh but we don't want to start with too many parameters. So we start with a table that is approximatively the tab uh of the table where we are now. And we will have uh a square shape like this that will be here and a second one that would be there. So we will have something like this. Like this. That will be the our first uh real prototype. Okay. And the so this L_E_D_ modules are being uh designed uh now. We should have them in a couple of weeks. And uh we will be able to uh start uh evaluating uh the prototypes. Uh uh about the C_S_C_W_ class, that will start at the end at the beginning of November. Uh so the student will be asked to design uh a table. So to find the shape uh of the table to get uh who the and put that uh on the um on table uh legs. And we will uh so at the beginning we wanted to put this L_E_D_ modules uh in the tables. But we won't make it because uh for solidity reason of the table. You know, it's not very uh strong uh wood. Um so we will rather beam uh the L_E_D_ on the table. So we come back to a more richer display. B but we will um restrict it to a small uh to have the same display. LED lights uh that will be distant uh six centimetres between LEDs. So we will simulate our And we have yeah. And we have the feeling that to have the information embedded in the table, make it part of the table, it I don't know, we'll we we will try uh we don't really know what uh will happen with this prototype. We are very excited about that. Okay, uh maybe before uh going on on this subject we can talk talk a little bit on uh Huh. So based on the fact that most of the P_F_L_ student have their own laptop uh the idea is the similar idea uh is to okay, people are coming on a should be able to very easily uh use some um resources offered to them. So so the idea is to help them socialising, organising their own work, and uh not in a classroom setting, but in a social place where they could gather. Different directions. Okay. So uh maybe we can focus a little uh uh bit more on the what we have done about uh the noise sensitive table. Tell you about uh what we're interested in on the so we start so Guillaume started by uh developing the application that get the audio input. So we want it to have a modular architecture to be able to improve each uh layer separately. So the audio input uh is quite basic, no? We u we use uh sound cards to to get uh the signals and to detect to uh on to ha and we have a threshold to detect uh when someone is talking, at least when the noise is uh at uh is bigger that uh specific levels. And then we get this information about people talking, not talking, and to say okay uh, this one is talking for X_ time or uh has been talking uh X_ percent of the five last minutes. Or two people are talking together. So this is more semantic uh layer. Uh we call that interaction uh models. And uh uh so when different conditions are trigger are detected, we trigger on the interaction event. So very simple one could be one person is talking. So it's uh the easy one. It's still in progress. Still in progress. So the last layer is about this visualisation. W we will uh we are thinking about the visual grammar, meaning that when we have an interaction event that is uh fired, we uh will associate uh a way of visuali visualising it. So for instance if someone is talking, uh we can just have a light that will centre on the point that is uh close to him. That could be an uh instant uh feedback. And if he has been talking maybe seventy percent of the last five minutes, as me, uh uh it it may be reflected as the um intensity or size of a s a cycle. Centre on the same point. And then if there's turn taking, we can show waves of light going from uh me to you uh or from other people. Or using the centre part of the table to show some something more about the um uh more general uh dynamic. Or laughing. Yes. In uh we can change inte so we have uh eight by eight uh two times LEDs. Each uh LED is actually three LEDs um. Th uh M_G_B_ LED. And we can change the intensity. So it's already quite a rich uh feedback. Yes. And just a last thing. So this table is uh two different things. It's uh one object that will uh g provide a feedback to the terminal users, people collaborating around uh the table. But it also a tool for us as a researcher to test uh both the interaction event we want to detect and to test the visualisation. So um we will be able to edit some uh interaction rules and the visualisation uh grammar. And uh we will be able to process to post-process some conversation just to see what happens and to uh have these um models on feedback working when people are using the table. So I think it was Yes. Um Maybe we could summarise the question we were thinking about. So basically what we want we want to know when A_ is talking, B_ is talking and uh Basic information we need.. Maybe we can uh go through the different questions and then you can organise your own? Um I would just add something. Uh we are not interested so much in sound level but uh in the level of uh the sound that corresponds to voice. Mm-mm. Okay, it was just a Okay. Go on. And I would add uh one more. It's about um because what we can uh record is uh sound uh origins. So in po uh so no sonic points. But what we are interested in is people. So the question is if someone is moving, I'm talking here, I stop talking, I'm going here, I'm talking. How to detect that it's the same people. If we want to uh integrate information to say these people has uh spoken seventy percent of the time in the five last minutes. Obviously we need to uh to know that it's the same people. So right now our practical solution is to have one uh microphone close to um every place where people are supposed to sit. So we can infer that if a sound is coming in this area, it's the same. So kind of trick. But for the beginning it's enough. And a last question that is related t uh our last if I not find another one, um About people, if someone is leaving or if someone uh maybe it would be something ev uh quite complex even for you. If someone is staying here, but is quiet or leaving, how can we detect that someone is here but quiet? Okay. I know. But how to integrate the information? Uh Not not yet. Maybe later on. But Oh, the wait and the sit.. Or putting his bag on the okay. But it was just to it's a question. I'm not sure we will talk too much about that today. Uh not directly. But it's uh related. So in a couple of days we will get this um uh the fire-wire uh box. So we will we have chosen one that has eight uh line up. So we'll be able to have line in, sorry. So we will be able to plug uh up to eight uh microphones with uh jack plugs to exhale air with the possibility of extending with eight more X_L_R_ uh microphone with another box. So we ha we have the computer, we have the the main box with the eight line ins. And it's fire-wire. It is optic. To have eight more X_L_R_ if we need it. But we are not sure to to buy it now. But we can extend it. That's uh Yes. Well We are not sure about what kind of microphone we should use. So we wanted to uh that's a first thing. So we wanted to have open possibilities. And secondly, maybe we will use this box, you know, to get uh data. I don't know if in another experiment, maybe in another project, if we want to have comments of different people around the table or o elsewhere. Uh getting uh having the possibility of using X_L_R_ microphone could be uh uh could be neat. So everything is open. No, we are not very interested in. More than one Mm-mm mm-mm. Okay. They won't have nice light uh lighting on in front of them. they would maybe careful. But Okay. So maybe w uh you could present a different work uh you have done. And uh I don't know how they are. So you told us it was different pieces, more than one integrated device. Oh uh What would be the d difference between detecting the average or detecting the maximum? What what would be the difference? What is the difference? It's a kind of filtering already? Sixty? Okay. again. Uh-huh. Okay. So it's thirty two millisecond frames taken each An idea. So something like that. So why are you overlapping? I have a rough idea. But uh what is the main interest? Mm-hmm. Yeah, and it's kind of crappy. Precise. Okay. Okay. Mm mm mm. So you use the first and last point to detect what is between. Mm-hmm. Mm-mm. Okay. So you are Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Corresponding to breath or a little noise. 'Kay. But you're talking about the microphone array here? Strong background noise. So phase Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. So the phase the time between uh audio signals for um for this microphone on this microph Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And do you get something about the um distance of the guy that is talking, or just a direction? Okay. Mm-mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. You mean that each person will have a specific frequency because i the way he's talking or his localization? It's a kind of uh speaking styles? Both. I don't really get your last uh diagram, yes. So it's at one given moment still? Okay, so you can say that f this frequency belongs more to this person and this one more to this one? But some frequency may maybe are not used neither by uh guy the guy one or the guy two. Okay. maybe they are using the same frequency. so you need to s Okay. Okay. Okay. And can you detect if someone is laughing or angry d uh there is kind of signature uh even if we can't really trust it uh uh s one hundred percent of the time. Uh And do processing on it. Okay. Pitch. It is pitch. Li okay. What is a? Excuse me? Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. So where are you represent the phase?. Okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm mm mm. Because if we are distributing the microphone all around the table, then we come back to the energy solution? Is it what you say? With the energy dissolution or with uh F_F_T_ too? Okay. But there are many many things. The difference between the Mm-hmm. Mm mm yeah. What would be the difference? You will not compare each mic with uh all the other one. But just comparing this one with the Mm okay. Okay. But what are uh-uh. So what are this mic for instance, the electret mic. Omni-directional? Electret? Okay. Yes. And when you were talking about comparing energy in the case where a microphone would be distributed all around the table, uh you're comparing energy and the time delay? Because time delay is is too short to be compared or can be neglected? Okay. Okay, okay. Yeah. It's time. Cool.",IN1008
"If not more, yeah. Okay. Okay. So the three of you and let's see m um myself and Maarika, who's not here, and but I think so it it occasionally Melissa will all be doing checking of the transcriptions. So this is the second pass these transcriptions are receiving and that's pretty straight-forward. I think you all kn basically have an idea what's involved. Um but the extra step that we're asking you to do f in this case is to look at the silent regions and listen to them for each channel and um make sure that no back-channels were lost for example, um yeah, back-channels is what you n typically would find, although by and large these are gonna be silent. So So you can um start s checking by y well you you know, you can order it in any way you like, but um start with the first channel and go through it entirely. Um I would recommend, I've found that it's easier when you're checking and you're trying to make sure the boundaries are right for a speech segment, I would recommend, like say this one, go down here to the uh trascription transcription tier and select that it so that uh when you play, you're certain that when it stops, you've caught the whole speech signal for that utterance and haven't lost any signal information. Um otherwise it it's liable to keep on running, and you might not notice where it where it finishes. So it it takes a little time. But um Alternatively, I you you could just listen to the speech segments again and make sure everything is correct for those, and so you could just hit um And then Like that. And then go back and check the the silence regions. How it if if you wanna make your job a little more interesting, you can d do it in m different ways on a different day. It doesn't matter. As long as it gets done. So Yeah, yeah, you're doing so that's that's the role of the checker is to check what's said in the silent regions uh in the speech regions and then make sure nothing was lost in the silent regions. You're also um responsible for resolving any um uncertainties that were marked by the original transcriber. And and you know, of course there are gonna be m many situations where you like the first transcriber can't make any sense of it. And in that case, it will be up to you to use the at symbol. Um and that can be used uh to represent one um unintelligible word or multiple intelligible words, but just use one at symbol. Um yeah, mm-hmm, exactly. And so that um once you go through all the s um speech regions and all the um non-speech regions, an o you could make another step of doing a search using um going under the edit menu you can do a search for, yeah, find replace for open parentheses and that'll take you to any that it any that the first transcriber might have marked out. So there's one. And then you can just resolve those all one by one as as a different set of um changes altogether. And and likewise for the double question marks. Just once you've gone through um and resolved all the open parentheses, you can do the same for op uh double question marks. And um and like I said, if you if you can't make any sense of it, then just use the at symbol. If you can um, just give it, you know, give it your best guess in these cases. If Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it's I would uh if you're v if you're quite certain, then I would go ahead and um type what you think it was said. If if you v think that n y there's maybe a th thirty percent chance you're wrong or or more Yeah. Right. So maybe a good idea would be to listen to each channel one by one, do listen to the silent and non-silent regions and make all those corrections, leave the unknowns, the um ambiguities, the uncertainties uncertainties until later. So go through all the channels and do that, and then um then you should have the context from all four speakers, and then go back and do those searches one by one for each channel. How would that be? Does that sound good? Okay. You'll you'll know all too well what was said in this meeting by the time you Yeah. Yeah, I think that would be really helpful. That would help us um, you know, nab a good number of those uncertainties. Mm. Choose one, it c I mean y think of it from a speech recognition point of view again. And always this should be this should motivate you. Yeah. What is most robust for a speech recognition and and leave out anything So you're well geared towards this task. Um So I've gone through Sorry. Oh no no no. Go ahead, go ahead. Too many. Okay okay. So um this is one I've gone through. I've just done one channel. And there were lots of lots and lots and lots of things as you can see. 'Cause I've got square brackets around all the things that need to be changed. Um so this person didn't ha um th obviously didn't know about capitalisation. So just about every utterance needs to be capitalised and and needs the end punctuation. Yeah. Um, no no no. Whatever um makes sense to you. Um but no, it it can continue into the next segment and that's perfectly fine. Um Yeah. Yeah. I'll review some of these things um after I go through this a bit um just to re-cap. Th these are things that I've after checking um t everybody's work um, these are things that were commonly left out or, you know misc mis-transcribed, whatever. So I'll go over those t as an opportunity to use the white-board. Um um okay. So uh this person left out a lot of end punctuation and um here's a case where I think she was transcribing an out-breath um or possibly an in-breath uh t uh in and used the hash mark. In any case, I didn't hear anything and and you shouldn't be transcribing in-breaths or out-breaths. That's n information we don't need. Oh, you know, this is the head-set mic and I heard something there. It was but it wa yeah, it was a bit of a yeah, it was creaky, so yeah f uh Yeah, well I didn't think it was im let's see, wait. Yeah. S there's there's actually quite a bit more in there than than I heard before. This is so I w I heard a creaky voice, and it was audible of the level of the rest of the speech. So I would I would keep that. I think that's good. Oh, okay. I was adding that, that's what I was doing. That makes sense. Okay, there you go. Um so there's things like that. Um sh there's a missing false start here um that didn't get caught. So I added that in. Um so that that's something that's quite common in the transcriptions that I've looked at. Missed false starts, um missed m Try to get it right. I mean the it I think syllables should be accounted for for th Yeah, well don't let it drive you crazy, 'cause there is one speaker Melissa just played for me today and he stutters horribly. I mean I I I'd you know, it's unfortunate for him and for us 'cause it's really gonna be a nightmare to transcribe. So you will have to draw the line somewhere. But if you c if it's say four repeated um if the word is repeated four times, uh then that's not too hard to count. I haven't come across something that's been I haven't come across anything exceeding four, I don't think. Have you? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Make your best guess. Try to listen to it carefully enough, but not not so that you're obsessing over it for too long. I would say. Alright. Well there again, f uh think about robustness and speech uh recognition and it really doesn't matter. If it's a word fragment, who cares. It you're marking it as a fragment, and that's what's important. Well um I wouldn't de be using the star so liberally um for a non-native speaker. Mm-hmm. Well, right, right. Um I mean and and for that matter a lot of n native English speakers' realisations aren't going to be so true to um Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, I wouldn't bother to mark all of those instances though. No, I mean yeah, they're they're uh you're gonna find that for any speaker, they have a set way of of realising these things. And and it's just like Fiona was saying, um that the the word that stands out is something really uh aberrant. Like um I'm thinking of I I've used this example before, there's a guy who says project instead of product and uh it's something like project and it's probably just his his pronunciation of of. Yeah. Well, it it they were clearly talking about a product. So so uh I m I marked that as a m uh mispronunciation or s or something to flag anyway. Oh, evaluation. Yeah, I I've I remember that. That one I would I would flag, just like you did. It that's something definitely to mark up. Mm yeah. That's good. That's good. Alright. Yeah, I kn I don't know what to s tell you about n um certain speakers. I it's just something we have to deal with. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So oop, I lost my lapel lapel mic. Yeah. Wait. Oops. Least I won't be transcribing the What do I care? Okay, so um there've there've been lots of missed filled pauses. Everybody seems to miss those, some more than others. So just really keep an ear out for those. Um Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I I'm not sure, I miss them plenty myself. But um this this second pass we should really try to catch all of them or at least most of th yeah. No, no. After. Okay. Yeah, it should be after every um acronym letter. Yeah, yeah. So at this point the um the only file that's been checked is Melissa one that Melissa did, and that was checked by me. Um so w we we're starting fresh with these and, you know, changes like that that were just announced we'll we'll be able to catch for these first passes. So yeah, y if you do see um something like um U_H_M_ for um, you you would change that to the regularised v version. Um and we just ch you know, this is arbitrary, but we had to choose something and not let it get too convoluted with um with choice. Here's Uh-huh. Mm-hmm, there. Um I Yeah, yeah. So it's not necessarily restarting the sentence, but just a restart of any type. A phrase. Yeah. Thank you for that description, Beata. Here's a uh so that answers your question about that answers your question about this one up here? Okay. Here's where I've I heard a another sound, another false start. Um or a stutter, I would say. Let me see. Oh yeah. I'm not seeing where this is. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. So, that kind of thing. And there was a vowel in there, but you noticed that she just used the and that's fine. The the letter D_. That's she would like see. She Oh, sorry. I didn't go f back far enough. Yes. Um where is that. Yes, she's so she spelled it wrong. Um uh up here. Yeah, so I d I mentioned that because of spelling. And yes, any g I It's one word. So I d I just said spelling. It's an admonishment. Sorry? Uh like A_T_ is uh Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you have any questions about spellings, I i I think I m might have sent an email to this effect, just check the Oxford English Dictionary online. Uh and that's that will be our guide. Um, so a as far as I know, this is just missing an E_ cetera. Um but anyway. You can We've considered experimenting with running this through a spell check. You could take this as an Emacs file and run a spell check on it. But I think it would slow things down too much. So just hopefully i in going through this very carefully you're going to notice these misspellings. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah, I th I think you're right. So we'll we will just hope that you catch it. Um That's what we'll do. Okay. So Sorry. So I think she just she didn't catch the full form. Right, right. Yeah. She I think she meant to use the infinitive, but she just left off the to. A space between She would like see. She would like see. Yes yes yes, you're right. Yeah. Exactly. Uh that was what you were m remarking about. Okay. There we go. Let me save that. Okay. What else? Um be careful about um finding mis-transcriptions. So um So she t she transcribed that as would. And so Well, I think it's quite clear there. I mean obviously there are gonna be ca No, you try to keep it as true to what's being said. Then use um Mm-hmm. I'd have to hear it, because it m sounds like it could be a fragment. Uh it ju I'd just have to hear it. Um M I'd you don't want to b um be prescriptive and and type what you think they should've said. But but I I I do know the type of scenario you're describing. I just it's just hard to answer that without hearing something. Mm. Yeah, they should all I I stopped marking them, 'cause there are just too many. But Uh let's see. Oh yeah, y you're right. Right. That's right. Okay. There was a yes in there. Um and Yes. So another missed false start. Um There was creakiness on the she. But you don't need to mark that as a separate sound. Um Mm. If it sounds like um the laughter is just um interrupting a an utterance that continues after the laughter, I wouldn't worry about capitalising. If you hear just laughter on either side, yeah, do that. Yeah, yeah, mm I don't know, we'll have to I'll Okay, so laughter during speech. I'll f I'll talk to Melissa and Jean. S Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No, we don't have any qual tags like they use. But um I'll f I'll I'll figure that one out and put it up on the wiki or email you. Good question. I've come across that as well. Mm, see. Oh yeah, I don't know what that that noise was indicating. Um we can skip on. There are other types of things I wanna point out. Um let's see. Okay. Did you Did she say circuit? I didn't really hear that. So would would you have been tempted to put an asterisk after that? Uh yeah. Oh, okay. No, not necessarily. No, it's just something that the speech recognizer is liable to trip up on, I think. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Um y that may be, but I probably would flag it. I depending on how how different the vowel sound was. It's gonna be your call in a lot of these cases. Mm. Okay, here Here's a case of um where I found it n uh found a case of discontinuity. But you know, because she's a non-native English speaker, I don't I don't know. Maybe that was grammatically n uh unmarked for her. If you know what I mean. Maybe that wasn't uh her re-starting, maybe sh that was Mm mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So again I don't know. That w that was my reflex at the time to put that there. But Yeah. Well Unless you kinda get Right. Uh yeah, yeah. Yeah, I would type it as two. Mm okay, I'm gonna skip ahead. Oh, let's see, there was a c So I I hear she would quite clearly there and I think a good number of them you'll be able to resolve just just helps to have the context and be able to listen to it again. Well. Okay. Yes, it could be a lot of things. Um So there is there is another case where there wasn't a space between uh a non-word fragment and um a re-start. Okay. What else. There is an extra little symbol in here, and that was just kinda carelessness. Um So d even if it's something as brief as mm-hmm, we're we're gonna go ahead and capitalise that. And Maarika asked me what to do in the case of an utterance just consisting of laughter, do we do we use punctuation in these cases, and I don't know. I haven't been. I don't think it's necessary. Yeah. Uh no. Um Delete and collapse. I'm trying to underst I'm trying to interpret my note here. Delete and collapse the surrounding segments. Okay, I guess there there just really wasn't enough to transcribe there. Yeah. Yeah. So like I said, click down here just to if you haven't learned that trick already. And that won't play any surrounding segments. So there's nothing there worth transcribing. Um Uh Uh-huh. This one? Oh so you haven't put a hyphen there. I see, I see. Yeah. Okay. Commas. Commas did you say? Oh For g for that s type of situation? Yeah, okay. Commas are fine. I mean they're eventually they're going to be extracted globally, so it doesn't matter how you use the comma. Yeah, we can just wipe them out in one fell swoop. I I am too. I I like commas and then uh Steve Renals, who's project manager, had a look at m I think it was my transcriptions. What are all these commas doing in here? But he didn't he ultimately he said it wasn't a problem. They will I th they'll help in the case of discourse marking, but his point was that they're really subjective, I mean something that you the transcriber here Yeah, yeah. I really like using commas. Oh. Sh oh, she spelled cutest um with an I_, so that that's just something I pointed out. Okay, what else? Um So here's let's see. Now this was our So she typed uh our and I I didn't quite hear that. But But I you can see how it could've been, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Right. And you can never know, but if it fits well enough as a as an indefinite article, then you might as well. Oh, I was s I was suggesting that sh it be uh instead of our. But Yeah, I it's tricky, it gets ambiguous. Um I don't know. Uh what's this? Well oh, she's I hear the well there. The but this being a head-set mic channel m may make it easier to hear. She transcribed from the lapel mic. Uh Oh. Oh. Oh God. And you transcribed that speaker entirely? If that comes up again, we've got um headset mic files now. In fact, they replaced all the lapel mic files on the M_M_M_ server with head-set mic files, which we weren't asking them to do, but anyway they did it. And so now we don't have the lapel mic files. Apparently the headset mic files are are just a bit louder. And so you'll f probably find yourself turning the volume down considerably. But but apparently other than that they're just as good. But let us know, because we can retrieve the the other files. Yeah. Oh. Okay. I don't think I'm gonna go through uh any more of these, because I I think I've gotten through most of the types that I meant to point out. Uh right, right. Um what are we going to do for that. I d I did see s I've been looking at some guidelines for another corpus and I did see something about proper names, so I'll I'll have a look at that and see how we can handle that here. What Uh yeah, quite possibly, but since it's coming from ICSI uh it's coming from IDIAP in Switzerland, yeah, it w it should be easy enough to get, but it's it's one other step, you know, emailing somebody to find out who knows this information. Anyway, it's Yeah, yeah, because everyone signs a consent form when they participate in the experiment. So we ought to be able to get that. But but there shou we should also have a w a means of dealing with proper names when we don't know what it is or how it might be spelled at all and and flagging that in in some way. So I'll th I'll I'll try to address both things. Oh, just just type Mister fully. I M_I_S_T_E_R_, yeah. And same with missus, M_I_S_S_U_S_, I believe. Is it I believe I believe check check the dictionary. That yeah, but you would never um type the abbreviated spelling for anything. Um well, I'm sure there's a spelling in the O_E_D_, yeah. Uh-huh. Oh right. So the transcriber's enclosing everything in carets, and what you would do is That's a good question, because you will be leaving question marks there. Um okay. Right. Um it shouldn't, because things are going to be left like the asterisk will be left for the proc the subsequent processing. But carets with question marks in-between would have to be resolved in some way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I suppose that's all we can do really. You're not supposed to be polyglot transcribers here. Oh yeah yeah. If you if if f it's a foreign word and you know what it is, just enclose it in carets. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. If you if you're confident that you've got a fair grasp on French for example, why not. Yeah. Okay. Um there is there is just one other thing, she she typed okay um in caps. O_ c c O_ capital O_ capital K_ and huge no-no, I don't know why she missed that in the in the guidelines. Yeah. It is O_K_A_Y_. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, it will be your jobs to catch all of these things. So no um n no transcriber will be checking no checker will be checking their t own transcription. Yes. Yes. So we will catch these things more efficiently, I think. And on so I'll just go up to the board do I have to keep this stuff on? Oh yeah, they've got clips. Right, I'm mobile. Alright. Okay. So I guess just for the sake of using the white-board and killing a little more time I'll just write down the things that are most common to be checked. So let's see. So oh, okay. Now. Okay, s alright. Rather this is a list of things to do as the checker. So you wanna listen to the silent regions. Then check the speech regions. And as part of that you want to um check the boundaries. And oh, by the way, this should be um Um transcribe any missed speech. And just let's see what else. Okay. And within this checking the speech segments, you want to listen for or look for missed um Look for missed punctuation, filled pauses, words in stuttering. And if you have um if you have a stuttered word, you don't need to use the hyphen to mark discontinuity. It's just so if somebody says the the, then it's just the the. Um words in st uh And what else. Try to get f false starts. Short words, make sure with little words like the and uh, little articles and that kind of thing don't get omitted. Um short words and word fragments. Those are the commonly missed things. And then um look for cases of mis-transcription Seems so silly to be writing this all. But anyway, Mis-transcription, so make sure if the speaker said will, you type will not would or um if they say we, even though it might be more grammatically correct to type we're, um that kind of thing. Um tha cases of ellipsis, where um maybe the transcriber typed them, but really what was said was 'em, so where you use the apostrophe. And look for capitalisation I'm not gonna gonna do any more of this. Capitalisation. Spelling. Um, use the O_E_D_ to check on things you don't know about. Um refer to the wiki for all regularised spellings and f for things like filled pauses. Oh, was that W And then, yeah, capitalise the K_. Yeah. And I think smells really good. I used to always love smelling markers. What else did I find. Um the so make sure the da the dash, the hyphen, whatever you call it, is being used appropriately in cases of discontinuity, um but not in stuttering, like I said. And and don't use it when the utterance is clearly continued in the next segment or whatever. Um don't transcribe in-breaths or out-breaths. And okay should never be um two capital letters, it should be O_K_A_Y_. Um and one other thing is to break break up long segments if you find any. So Yeah, but that's a kind of crude guideline. I'd I'd say just anything that seems unmanageable. Ah. Yeah, yeah. Really uh it it means nothing to say a minute, it's just a g a really crude guideline. I would just try to keep segments very manageable um and a but u you know, use these wave-forms to help you. And you can adjust the resolution so that Oh. That didn't help me too much, but you can use this little slide bar to adjust the resolution. Actually that doesn't seem to be working. Which o Yeah. Right, okay, okay. So yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh okay, right. Uh-huh. Hmm? Ah right, that's good. Okay. That's excellent. Alright. Oh that's that's good to know. Okay. Yeah, so to help you make cuts, just look look f you know, use this wave-form and make sure you're not l losing any signal information. But um cutting segments down is a l a low priority, but it it will help ultimately, I think, post-processing wise. I don't Yeah, you don't don't get excessive about it. 'Cause that just ends up taking too much time. But I d I think from a speech recognition point of view it shouldn't matter, these segments being whatever length that they happen to be. I've seen other p people's transcription guidelines like f for the um ICSI project at Berkeley and elsewhere say indicating that it really doesn't matter and it's the point is just to get 'em into manageable units. And Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's true actually, that's the best reason for cutting them down, but hopefully the that'll be done during the first pass, because that's the whole point. Making the checkers' job a little easier. Um and then, yeah, just m um be sure after you've gone through the four channels to um do a search on all the unknowns, all the um cases of ambiguity or whatever. And what else was I gonna say? The way we'll be allocating this is is the same as before, th it's gonna be on the th the same the same page, just further down. Scroll down, you'll see w all the files. And uh I've already allocated some some things to be checked. So if you run out of work, go ahead and start checking, because this is something that's um considerably um bottle-necked at the moment. Yeah, I'd say for now um w we don't even have uh much new stuff to be uh to be gone over for a first pass. So it's important that we d um do this second pass. And I've indicated in a column whether something is priority. M I think I high typed high if it's high priority. Um so d those would be the ones you would focus on first, obviously. And when it come you don't want to change the file-name in any way. Just keep it the same. Um there there is going to be a checking in procedure. I don't know if anybody's mentioned this before, but you'll you'll know about this with the C_V_S_ server. So th Right, but it's be s y similar. But they're they're creating a their a guy Jonathan is creating a web form for you to do this all very simply and like just um upload everything that you've uh up upload the file that you've transcribed and and you'll be noting whether it's the first pass or the second pass and y your name um as the person who did that particular pass. And that will happen soon. I'll let you know. Yeah. Yeah, you'll have to I would suggest creating a f folder um called files to be checked or something like that. Yeah, and then within that create a s create sub-folders for the the given meeting and you'll have to get all the sound files unfortunately from the M_M_M_ server on your own, because the the AMI server's not very reliable for getting these sound files uncorrupted. So you'll have to get all the sound files from the M_M_M_ server and the person's transcription file should be in that folder where you're putting yours. Um and then you'll just uh yeah d you'll copy that over, you won't don't move it over, because we wanna have multiple versions of these things, but yeah, copy it into your directory and keep the same name. And then when you check it in, it will automatically be registered even though the the first pass was checked in when we're doing this checking in business, um it will know which pass it is, but I think you'll also be indicating that as well. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's it' actually six what is it? Is it three months, I think? Yeah. Yeah. They're they're three-month contracts and now, if you can't keep that, that's fine. But it's just a logistic thing with personnel where where we ha that was the minimum we were able to offer a contract for. So if you have to bow out, let us know as soon as you know when you you're gonna have to stop. Yeah, yeah, obviously those kinds of things are things we'll have to work around, but um yeah, it's just one of those details. Mm-hmm. I should think so. I mean the whole point w of keeping well, as long as you're able to, yeah, work out use of your computer with the other person, that's fine, yeah. The the whole point of having m regular hours was to make sure that somebody was here to answer your questions. But you've got keys, so so you should be able to get in during odd hours if if you wanted to work. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't see why not, as long as you're, you know, doing your given set of hours for the week. Yeah. And um yeah. Paym I I think you'll all be paid. I think you'll all be paid uh well, have you not Mm. Okay. Okay. Really? No, that's certainly not necessary. Mm no. Well it If you have any th problems like that, mm um see Caroline Hastings. I mean if it's for this job and and getting paid, that that's not necessary and Caroline Hastings ought to be able to help you sort that out. But j also if if pay is a matter um like if it's a matter that you haven't gotten paid for some reason, um I hope that's not not the case. Mm-hmm. Talk to Caroline. Yeah, 'cause I've I really don't know um why that would be. I'm here full-time now, so I'll I'll be here m Monday through Friday and I l I leave at four now, so you won't find me anytime after that. But Yeah, my husband's at home with the baby. Yeah, yeah. He's uh four and half months. It's very lovely. A nice jolly little baby. Yeah, well um only as of Friday actually. So he was uh I was just telling Melissa this do you want us to stop? Yeah, yeah. Yeah yeah. Oh good, that worked out well.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Find replace, yeah. Uh-huh. Oh yeah. How much should you want um I had a few times where I thought well, it could be this, but if you're not entirely sure that it could be, 'cause it c it could be a combination of something else, like put the guess down or leave it as ambiguous in some way. Right. There's a chance they could be. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm, that's what I've been doing so far. It took li it like the third time 'til I thought oh, you're saying F_ five. It just came out of nowhere. But if there's a chance that it's equally likely that they could have said something or they could have said something like ice cream and I scream, then just choose one and leave it, right. Mm-hmm. We just started our speech recognition assignment just now. You're an S_L_P_ person. You survived S_P_ one and S_P_ two. We have two new teachers for S_P_ two. And uh I'll ask you later on like if you still have your notes. Mm the hyph And you only use the hyphen I think when the sentence is definitely not continuing anywhere. As in like it's Mm-hmm. Right. It was the creaky voice. Creaky voice. But it is c really connected to the word. Can we hear it again? From the from the And sometimes with the I would be thinking, are you anticipating a or you're you t trying to say the and you're just saying the the the the the. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I try to take consistency, if they always stress the wrong part of the word, then I think okay, I'll let that in, but if if it comes out and like one word is Ah. Well, at the moment we have a lecturer that can I can never quite s tell if he's saying problem or programme. Programme problem. And it I can't actually say but when I'm listening to, I'm thinking And I can't tell. Hope he's not involved with these actually. I hope he's not involved with this. That'll give some transcriber a headache. It's easy to, 'cause you're so used to t t tuning them out, and you know it's easy when I go back over I normally g like go back to the beginning, do a quick pass of the main sections again and think ah yeah. Mm-hmm. That's what I thought the first day as well. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So if they pause, just where you've got it highlighted at the moment That wor the hyphen. So I have to re-do the meetings from the minutes from the last meeting. Was she was that a like w r real definite I'm starting a new sentence here, 'cause I'd sometime if it sounds like he could carry on saying the whole sentence, I sometimes don't have a hyphen there. But is it a t any hesitation? Okay. Okay. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Just one to the next door, yeah. Oh goodness, who would know what that was uh if somebody that didn't know about linguistics were trying to transcribe S_ node. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry? Yes, yeah. You're three lines in. What's the What's the C_? Is that a There's a d judgment is that that Oh, I've not used that button yet. In the dictionary here it's one word. Yeah. Would give Emacs a headache as well. Yeah. Yeah, the C_. Um She was cutting off rather than saying she would like s to have see something. Is a whole word. Yeah. 'Kay. Thanks, that's what I was asking. I should've just said it that way. Yeah. Uh-huh. Should it? 'Cause the loose uh is continuing from one sentence, isn't it? Was there? Okay. Oh yeah. Sometimes I've made buts after la like words after laughter, I've made them capitalised, 'cause I've not been sure if there's an if the laughter's been cutting everything off. Mm-hmm. During. Was that circuit? I figure if she is a person that calls circuit circuit I'm not sure if she did. Just um if it's her, I just caught the end of it and No, not for that one. But I had one person who said circuit. The. Mm-hmm. Yeah, something like if ha I did that one 'cause it is well, a language teacher wouldn't low allow that to mo move on to the next stage. That wouldn't they wouldn't let that pass. Sort of. Or I wouldn't. If somebody that, I'd point it out to them. Yeah, 'cause otherwise you could end up putting a hyphen after every hesitation mark that you have. Just if Just a prosodic marker rather than an actual hesitation. Uh as in a whole s like back-channel. Oh yeah, sorry. I th I just read the rest of the sentence. Yeah. No. 'Cause it's not linguistic. Well, not yeah. I know, I yeah, you could think of an argu Or should we start it if we start the conversation in the common room, like is laughter linguistic, then they could come up with a theory. But Oh, d Oh, I just noticed the the random yeahs, like with having the hyphen before they're s Uh if you scroll up a little way. Yeah, that ha um the second one from the top. Thinking I'm gonna have to go back and find my places where I've had someone pausing and then saying yeah yeah and then this that I've not had I need to go back and find uh p put hyphens in. Hyphens or commas? Yeah. No, s alright. No, I've I've th I've sort it out. Alright, okay. So we don't have to worry about commas. Okay. Yeah. I I read somebody's P_H_D_ proposals yesterday and s and it's saying, well, you could have a comma in here and one there and Cutest? Thank you. That one step behind. Oh. So which did you dec uh did Evaluation. The z z Evaluala? Yeah. I've had one person with a dodgy headphone with with dodgy something where most of the time it's it's as if they've got their hand over something. Yes, the uh yeah, it w it's for Right. Hmm. Right. Thank you for the warning. Right. Lot of people that say is this on and they hit it a few times. No. How about names that somebody says the name of somebody and you think, who? And you don't know how to spell the name or if you heard the right name. Sorry? Mister Ed. Oh it Mister Ed. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay. What was Mister again? I can't remember seeing how to transcribe Mister. M_ M_R_ Mister Sorry? Missus? Um Right. Is that Yeah. Not come across any yet. Oh. And not accidentally translating in the process. Oh yeah, I saw it there. There it was. Okay, oops. Checking their own transcription. No transcriber will be checking their own transcriptions. Guess it depends how far you can stretch. Oh yeah, 'cause every time somebody'd be going over there you'd hear all this sound of And about five or six breaks in the between is the making it a. looks like some piece of medical equipment. Mm-hmm. Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh. Mm-hmm. I just remembered one. Okay, when it's just as 'kay, but it's at the beginning of a sentence, should the K_ be capitalised? Good. You've been doing this too long. Grease paint. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The arrows by the resolution. Not that one. The other arrow next to it. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Ooh. Ah. That might have made it s 'cause I I appear to have nothing. But I was hearing stuff, but I g there was nothing on my wave-form. It's kinda hard to find where everything was. Control panel. Right. I think I've gone a bit far in cutting mine down at the moment. Mm-hmm. No, probably not. No. Mm-hmm. Easy for checking at any rate, rather than having to listen to a whole Anything. Mm-hmm. The work allocation page. Right. It do yes. Checking in page. Oh right. Mm-hmm. Uh it's vaguely connected question. Um, you You'll know. Um originally the like when we first like replied, say yes if you're interested in doing this, it said six weeks, and the contracts say eighth of May, which is longer in advance than which is a greater amount of time than six weeks. That's Okay. Right. Okay, that's. Cool. Right. When it gets into the holidays and we're not necessarily around in the holidays and and Right. Just checking. Or else you can like p yes. And if you can plug microphones into Apple Appleton Tower computers, I can do it there as well if you wanted me We could meet up and have a session. That's a nice way to put it. I'm having sort some s I'm having to sort some tax stuff out before I can even send my stuff in, 'cause I need to make sure I'm sending them the right form. But they won't even know what examining board I got my A_ levels in. Yeah, for human resources. I thought, surely you don't need that information, 'cause it took me it was about to take me half an hour well it did when I was like just going through the forms and filling in all the details, I thought I'm not going to spend w A couple of hours getting photo-copies of degree certificates to give you for your files if I'm just gonna be here a good th they won't I think it th at one place it said give us copies of degrees? Oh, maybe I'm getting mixed up with something else, but it wanted a A_ level like examining board, which seemed a bit ridiculous. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Didn't think so. Mm. Alright. Oh, so it is your baby then on the photos. One assumes this. How old now? Oh. Yeah, that's the question I was just gonna ask, does he sleep? Wow. Alright. Oh, do we have to tick our note thing again when we finish this? To say that we've
Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. In between. Yeah. So we so are we checking what's actually been transcribed already as well as the silences? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh okay.. Oh, alright 'kay. Mm yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it does tend to help. Yeah. Once you've been through the passage, you've worked out what they're talking about, you know. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You know, when you get like um someone's talking and there's they sort of pause in the middle of a sentence that's long enough for it to put a break in, but they're actually sort of carrying on the sentence, do you have to capitalise each time you transcribe a bit if it's mid No no no no. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Just okay. So it's put the hyphen and then Right. Okay. Oh right, okay. I've done a few of those wrong then when someone comes to check it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. You know, um you standardised all the the filled pauses, the uh and do we need to go through and change ones that people did differently. Like if I where I've written E_R_ for uh, change it all to U_ H_, that sort of thing? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, just change it to um. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. We do the meeting. The minutes, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Where you've written at et cetera, is that how we're supposed to be writing it? Okay. Yeah. Et cetera. Okay. Mm.. Okay. Okay. That one was clear. Okay. Yeah. How do you know it's that? Cir circuit. Oops. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Right. Someone's gonna have fun transcribing that now. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Actually, um a couple of times where they've repeated a word, I've put a comma between them. Should that be no comma? Oh, r okay. Right. Oh right, okay. Okay. 'Cause I get I get quite prolific with my commas at times. So um Okay. Okay, cool. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. E_ S_ T_. Oh okay. Yeah. Sometimes you get like an uh and it g you're not sure if it's an, an A_, yeah, or an m it Yeah. As an. Yeah, do it as Okay. Several vowels in there. Yeah. That's harsh. Oh okay. Right. Mm. Mister Ed? Yeah. Or myst mystery Ed or something. Yeah. Mm-hmm. M_ I_ S_ T_ E_ R_. Okay, Missus. Missus. Yeah. M_ I_ Z_? Yeah. So um about um foreign words, what do we when we're checking um if we come up something so we just leave it as Yeah. I got one, which I it was French, so I knew how to ex spell it. Yeah. I mean if it's in carets and they know it's foreign, does that matter? Yeah, and the at symbol. Or could we just change it to an at between the carets? 'Cause it's only intelligible theoretically. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Are we doing okay just as O_ K_, not as a O_K_A_Y_? A_ Y_, alright, oops. Someone's gonna find some of those. Yeah. Checking their own work. Right. Have to remember that one now. D Yeah. Wrestling to the white-board. Wow. Okay. W Okay. Yeah, b Oh. Is that zoom in? Wow. I turned the page. Okay So is this the priority then? Transcri yeah. Mm-hmm. Turn the page. Did you get the little buzz buzz? So do we just open the file as we open the files for the first pass, like open up the sound file and then it sh In your home directory. Okay. Yep. Okay. Then you'll lose it, yeah. Okay. Sh Yeah, someone said three months. Yeah. Oh, okay. Mm. Okay. Once we actually get into the like um Easter holidays, 'cause we're at having lectures at the moment, can we be more flexible with our hours if we wanna sort of I mean depending on who's using the computers. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, sure. Yes. Yep. If want Okay. Know what you're doing. Phew. Oh. Yeah.. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Wow. Okay. Oh yeah. Absolutely.
More. It's usually a context problem, because I think sometimes if it's not intelligible you either tend to because you really want it to fit the context, um you tend to take the closest actual word that would fit the context, or if it sometimes it sounds very clear as a word itself, but then wouldn't make sense at all, and then you m question, you know, second-guess whether it's really what you heard. Mm. Hmm. Be robust. That's always fun. I've done that too. Oh, never I I don't wanna interrupt it. Uh uh when I did my masters um I took uh S_P_ one and S_P_ two with Simon King. Yes. And actually I've done quite well in S_P_ one, I've done it a bit worse in S_P_ two because it was a l a lot more challenging. Okay. Yeah. Right. Okay. Back to the topic. Yeah. I think that's actually the only case where you don't or where you're not supposed to capitalise, right? So if it's quite clear that the sentence is being carried on, the p you know, the sentence from the previous segment is being carried on, then that's when you don't capitalise. Otherwise you do. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you sometimes you don't know really whether it's a mic noise or that person is making that noise. Yeah. Okay. And how exact do we have to be there? Because um you know, some people tend to stutter more than others and then they would have a false start four or five times in a row. And how important is it to listen to it really until you've got the exact number of a things right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, 'cause sometimes they go you know, like that, and then you're not really sure whether it's three times or four yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, it's not that the word is if the word were the whole word were being used four times, that wouldn't have been that difficult, but sometimes it's just a false start, which is really just maybe one or one and a half phones and then repeated and then you don't really know whether one is a long duration of one or whether it's actually two, and that kind of thing, so it's I think it was a word starting with D_ and the person was going or s you know. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Well, speaking about Speaking about robustness, if if somebody has an accent that you can only really understand what they're saying due to world knowledge yeah, it what they say, it doesn't really actually sound at all, you know, what it is, then do you transcribe more phonetically or do you put uh uh a star of after every single one word? Or Yeah, that's what I thought, that you're not supposed to do it, but um the one there's one I'm transcribing right now, you know, a whole batch of dialogues where uh all four participants are non-native, and there's especially one there that um I think he's Eastern European and I think that's the only reason I can understand what he's saying at all, because I'm Eastern European and uh but if we would just play it I think to a recognizer, then what he says, you know, the way he realises words, sounds nothing at all like it it should be. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's less of a s it's less of a stress. It's really like uh his uh, I don't know, just the phonemes sounding differently. Well, you can't really, because it would be all of it. Oh. Yeah. Oh, I think I've transcribed him and I had project at all um evolution criteria. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Yeah. And one guy who was saying evolution each time he meant evaluation, and it took me a whole dialogue Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but that's really something I would always transcribe it, you know, for lack of better knowledge or lack of context, and then at the end of the dialogue it dawned on me that he actually meant evaluation, and then I went back and replaced I replaced it in the whole transcription. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, basically th I think just do your best and hope for the best. Well, we have both head-set and lapel transcription. So it's not too bad. Yeah, let's have Maarika transcribe that. Mm-hmm. Um sorry, I'm just seeing this with the T_V_, there is T_ underscore V_ underscore. I thought we're just supposed to use the underscore between letters? No? Okay, sorry, then I've done it wrong so far. Okay. But it is a back-track. Yeah, I think of it in terms of, you know, not even maybe to well, if I th if you think of it in terms of a syntactic tree, it n doesn't have to go back all the way to the S_ node, but it just m it might go back to the last node or something like that. Yeah. Well it's just my way of of knowing if it w sorry, 'cause linguistics is all I've ever known. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Where? Oh, et cetera.. Is it one word or is it two words? Okay. Because I thought it would be like et alii. But in sh it isn't it in Latin like et cetera, like et alii or No no no, like et w you know, when you have uh when you have a citation and you say et al, it means and others, et et al et alii is the full word, and et cetera means and following. So Yeah. Oh in it is, okay, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think Yeah, I think i if somebody could write I don't know how difficult it would be in practice to write a script that would ignore um all the word fragments, anything with a hyphen. Then a spell-check might make make sense. But uh to just use simple Emacs, it will uh basically mark um all the word fragments for you, and uh, you know, and I know from experience, at some point you also get negligent, you just click okay okay okay, you know, that's not a mistake, and then you might miss a real error. So it doesn't make any sense. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. But see is a actual full word, shouldn't it there b shouldn't there be a space between see and the hyphen? You know, not to be not to be pedantic. After the no, the the C_ and the hyphen, shouldn't there be a space? Okay. Yeah. Um the would and w No. But sometimes it's really difficult, sometimes you really don't know whether they're saying will or would. Yeah, he it it's his yeah. But if if it's not clear, do I just pick uh do you just pick the more grammatic alternative? Or B yeah. But if it but if it's really not absolutely not clear, when they say instea you know, some people when they swallow up the the last bit. Or do we just then transcribe? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. The um should be capitalised. Yeah. Okay. Oh, okay. No. Yeah. Yeah. Um okay, so what about if a whole utterance is uttered while laughing? Do you put the laughter in front? Or in what I usu when that happens what I do is I put laughter in front, then the whole sentence and laughter in, you know, at the end as well. So Yeah. No, but it's it's laughter th throughout. Yeah. There's some people laughing themselves silly at absolutely nothing while while they speak. Mm-hmm. Because in the ICSI dialogues um they always say, you know, while laughing, and we don't do that. So They say either so there it's really not ambiguous whether it's just laugh followed by an a normally spoken utterance or whether it's an utterance spoken while laughing. I think there is a distinction there and we don't have that. Yeah. 'Kay. Morse code. Morse. Yeah. But then I w but then I wouldn't put an asterisk on it. I thought asterisk is something where um it's c it's pronounced as a totally different word, like evaluation and evolution. No? Okay. Oh. Yeah, cause I this is a very frequent mistake that no native speakers make, to say circuit instead of circuit. Mm. Mm. Is push buttons two words? I used one word. Okay. Well it could be she would or should as well. Yeah. Mm. I haven't either. It's just too silly. I'm just thinking of uh you know an utterance consisting entirely of laughter and then putting like punctuation in, like. Sorry. Yeah, because it was it was really just silence and you're asking the person to just get rid of. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Just to make sense of a sentence. What does cutest spelling mean? Oh, okay. Okay. Oh. Well, if you were Cockney, then Sorry. A_ or Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, with some people it actually leads to some really screeching noises, because they're so loud or probably the mic is so close. I had this one um in one of the first dialogues I did, the g this guy called Ed, you could uh always see the waveform actually, you know, being just hitting um the b the boundaries on on both ends and just being at some points just black segments. And when he was talking there was this whole, like you know when you speak to close to a microphone, and that was really horrible. The rest. Hmm. Mister Ed. Oh, I had one guy, one of the project managers was um he had a really weird accent and he was calling um one guy Mister Ed. His name was Ed, and it took me a whole time to, you find out that it was actually Mister Ed. Or Yeah. No, but that it wasn't one word, that it wasn't like some proper name starting with M_. Yeah. Well, but don't you guys have um have this data? Know the people na people's names, like when you Collect the data, th aren't people filling out a form or something? Okay. Yeah. No, but it's information that we theoretically have. Mm. We didn't sign one. Mm-hmm. Mister just to Yeah. No, M_ Mi U_S_ Mi Missus, the Missus. What if somebody calls themselves Ms? I mean it's not not that it ever happened, but yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so even if we know what that word means we're not supposed to right. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause I have there is one dialogue where I think two speakers are French, like one is definitely French, and I know she is saying and then somebody s saying something to her and she goes comment and then you know you know that, so yeah.. Oh, not really, but on comment, yeah. Ok No. Okay. No. Their own. Probably. Yeah, I can hear the chairs moving and the Yeah. Oh, the white-board marker has a camera as well. M_. No well apostrophe and then K_ A_ Y_. That marker smells really bad. It probably became addicted to the fumes. Over a minute. Mm-hmm. Okay. So if something is a minute and three seconds I can still have it, right? Mm-hmm. Um if you just click on one of the arrows. Um in in the resolution thingy, um it will Yeah, on this one. No, not not the other one, this one. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, and you can also if you go to signal and Um that's it's something under signal, where you can adjust the amplitude as well, on resolution. Um Then you can also wait. No, I think that's not if you go to control panel. Signal control panel. No no, signal, control pan Um the vertical zoom, you can adjust that as well, so if it seems too flat for you or you can't really Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Well, I don't know about I know about this for the summarisation, I haven't done this with uh transcription yet. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um I've got a three month contract, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Excuse me. Yeah, I haven't gotten paid for the first two weeks, 'cause um I w I only have a three month contract starting February, but I started mid-January. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Alright. Is your husband now a stay-at-home-dad? He's sleeping through. Yeah.",EN2004a
"So if you've um if you're back to a page, then you tick it again to leave it for the second time. I don't believe all this stuff. It's just amazing. Mm-hmm. Right. Fine. Yep. And um you're gonna was it your idea to stick the bit in it where you say um uh, you know, you're we're inviting like from quite a wide audience we give priority to linguists? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Is it was that a volunteering yeah, or great. Yeah. And that should kinda take care of itself as well. If she just sends one round around to everyone, then only the psycho-linguists will say what was for me. Mm. I mean 'cause I can't imagine there'd be an essential difference really between the Right, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Well do we have um a d an idea of how many people were gonna actually have at the whole thing? Any kind of because then it because seems to me it could be quite obvious. Then we just subtract the number of second and third year students and then everything else is just I'd I would favour doing it just on a first come first serve basis. But I mean if we're like so, mean, we were gonna do this thing for um I can't even remember, was it two or three days? Okay. And so how many how many posters and talks are we gonna actually gonna get in? Mm-hmm. If you do two in a row then that's an hour, isn't it? Um and then give it a twenty minute break perhaps. Or Would we get that many people wanting to give talks? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. How many second and third year um students are there? Right, okay. No. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. We're also gonna be having posters, aren't we. And I should imagine that most people would rather do a poster than give a talk. Uh yeah. But w wouldn't we want to actually just like dedicate an afternoon or a morning to being a poster session? Mm. Yeah yeah yeah. But um people kinda like generally sort of sort them out themsel that sort that out themselves. Um I mean it's the thing about posters, unless you kind of say, you know, if your name is in the first half of the alphabet you can move and the other ones can't. I'd make it a whole morning or a whole afternoon. I mean the ju just because like ones that I've been to as well, um people tend to kinda come and go from them. Um I don't know, I mean I I I'd say a whole either a whole morning or a whole afternoon um at least. But that's just ju I mean just based on the ones that I've been to. Mm-hmm. At least six. Oh right. Okay, yeah, yeah. Um well that's just kind of dictated by the size of the room really, isn't it? Yeah. I mean would we have poster boards or is it just gonna be posters on the walls? They did it like um I ha I should have found this out. Are you guys second years or first years? You're both first year. So n so none of us have been to this before. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think so. Oh you mean um uh w on the October thing? I thought uh well, it seemed to me that he was saying that everyone would do it ju because its goal was to give the new in-take uh idea of Oh no no no no yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Um well we should find out if um generally they use poster boards, if there are some poster boards that we can get ahold of, then that's alright. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Well the maximum. I mean I guess that that will evolve uh when we get a response from people, perhaps. But that's fine, isn't it? So we've got three days. Mm-hmm. And is the the other main group then um philosophy? Oh yeah. Mm. Mm. Philosophy. And do you think inf Informatics would Mm. I mean I'm thinking that the Informatics potentially is quite a big response. Um Oh right, cool. Um Would we wanna ask them and put some kind of like provisor in to make it um specific to sort of preemptively um weed out the numbers or should we just say to them oh, you know, we're having this thing about language and, you know, if you got something you think about language, come to Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, let's just do that. That's seems most straight-forward. Yeah, just So so if you just send them a general thing saying the Linguistics Department's having this conference and would like to invite post-graduates from the Informatics. I'll do that. That's fine. And should I get in touch with Philosophy as well? No one will understand. Yeah. I mean no, you if I just send them a thing saying the Linguistics Department is is having um a postgraduate thing, so if you're a Philosophy student with um you know, and your work has got an interest in language, then Basically what I was thinking was um just sending them your call for papers and ch changing it slightly to say dear Philosophy students. Mm mm. Mm-hmm. Oh I see, right, he wants them there because he so he can make it. Okay. Yeah. Mm, yeah, and I think Yeah yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. What kinds of things do you think people are actually gonna need? Like Mm-hmm. I mean if we do it uh th hasn't B_ nine got all of that? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm. Mm-hmm. You're gonna send that pan pen crazy. Mm-hmm. Why not just give them a week to do the abstract? I mean I'm just thinking about um Oh no no no, I was s I was saying ju just give them a bit longer to get back with the title. Say get back with the title by the seventh. Or do we need ten days to go from Yeah. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. And we've got they we've got an email address for them to send all this to, haven't we? Or what was it? Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm, cool. Oh right, yeah. Oh, so am I. Is it five t is it almost two? Oh, my microphone fell off. Yeah. Yeah. Uh I mean that's just um Yeah, and uh that that would be cool. Okay, so um I mean I won't get in touch with Philosophy. Or I won't send anything to Philosophy and Informatics till I've got your email. 'Cause I'll just tell 'em a modified version of that. But I'll try and get a good address to send it to. Alright. So that was a note. And I'm okay. Alright, we're finished.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, right. Where should we start? What have we got? Mm-hmm. Yeah, right. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. I thi separate course is good idea. That's Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Yeah. Yeah, when in doubt. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right. But the the text for the actual call, is she going to re-work something or uh she should Mm-hmm. I think she might be glad to see kinda there linguistics to adapt. That's always quite helpful. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Ab Not certain anyway. They know her. That's that thing. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I don't think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I w well let's send out the call as soon as possible, see what reactions we get. And then See if we have to put on some restraints. Let's see. Mm. Up to three, but don't exaggerate, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I'm thinking if we go for say I'm thinking uh slots of one and a half hour each. So three lectures each, that would be uh three per day times three will be twenty seven. Mm-hmm. Once in the morning, twice in the afternoon. Yeah. I mean or twice in the morning once in the afternoon. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was about to say, poster session is a good idea because just the people presenting the posters are there and can say something about it. Actually there's always the problem again then the people who are presenting the posters don't get around to go and look at others' posters. But let's see about that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Do we have any information on this? First years. Oh. Actually, we have a message here from Mits about the poster session. Poster session was introduced in nineteen ninety nine as part of the main conference. In two thousand it was held separately in October. The intention was to use it as a way to introduce incoming post-grad students to the department's research culture. However, I did not pursue this idea the following year because the comments I received from students in two thousand were generally discouraging. On the other hand, I later learned that some students did find the October poster session quite a useful experience. My suggestion therefore is to re-examine the idea of poster session altogether and find a better way to implement it if there seems to be enough interest in it. Mm. Yeah. Last sentence. One possibility is to put it back in the main conference and let people choose between a paper presentation and a poster. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. But a poster I might do. Mm-hmm. All these dead linguists. Mm-hmm. Um write into the call that we are considering the idea of having a poster session. So people can indicate would they prefer to give a poster or a talk. But the ultimate decision is on our side because we have to see how it does it work out with the poster session, how does it work out with the talks. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yep. Just throw a general suggestion at them. See what happens. I think they do. Still Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, might be interesting stuff coming in. Read something recently about I think somebody's Masters project to look in how far English is actu uh or in how far English is a shaping influence on programming languages. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of Yeah. Or some some relevance clause. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Kind of a relevance clause. Mm-hmm. Adjust. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think that's So far it's just a general statement of interest, what we intend to do. What we actually get to do we'll see later when we have the stuff. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Two weeks ahead of End of March. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I will be away probably until Easter. So this actually means we have the week directly after Easter between my coming back and you leaving to get the stuff done. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. In my experience what you usually should have is some kind of um, what's it, over-head thingo um beamer. In some cases we might if it's really tough, we might be in need of a of some sound system to play recordings. Should be there, yeah. Adjusting. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Nah. No way anymore. Mm neither do I. Mm-hmm. I could create us another calendar. For the title deadline? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Uh f I think if they're really serious to be a bit late with the title might not be bad, because it will help them to Yeah. Yep. Yep. Getting access to the uh to the account. Blah blah blah blah. Yeah. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. We've got it all written down. Should I take care of the web page? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. No. Not quite, but almost. Yeah. Um Mm-hmm. I think latest s soon as the call is out. Because then we have the call thing, we have that away and look at the boar organisatorial stuff like uh Do we know about chairs, tea, and stuff? Okay.

Can you just remind me, I don't have to tick the no n okay thing until I finish writing, but it's only if I go back to it I tick okay again. Mm. Yep. So if I'm working o if I've done a page, I'm on the second page, I tick it so um I finish that page and I go back to this, I can just write and then not tick until I finish writing again. Yeah, so it's always after, n you never have to it before. Fine. Fine. And you can go on both sides as well. Okay. Well, I think the first thing is Well, the first thing I think is we need to uh sort out the call for abstracts or the c the call for titles, because I think that's kind of overdue. Yeah? Um so I volunteer to do that if you like. Um uh okay. So And I'll do that by Trying to think, what is it Thursday today, I'll d I'll do that by the end of the week anyway. So Yeah, we're gonna do that, but I think we should s probably send out um separate calls, okay. So we'll send one, but weren't men I mean we could mention the fact that we're inviting other people, but I think it will probably just uh I mean it probably won't matter too much to the other linguists that we're having other people there. We can mention it, but it's not gonna be too essential and uh we might actually just end up making them worry that, you know, they're gonna lose their place or whatever, because uh I don't know. But we do we do have to decide a priority thing, so that's something else we can look at um a little bit later down the line. So so that's the one for ling basically and I'll send that out. I'll do that today or tomorrow. Um now Claire, that's the other thing, she can deal with the Psychology. Um Psychology people, probably that's I reckon it's the best thing to do. 'Cause she'll know which email address to use and and everything else. So um if one of us could email Claire. Okay, yeah, so if Robert So i if Robert emails Claire and we're n gonna need to decide exactly what she's gonna say on there. Um we might need to just remind her of the dates in case she doesn't know, so she gets the dates right. Um And uh um she's I know she already knows that it's just anyone doing psycho-linguistics basically. So that's fine. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Um But then there's the rest of P_P_L_S_ and I think we need to decide whether I think she should just I think she should just write her own. Probably. And Okay. So what we'll do I mean the thing is the the main call will go out before she's got round to it anyway. So what I'll do is I'll copy it. I'll C_C_ her on the um No, they won't be. I just th the only thing I'm thinking is I want to make sure that it stands out as something applicable to them, that they don't go oh, we're just getting rubbish from y you know what I mean. I want them to really know that it's addressed to them. Um and the good thing about Claire sending it is she's probably got a psych email address as well and it it might look a bit more relevant to them. Yeah, exactly. They know her, et cetera. Um so yeah, so if if we've s if I've C_C_ed the original one, then you can tell her that that can be the basis for um the basis for her email, but just make sure that they know it's relevant to them, et cetera.. Um and obviously in P_P_L_S_ we've also got English language. Now in a way we could send out that first call to them, just as part of the same email, because I think they're more likely to think it was relevant to them. I don't really know. I don't really know what you think about that. But um I think we definitely should open it up to English language. Um I think particularly at the moment, 'cause they're really trying to sort of uh merge us into one subject area, even though it should be meaningless, because we're all part of a school, I think that it does actually make a difference. And so I think we should invite them, but then we've still got the problem of uh a priority issue. So, you know, probably what I was thinking is um certainly second and third-years absolutely need to be uh top on top priority. But then there's a kind of awkward question of where we put first-years, because they don't need to. If they want to, should they have priority? This is a kind of lower point but uh it kind of it crosses over with deciding what we're gonna do when we uh Well Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. It's three days. Right. The uh uh they were twenty twenty minute talks with ten minute uh question time, okay. And you can run two in a row, but probably not up to three. Two what do you think, two in a row or three in a row? Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean the thing is every time we have a break, there's a question of whether we actually serve coffee and biscuits and things, because that's the kinda normal thing to do. So are you saying have, say, three sessions in a row and then do that twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon? So that'd be six hours. Oh, so just have an hour and a half in the morning. 'Cause I mean would six hours a day be pushing it? Not necessarily, because I mean the good think is n Well I suppose what we can do is think about the structure now and say right, what's the maximum we can do? So I think that's about as much as we could do, to have an hour and a half, then have a coffee break, then have an hour and a half, then have lunch, hour and a half, coffee break, hour and a half. And so that would be eighteen hours of talks overall, wouldn't it? But what do we say? So it's th so it's twelve thirty six talks, is that right? Maximum thirty six. Um Okay, let's just put this down. Uh Well I could look 'cause I I've got that there's the list, isn't there, of post-graduates I maintain in in linguistics. Um there are probably about thirty on there. Um but a good number of them are first-years, and I don't know I mean just to get an idea, are you planning on talking? No. Are you planning, Robert? And I'm probably not. So there's a good chance that almost none of the first-years are gonna volunteer. Um so if we had say twenty linguistics and even then, I mean there are quite a few people who are abroad and who won't bother to turn up or can't make it or whatever. So, you know, it might be that we only get say fifteen anyway, and then we could be left with uh fifteen blocks for um the rest of P_P_L_S_. So at least we know that that we've got an absolute limit of about thirty-six talks, yeah? Um Yeah. Okay. And that's that's what uh the coffee breaks will be for, and maybe lunchtimes. But coffee breaks are probably more like ab or are gonna be a better time, because people will hang around, whereas people are more likely to go off somewhere for lunch, aren't they? Okay. Mm. So uh how long should a poster session be? Like how long will people want to mill around for looking at Okay. So that means we could have thirty talks. Plus uh one A_M_ or P_M_ of posters. Yeah? And we could probably get quite a few in there, at least six anyway. At least six posters, if you see what I mean. During the session, like how many can you have going on at once? Wall space and First years. No. I've been to Durham uh post-graduate conference and I mean every conference I've ever been to, the posters have always been in the coffee break, which is why probably, because normally they're limited on space and they Yeah. Well, I think keeping it um along-side the conference is possibly one way of maintaining interest and And uh Yeah, I think that's definitely the idea, I think the best idea. I can imagine it would seem a bit random just have like a poster session and bes uh yeah, just have a p a poster session um What would it be at the beginning? So I suppose it is it normally uh second years do it like just after they've come back for the s The That's what it would be, I think. It Yeah, but I d I don't think he means that it would be the first-years who've only just arrived would do a poster. That would be a bit odd, wouldn't it? Okay, so at least anyone who's feeling yeah, exactly. Yeah, I I might do, I d I still th I'm little bit doubtful. But um so that's good anyway. So we've got an idea. I think there's thirty talks and and say six, ten posters, whatever we can manage to fit in the room. Um so we need to look at we need to look at where we're gonna ho hold it. We could have it in B_ nine, but there's things all over the wall. There are those pictures that run all the way around, so can we take the pictures down? Can we use B_ nine for the posters for instance? Okay, so poster boards. And wha uh um what I'll do, I'll email Mits about that, okay? Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Okay. Well what we'll do is sa we can just say uh if you want to do a talk, then just say so, and if you want to do a poster, then say you want to do a poster. And we can sort of base it around that. And if we get absolutely tons of people wanting to do posters and we don't think there's a you know, everyone's kind of done it as a cop-out, then we might have to sort of say to them well, you know, would you consider doing a talk instead, because uh particularly the second and third-years, because we need more talks, and just, you know, do it like that. Um we could even say something like um you know, first-years might want to give a poster or something like that because I don't know, maybe that's a bad idea, but Yeah. Okay. Okay, so we got some sort of idea of the structure and how many talks we're going to be able to have. I mean w Yeah. Okay. So I've uh Okay, so English language um we'll put on the main call, and I'll just I I'll just kinda market it as an linguistics and English language or something like that, I think. Yes, and Informatics, we could think about it as well. So I had a look at whether they do philosophy of a language and logic and stuff here, and they kind of do. There's about there's about three or four uh full-time members of staff that list um philosophy of language as a major interest, so chances are they're gonna have some P_H_D_ students that uh are interested. So do we think we should invite them? I think I'd be surprised if we got sort of four out of them. I think that would be amazing if we did. So I think it's probably worth I don't think we're gonna get inundated with requests. So I think it's worth asking them. Yeah. I mean I think the Informatics are definitely worth asking. Uh th there's there's C_S_T_R_ and um H_C_R_C_. Yes. It is. Yeah, it is. It Yeah, well it would be nice to that. It would be nice it would be nice to do it. The thing is we can't afford to bias it towards any particular kind of linguistics in a sense, because it's such a Because of the way our department is, then we're supposed to sort of embrace all kinds. In fact, even by inviting um people from um Informatics and from or maybe from Philosophy and things, it might bias it in a particular direction. But I don't know, it's probably not too bad. I I think that I think that between Philosophy, Informatics and um Psychology you've probably got quite a lot of breadth there anyway. Um the thing is uh the one thing is the only kind of people doing anything like applied linguistics are the applied linguists themselves and people in sociology with an interest in language. And I don't think we'd be inviting them. But I don't think that's too bad, because the first thing is there's a good reason for inviting everyone in P_P_L_S_, because we are in one school. And then the fact that we also invite people from the Informatics, I suppose it's just that we do have pretty strong ties with them, and I don't think anyone would be too offended. I hope not anyway. Um so yeah. So what kind of provisor can we put on? I mean we could we could just say outright anyone in their third year or anyone in their second or third year. But I don't know. Or we can just, you know, t uh take whatever we get and pick the best between us, which is Y yeah. Yeah. So So you're going to email Claire. Um so who wants to send something out to Informatics? Yeah? Alright. Yeah, sure. Um so Yeah, so what you want to say is anyone who wants to give a talk on logic or philosophy of language, um but put a warning that if it's logic, then there's a good chance that no one will understand, or not that many. I mean maybe just maybe if you just put Yeah, just put philosophy of language. That's that's probably good. Or just or any ph Yep. Yeah, that's it. That's what you do. Yeah, that I think that's as much as we need to say. That's right. So uh you've gotta work out how to do that and who to email. Mm. Yeah, that's fine, that's fine. That's what you wanna do. Um as long as it's clear from the subject bar that it's relevant to them and that it says somewhere that for Philosophy students with an interest in language and and that's it. And then between us we'll have to have another meeting and and I mean at the same time as we're sorting through all the other titles and and deciding um how to divide up the sessions. See someone suggested to me that it's actually better to have talks on a similar topic spread out as much as possible, which to me just seemed absolutely crazy. And the reason she gave me was something to do with uh taking out like a whole day or a whole afternoon would be quite difficult, but I think that balance against the fact that most people want to be able to say well look, I can have just this one day off, as opposed to when I'll need an hour over three da you know, an hour each day for three days. It you can end up having to take three afternoons or three mornings or whatever off. So I think in general, and also for the sake of the lecturers Uh I think a lot of the time Simon Kirby has already said to me that anyone any of his students he wants to be on the first day, on the Wednesday, right, and that's because I shifted it I basically had it on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday to begin with, and then eve it moved down twice to Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So Wednesday is the only day left that he can make. So Yeah. So and the other thing is um when we get some calls say we have uh for instance three people supervised by Bob Ladd, then it might be that then we are gonna have to uh contact Bob and say Bob, these three of your students are gonna be talking. Um presu presumably you want to be there. So can you give us a time that would be good for you? And then we can put them in a block at one time. 'Cause he says yeah, okay, Thursday afternoon I've got completely free. So I think we do need to stick everyone together, uh particularly if they've got the same supervisor. And it's also good if talks are on the same topic for a whole morning or a whole afternoon because then people will come along and go oh, this morning it's all on phonology or this morning it's all on applied linguistics. And then Okay? As much as possible anyway. Yeah. Now we need if I'm gonna send out this call, uh we need a deadline for titles. So Um what should we say? Something like 'cause we need a deadline for titles and a deadline for abstracts. So let's set the the latest deadline, the the uh the the sort of abstracts deadline first because we need to have a meeting, and that's gonna be when all the real work starts. So what's the absolute latest? I was think I mean maybe the end of End of March might be okay. Uh I'm going away for two weeks on the fourth of April. And then I'm coming back just in time for the conference. So any organising, at least stuff where I need to be where we need to meet physically has to be done before that. I tell you one thing. Uh it's starting on the Wednesday, and the first day back is Tuesday. I think I'm coming back I'm trying to get this right. Hopefully I'll be back in time that we'll be able to do something the day before. 'Cause I think I'm gonna be back. Might even have to come in in the evening. But that's not the end of the world, but we might have to set some things up. Like maybe just get the chairs organised or whatever. We might actually have to go into the rooms and get things ready. And there's gonna be other things like getting the technology ready. So not only is there a pressure to have uh talks that are on a similar topic together, but also if people need the same kind of computer set-up, it's good to have them together so we don't have to keep changing it. So Because I th I think it was Cedric has already offered to do whatever we need him to do. But he just needs to know in advance what people need so that he can be there and and get it ready for them. So I think when people Well, hopefully most people will d either have something like PowerPoint or they'll just have uh P_D_F_ slides or something. Hopefully, no one will have anything too specialized. S sh z Yeah. Yeah, it's got a lot in there. But I think it does take a little bit of I mean uh I think sometimes maybe people need to be in Linux rather than Windows and so booting in and out m is sometimes an issue I think. Um But I think what we should say is when I put out this call, I'll put both deadlines, and I think I'll say that when you send in your abstract, you need to mention that any technology you intend to use, so that at least if we have all the information Yeah? So um so deadlines. Um, okay so let's think about this. If if we gave them a whole month or just over a month, then that would be okay, wouldn't it, because we've still got Oh no, it wouldn't be okay at all. If we gave them the whole month, that'd give us hardly any time. So if we gave them say till mid-March, that would be good. So give them something like give them something like ten days or whatever to get the title in, and then give them a week on top of that to get the actual abstract done. And the abstract doesn't have to be much, it's probably only half a side of A_ four or something, isn't it? Just enough that we can see whether it's interesting or what kind of area it fits into. That's all we really need. Um see ideal ideally I would've liked to have given them a bit longer. But I think w That will be okay. Okay. So unfortunately I don't have a calendar. Um so let's just That's true. No, it's I think it's okay when you're not writing on there. Um so So Uh Thirty one oh no, it's twenty eight this this month, isn't it? Two, three, four. So if we have it like a Monday, Monday the fourteenth'd probably be quite good for the final deadline. And then um if I send it out tomorrow, we'll say something like the el Or maybe the fourth would be good. So give them a w yeah, a week for the title, and then they would have about ten days from then to actually get the abstract in. Does that sound reasonable? Just put it here, yeah? The eleventh. A bit earlier. So I'm saying a week from when I send it out That would be a week anyway. That would be a week anyway, but you can give them ten days to you can give them ten days to get the title, or you can give them it depends which way around you wanna do it. So what's gonna take them longer actually to decide what they're gonna do and send the title, or is it gonna be on the basis of the title, do they want more time to write the abstract. So give them the seventh, yeah? Okay, so So Monday the seventh is the title. And this presumably will apply across the board. Like um And Monday the fourteenth for the abstract. Well we we kind of have. I d uh we were given The only thing is acce is accessing the account. They can send it to P_G_C_ at ling as long as we can get the Wh I'll tell you what I'll do then, I'll go and see Mike th today and and get the password and everything. 'Cause we possibly have it, but I'll just sort that out with him. Because if we're gonna tell everyone to email P_G_C_, then we have to make pretty sure that we can actually access the account and that it's operational and stuff. 'Cause uh so far I've just been using my own uh email address. But it would be better it's quite easy to send f from an email address. 'Cause you can send from any email address you like. It's just the fact that you need to p uh it's just the fact that when they reply to it, you need to be able to uh access it. So I already tried it once, and I'm sure they gave us a password. And I even I even actu Oh well, that's it then. No problem. That's it. So does i I mean it You may already know, but the thing is if you want to send this call for abstracts, you know, when you do the philosophy and and thingy one, then if you want to send from P_G_C_, then uh I mean you might already know, but you can go f if if you did it from web-mail, you can just create a new account for yourself and where it sa it actually has a send from address, and you can just put P_G_C_ at ling dot and just do it that way. Uh or depending on your normal email client, you might be able to do it, but it doesn't matter too much. The the the other thing you could do is have is just fill in the reply to address as P_G_C_, depending on what you wanna do. But that's what I'll do. I'll send it from P_G_C_, so if anyone replies, it would just go to that account and any of us can access it at any time. Presumably, you can access from web-mail or, you know, or I_ MAP or whatever. Yeah, if you want to to create a web page and just copy my email into it or something, and anything else you might wanna do, and then later on we can put the uh the programme in. So um Okay? It's not quite it's p two or three minutes to. You you got something for two, haven't you? Right. Okay. So very quickly then, can we arrange a new time to have a meeting? Do you think we need to how long do you think until we need to meet again? Have we got enough to be getting on with. We probably have, haven't we? So I mean maybe m I mean ideally I suppose we'll meet again here. So we can with Melissa and we'll just send out an email. Okay? Yep. That's fine. Yep.",EN2003a
"Yeah, mm-hmm. Hmm. Thank you. No, I don't think so. I d Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yes. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Meeting action. Mm. They just mention that they want decision um for issues, action items. I think they are more talking about um user requirement for the meeting than soft text, they want to know what happened happening in a meeting. they say that? Hmm. Mm-hmm.. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Contact. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um right now d uh I'm doing I'm trying to do the uh meeting action segmentation. J because uh after talking to Jane um just uh we have different ideas whether uh meeting action will be about the same size as topic segments. So um it would be good to um t right now I'm doing this, um looking at the data and trying to see if I can do the meeting action segmentation first and the scheme, and then do topic segmentation again to see if the boundary actually coincide with each other. Yeah, if if that that do, then maybe we can talk again whether um i it it make sense. Mm-hmm. Alright, yeah. Um I have just started. And um so far um I s think uh it's uh it I think it it's a still um about the s about the same level of segmentation we're talking here. But uh maybe the boundary will not be exactly the same. But uh that that the segment Mm-hmm, right, sure. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm, sure. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. I want to see. Something. Sure. Mm-hmm.
Alright, is it it's ready. Okay, great. Yeah, everything's okay. Okay. Okay, okay, yeah. Okay, thanks. Okay. Okay, thanks. Yeah. Yeah, yeah a very or a quick uh slides. So um I've been here for fourteen month, I think. Yeah, so I've a accustomed to the environment here and enjoy staying here. So mm uh from uh last year I was uh uh s uh supervising the annotation of segmentation, summarisation uh uh with Jean uh of the I uh IC ICSI corpus and uh uh uh on the other hand uh I w n uh did s some very preliminary work on chunking the switchboard corpus. But uh that was not uh well picked up in the AMI corpus, which is supposed to be. So uh and currently I'm more interested in see uh uh, yeah, analysing the discourse structure in multi-party meetings. This is what I'm going to present here. So uh uh in this presentation I'm going to see how we could analyse utterance to utterance relations in multi-party meetings. Um 'Cause meetings is a lit different from normal text or a n a normal dialogue or monologue. So interactivity is a concept is a concept that I'm using to distinguish the two uh uh extremes of uh of interac uh of discourse in meetings. And uh for dialogues uh and monologues I think we might have to use different uh concepts to m m uh model the discourse structure. Then uh I w I will uh give a very uh rough plan for the next uh couple of month. And finally I I will intr i introduce some related work, yeah. So the big question that I'm concern here is what's the relationship between utterances in multi-party meetings, or how do we analyse discourse structure right above utterances instead of uh those high level intentional structure of discourse? So the concern here is about the very local low level utterance-to-utterance relations in multi-party meetings. Uh this is the local discourse structure. So the uh building block of that kind of uh structure would be the uh utterance and possibly one of its properties, the dialogue act which we're currently uh working on or uh and uh for meetings, yeah, so I've mentioned uh uh before that meetings is a bit different from uh monologue and uh dialogues. So uh in meetings I uh from my uh reading of the one of the AMI meetings I_S_ one O_ eight, uh the uh the four meetings, I noticed that uh uh the interaction, degrees of interaction in the meetings uh varies from parts to parts. So for some part uh the interaction is very strong. So it's obviously a dialogue. But uh for some part part where the interaction is very weak, uh just uh like the uh chairman or project manager is mm uh coordinating the meeting. He's uh pushing the meeting forward, then this kind of s organ organisational structure or part. Uh uh and also other pr uh parts like uh the back-channels without any uh semantic content uh from other participants. So this kind of uh interaction might be better analysed as monologue, which uh in which there is interaction, I suppose. So Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, so this is going to be based on the utterance to utterance. So for this utterance, the next utterance, if it's from another pa uh speaker, then uh if it's not a back-channel or uh something similar, then it's a dialogue. So if speak changes. So yeah, speaker change is Yeah. Yeah, yeah, b but uh sh short uh turns uh like mm or something very similar might be the uh seg second type of interactivity, the weak interactivity. That might not be analysed as a uh monologue, but as a dial uh no no no, wrong, uh not as dialogue but as um a monologue. Yeah. So for that part uh for that kind of back-channels we can just skip that and uh uh to not treat them as interruptions or something like. Then yeah, we could just uh Yeah. Yeah. Speak change speak change would be yeah. If if it's uh just some kind of back-channel or it's just a signal signal the s the speaker is listening or is understanding what's going on, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Um Yeah, so Uh yeah. Uh so for interactivity this is the only slide. So yeah activity is uh I'd define interactivity to be as a degrees of interaction in meetings. So which might uh speak change whi uh uh would be a very good indicator, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah yeah. No, no. Yeah. No yeah. So actually, so uh this is a very rough idea of interactivity. If we go further, we might distinguish uh the interactivity between two, f three, or all the groups. So that might be some final definition for the uh interactivity, yeah. Yeah, so that might be the second class, yeah. Weak this is a kind of weak interactivity. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's also true. Yeah. S yeah, yeah, actually 'cause uh I've looked uh Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. So for that case, yeah uh yeah, so this might be a weak definition of interactivity. So if we could figure out uh if they are really interacti uh interacting with each other, or just uh uh incremental mm presentation of some information. So that's d uh different. We might um yeah need a more strict or finer uh definition of interactivity. Yeah, ju uh for this use of the uh for the use of this term for the indicator of the uh degrees of interaction, uh I think for for the current uh proposal I think that it's just for distinguish between dialogues and monologues. 'Cause for these two types of discourse, uh the uh the the cons the the two that we are going to analyse the discourse structure might be d different. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. And also 'cause uh I have uh read some of the M_O_T_A_ uh corpus. Uh so for some part of th that kind of meetings um uh several utterances or dialogue acts are just uh tagged as statement. So that I don't think that would be very informative for high level str analysis. So that's all what uh that's why why uh I'm distinguishing the two kinds of discourse here. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, the like yeah. Yesterday, yeah. Mm-hmm. Might be a Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, just a uh turn exchange, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Actually sh uh she used some a a a bunch of features to do the automatic parsing. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh yeah. Utterance to utterance, yeah. Very low level, yeah. You cou yeah. Yeah, i to uh just we need to see uh how well we could work out of the utterance to utterance. Yeah. Yeah. So uh yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No. Hmm, hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, for interactivity this is a very weak definition, yeah. If we need more then we might use some more finer uh f finer uh definition for interactivity. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. So mm so for dialogue, yeah, mm there would be uh some kind of uh interaction structure. So it for uh in previous discourse studies, uh especially in discourse analysis exchange uh is used to describe this kind of uh local structure. And in conversation the analysis so adjacency pairs are used to describe this kind of structure. Uh but uh in these two strands or work they uh just come up with a list, maybe not uh exhaustive. So uh I'm been think about uh if we could come up with some kind of more principal scheme uh taking some of the uh information in the uh uh uh in the uh interaction uh into account. Like uh is the small part of interaction is is exchanging some information. Uh here information is a little vague. It could be some kind of knowledge what the uh speaker knows or or some kind of thought what the speaker is thinking. So these two kind of uh inform mm two kinds of the information uh might be some kind of a difference. So this is a little bit like the Bell's mm exchange of information uh for the knowledge. If exchange of uh opinion uh uh some kind of so it's uh very related to thought, of thinking, yeah. Uh in some case it s differs 'cause uh when we exchange knowledge, we might not challenge uh the speaker, but uh when the speaker is uh pre uh is uh talk about what he feels, what he thinks, is proposing something or s uh then other speakers might might chan challenge him or her. So that kind of structu Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But uh that might b be some difference inter interaction par patterns. Might be. 'Cause uh for information if we uh somebody's uh seeking some information, then he uh ask some question and uh the one knows will uh gives gives the answer. But uh uh for the uh opinion or thought uh stuff, then the speaker might just uh uh present some idea and others will comment or uh challenge uh the idea. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it's vague, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm see 'cause uh so far I'm s still looking for a uh so-called principal scheme for the interaction uh for the interaction. So Yeah, so Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so yeah, for uh p uh the discourse analysis they're using exchange, but uh they have no uh no classification just to come up with okay, so uh you mean uh uh Sinclair and Coulthard. That is. Also at Geneva school they I don't think they list some kind of exchange. But uh the uh exchange structure uh and uh yeah, exchange is first uh developed in uh systemic functional grammar along the uh uh Halliday and and Martin's work. Yeah. So uh actually they they have some something in in a textbook about the exchange. Uh they call it negotiation. So they have uh some flow charts of the uh uh detailed analysis of uh uh exchange structure, yeah. Yeah. So um uh I don't think there is any kind of principle classification of exchanges. This is i yeah, w Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Yeah, I_R_F_ uh kind of structure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Mm 'cause uh from my previous experience we see ananys analysis of information seeking dialogues over telephones. So it's um uh about the tourism information. So from uh um my analysis of that kind of dialogues I could say that there's only there only four basic uh exchanges depend on the information uh direction of the information flow, and also the speaker role. 'Cause in the information seeking dialogues the uh t roles of the two participants are different. One is mainly the uh from the uh agency, a tourism agency. That is main uh uh information provider uh while the customer is the information seeker mainly. Yeah, that's uh so theref uh and also mm uh the direction of information flows for some kind of information, like uh the uh uh price of a specific route, uh the spots they're going to uh visit, and also on the uh kinds of uh ve uh vehicle or or transportation, yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah yeah, s yeah, yeah. So but there also some variations which I call complex exchanges. So that's uh that's uh just a list. Mm not like the uh basic exchange uh exchanges, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah yeah, parametri yeah, I I I'm looking for parametric, yeah, scheme. Yeah yeah yeah. That's uh y yeah. A parame parameter or principle. Yeah, some something like. Yeah. Yeah. And also yeah. A and also s in 'cause in the meetings uh the speakers might might report something uh they've done in the past and uh uh uh uh talk about th what they are currently doing and also planning some future actions. So this kind of information might also be helpful. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh not marking. Just uh for my uh reading of the uh I_ I_S_ one O_ eight uh four meeting series. Yeah, just to reading this part, yeah. Mm Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. So this is for the uh dialogue part. For monologues uh this is uh yeah. Okay, so no further uh information is here. Uh Uh Mm 'cause uh so for the information and action the uh the action here is not dialogue act but uh some kind of uh uh physical action uh that uh the uh participant's uh i i is going to uh or has done in the past. He's going to do the future. So Uh not Physical sense, yeah. Physical sense, yeah. Yeah, so uh this kind of might be the uh some kind of semantics of the utterance or or exchange. So uh this is just one um thing I one parameter uh for mm-hmm. Uh I mean uh here the scheme is for exchange scheme. So yeah, for uh for for uh exchange of information. So there might be the uh s speaker, and he uh a hearer. So who speaks to whom and uh uh S so this is the uh uh so direction of the information flow and also so speaker role might be first uh parameters for the uh ex uh information exchanges. So um but for action that might be uh some kind of uh propose or accept or reject kind of uh uh exchange structure, I mean. Uh-huh. Uh no no. No that's uh that's the uh So we're going to do something and uh uh so could you do something or this kind of uh action related utterance I mean. Yeah. Okay, technical sense. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, that's n Hmm. Before come up with the scheme, you mean. Yeah. Exch So yeah. Uh yeah. S Stent yeah Stent might does um yeah. Stent, yeah. Mm no. Uh so so 'cause I'm I might not familiar with these na Mm-hmm. So uh is it the work uh described in the c uh in in uh in the coconut project or something similar? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Y yeah, look uh not very much detail, yeah. Yeah. No, not. Okay. Yeah. Yes, yes. Yeah, I know okay. Oh. Uh I know this guy, yeah, yeah. Uh, Jim @'s student. Yeah, I know. No no, in Saa Saarbruecken. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah yeah yeah. Okay. Yeah, I know, her. Okay. No. Mm-hmm. No. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. So main actions I guess might be some some high level uh problem solving or decision making uh uh concepts, uh not like the exchange which which I I would like to be very low level utterance to utterance relations. Uh I mean uh I mean the m main actions might be some it might be, yeah, built built Okay, so well w Okay. Okay. Okay. Physical. Some kind of physical actions, yeah. Okay. Yeah, different scheme, yeah. So yeah uh th the the main actions that uh you're talk about I think might be, yeah, built up from the exchange, yeah. Ex at least exchange might be uh one kind of uh important information for that kind of Yeah. Yeah, okay. Next. Yeah. So yeah, for the monologue I've I have not uh looked into the details about the this kind of uh relations for the monologue parts. Just a list of these uh relations. And uh so uh next I need to uh review the literature and uh come up with s schemes for the real data annotation. And after that uh we w 'cause this mm is not in the hub corpus. So we are not going to get l all the meetings annotated with that kind of. So uh so we we might ju first try a few meetings and uh have a reliability study. If it's reliable enough, then we must just uh just annotate a small part of the meetings and using some learning techniques to boot boot-strap the uh uh automatic uh analyser. Mm-hmm. Yeah, if uh if it's based on the uh um dialogue acts, yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm Yes. Hmm. Or fits the meeting browser. Yeah. Okay, so mm This might not be the final goal that uh that could be fit into the uh browser. But it uh might be some kind of uh uh information which might benefit meeting actions or some more high level decision making or problem solving. 'Cause this is the building blocks, I guess, yeah. So Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. So after this if uh if uh uh we might do some mm pe uh from here we might be some uh uh, yeah, c problem solving, decision making process to track that kind of information. Yeah. Yeah. Messy. Yeah, yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Ye Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, ma ma uh s Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's kind of uh Yeah, yeah, yeah. Different feature combination, yeah. Yeah, yes. Uh uh yeah. Uh I mean I was supposed to chunk uh some part of the AMI meetings, you know, to see if the chunker channel switchboard works well enough or not. If not, then mm we have to use some kind of semi-superv supervised learning or some uh boot-strapping to to to do the chunking. No, no, 'cause I was a bit worried about uh this kind of uh discourse structure, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh dialogue segmentaton. Yeah, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Or AMI data. N no. Okay. So Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, yeah, for Switchboard, yeah. Direct chunking, 'cause we are not going to in a tree out of the AMI data. Uh so th uh we uh D_F_K_I_, 'cause they're working on some H_P_S_G_ parsing. Yeah, might be. Might be, yeah. If the Uh if uh I'm I guess that if they're different then we might just uh write another script to do the translation. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, yeah. I need to look at some of to see. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Twenty minute, yeah. Yeah? T_N_O_, yeah. Okay. Yeah, 'cause yeah they did some work bio project with the H_P_S_G_ parsing. At least bio. Yeah, well maybe. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No. Okay, okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh not sure c uh Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hmm hmm. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. Yeah, yeah. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Okay. S so then later, yeah? Okay. Okay. Yeah, it's yeah. Okay. Sorry? You mean mm. I will try my best, yeah. Oh yeah. Uh I m I might yeah, 'cause uh Julie and the boy is here. So. it's a little tiring 'cause my parents have left. Uh yeah. So I might take two weeks off two weeks off in uh May, yeah, sometimes, yeah. Off, yeah. Okay, thanks. Uh yeah, hope I hope so very soon. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, thanks.
Aren't they suing him? Mm-hmm. Can't th can't they get legal aid? Hmm. Mm-hmm. Are we supposed to count to ten or something? We don't have to do all that? Okay. Okay. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Okay, so You're gonna give a presentation for us then. Great. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I was just wondering if you were gonna define this more on the slides to come or if this is as much as you're gonna tell us. I'm just wondering if he's prepared Sure. So so what did you have more on later slides about this? Okay. But we've also established that it's not just speaker change, it because if you have mm-hmm, okay, then Okay. Y yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well it might be the case that to be interactive there have to be dialogue acts of some specific type in a turn rather than Like statement, statement, reject, accept, you know, something like that. Mm-hmm. Well, actually I don't quite agree. I mean i for example you can't use R_S_T_ across speakers because the definitions of the relations depend on the intentions of the speaker and there's different speakers have different intentions. So you can't use the theory. It's just fundamentally wrong, it's it was meant as a theory for a one person uh right. So that doesn't mean there aren't other theo so for Yeah. Right, but those are very those are really different um theories that are at are trying to get at different things and it and they admit of m you know, some of them admit of multiple parties and some of them assume you're in one speaker's head. Right, and the Mm-hmm. Yeah, the entire theory is based on intention and the intention of one individual. So R_S_T_ would be a bad theory to use. W So modelling modelling a single contribution by a single speaker, you can within that you can use R_S_T_ if you want to, right. But across speakers you can't. They have no relations for things like reject or agree. They the theory doesn't have them. So the the so it's not the right theory 'cause the theory is the relations plus the notion of nuclearity. So we need a different theory. Now I think Alex um S_D_R_S_ allows both kinds. So you know, within a speaker turn you can have things like explanation and cause and all that. Um but then across speaker turns you can have things like correction or I didn't see any examples of agree or disagree in S_T_R_S_, but I there aren't? I mean there are thirty relations. So we should look at at what they are. But I d I don't Well her the relations have a s D Yes, but so I mean the relation names it's not the names that are important, it's their semantics that are important, right. And they're the semantics of the relations are based on the semantics of the utterances that they're relating as Alex s explained yesterday. Um and so um it is important that these relations have a semantics that's tied to the semantics of the utterances, right. Uh p poss possibly, but few people have tried to, you know, do the kind of um truth conditional semantics that, you know, Asher and Lascarides have done, right. So the theory can handle the kinds of things that happen in meetings, as she explained. The actual computational mechanisms they have currently for building up the trees can't. Now I don't remember, was which speaker you in the c in the example she showed yesterday, was it the case that the representation of the utterances and the relations included which speaker was uh I mean it had the at the l at the leaves they had the well, she didn't show it, but they would have the semantics of the utterances. And then she had relation names and handles. Right. I just I just don't didn't remember seeing in the representation which speaker contributed what. 'Cause she did represent um discourse structures 'cause these were the Verbmobil scheduling dialogues. So the utterances in the in the representation were uttered by two different parties that wasn't the you know, in the in the examples she showed us, there were there was some that was just, you know, one party. It was a monologue, but then there was a snippet of dialogue as well with For this specific set of relations that that they've defined. There might be some higher level structure that you wanna pull out of that. I mean I 'cause you were saying you're just gonna you you're you wanna look at this, you know, very local stuff. But from that you c one would hope you would pull out something high, you know No, I think working from the bottom up sounds great, but I'm just y I mean what you can imagine someone saying well how did they decide to make it blue, and maybe there was a long blow by bl and you don't you kind of wanna abstract away from he said this, she said that, he sai you know, to Anyway, I you know, I mean I I don't think especially uh, you know, if you're not steeped in these theories that it makes a huge difference to you whether we use R_S_T_ or something like S_D_R_S_. But it might make much more, you know, I mean Well I think we should ass I think we should try to find a theory that allows multiple speakers and relations to span over more than one spea you know. Because it is true that I mean if you look at things like damsel and other attempts to come up with annotation schemes for for dialogue acts, there was this notion of forward looking and backward looking. Anyway, they're relational. I mean in some way, you know, they're all relational. Um but you needed But there's a different set of tags in there from the kinds of relations you see within R_S_T_, for example. So if you look at Amanda Stent's thesis and the analysis that she did sort of within a turn she used something like R_S_T_. And then across turns she used damsel, right. Well I Well, it gives you things like accept and reject and Oh yeah. In fact R_S_T_ doesn't give you anything like that. Okay. Right. Right. Right, okay. D so I think it's much more impor I think it would make more sense to go about this problem figuring out what kinds of relationships we want and then finding and, you know, like setting down what the constraints are on the analysis game. He's been looking at the data, okay, s to good. Um and then and then there are lots of different theories of argument. I mean you can also think about the sort of joint problem solving kinds of um approaches. So you know, Clark and Lockbaum and, you know, that that kind of thing. That were designed for dialogue, right, I mean, and can be expanded to more than two persons. Actually the Lockbaum stuff is for groups. Yeah, I was just gonna say it would be useful to know what m But who's they? That's the question. Who? Right. Mm-hmm. Well I mean I think that um w it I don't know uh w it'd probably get to re hear, you know, more of your presentation because I think there are lots of different candidates and you certainly can't go through and mark up every meeting, I mean mark up meetings with every scheme we think of. So I think we have to kind of get an overview of what the candidates are m if there's like two or three that we think are good contenders, then we try to see what works better, right. There are a lot of option there are a lot more options. So so let's see what what else you've got. Oh, so that was it on dialogue, okay. Okay. So uh it's very unclear to me why you think exchange of information is more principal t uh did you I mean what did you have specific schemes in mind there? Or spec mm specific people's work that you um But can you give us an example of a scheme that's based on exchange of information? Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay, so I mean I think that um there are a lot of things that we have to look at before, I mean Yeah. I mean and Well, we're marking up a lot of higher level things in our Okay. So um have you looked at Nate Blaylock's work? So he has things like, you know, adopt um so basically it's to, you know, collaborative problem solving, you know, more than one person involved, and trying to characterise things as um You know, if I I can't remember the I can't remember the names of all the actions. No, so so the Coconut project is a project that I did with Rich Thomasson and Barbara DiGinio. Have you looked at that? Not very clear. No. Though there's a lot of detail in the paper. But you haven't looked at it no in very much detail. Okay, so I think you should, um because it was all these things that are done for joint problem solving and joint action I think are very relevant to look at because these people are solving a problem together, right. So um while these schemes may not have they have some es of the essential components that you need to characterise um joint problem solving. So while th um you may think that they're missing something, then we we could certainly augment them. But I think that they have to be looked at. And so so Nate Blaylock tried to okay, so you know, from Gross and Krauss and Gross and Sidener came all this stuff about shared plans and how you really can't understand, you know, dialogue u unless you understand shared plans. But the actual theoretical um or formalisation of it was incredibly complex. And so um Lockbaum simplified it quite and, you know, Sidener and Rich and Collagen have simplified it quite a bit. Um but Nate Blaylock tried to um, you know, define, you know, what happens after somebody suggests something. Well, you can adopt it, you can well I can't remember you know, okay, but he has uh he has a taxonomy yeah, right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly, right. Um which we tried to apply to tutoring, but it actually doesn't work very well for tutoring 'cause tutoring's just a totally different ball game. But um it you know, we spent a fair amount of time looking at it and it did strike me that for joint problem solving there w there were some good ideas. And there is, you know, a set of tags and what they mean and, you know, that sort of thing. And then you can also look at, you know, cl you know Clark on joint action. Now he's not gonna give you a set of tags 'cause that's not the kind of guy he is. But um But the overarching idea, you know, I mean I think accounts for a lot of the ways in which um, you know, these other people are thi are thinking. But I mean I think that we we basically have to merge some of this stuff that's been done, you know, on meetings with some of the stuff that's been done on collaborative problem solving 'cause there's elements of each that seem really important. And I think th Because it really seems to me that, you know, if you look at and some of this stuff on exchange is like ancient and you know, they didn't have the ability to mark up lots of data and count things, you know. So I mean all the conversational analysis stuff, I mean those guys never count anything, you know. I mean they're uh ps so they see a pattern and then they think it's kinda cute and then they scour the world for third turn repairs, you know. They don't actually say how often do those happen. I mean they worked I mean I know Manny Schegloff really well and they're not counters. They're purposely not counters. They define themselves as non-counters. Mm-hmm. Yeah, th I mean it it does seem like, you know, there's something that we want from that and then there's something that we want from collaborative problem solving. And if you l if you take the exchange stuff, it's not gonna d quite do everything you want, and if you look at the collaborative problem solving stuff, maybe it won't do every that you want. And so Hmm. Like somebody's writing on the white-board or I mean the w meeting actions they presented at the review seemed really low level to me, like somebody stood up. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I mean I I realise it's important to recognise that, you know, what Wei-Xun got up and went to the white-board. I realise that's important, you know. But I d was kind of surprised that those meeting actions. So Yeah, mm okay. Well I think we should approach it both ways. I mean uh you know, I I d You know, the meeting browser people have a lot of constraints. And so what they end up with saying is most critical for them right now might not be the most interesting thing in the longer term. And so Right. I mean people have said over and over again that they would like to understand how a decision has evolved, right. Um and I think that Well, I don't know if all of this low level stuff would allow you to track that kind of thing, but it might at least be the building blocks of allowing you to track that kind of thing and Yeah, some higher level yeah. So I mean I think it's clear that something at this level needs to be there. I mean and to ask questions, like who disagreed or were there any counter proposals or whatever. Even those kind of questions you need some kind of mark-up like this. Well that brings up something interesting because I think probably what we should do is try to get you know, some of these tasks sort of put on, you know, sort of as part of the official agenda. So being able to answer questions like um were there any counter proposals to the bana you know, banana shape or whatever. Um uh or to some specific, you know, recommendation and things like that. I mean, you know, those, you know, strike me as cl clear things that, you know, people who go to decision making meetings want to know if they've missed one or are arriving late or anything like that. So it wou it seems like we should probably get some of these things on the official agenda and say look, you know, wouldn't it be nice if you could have answers to these questions, or something. Oh. No, m So And I think we wouldn't wanna necessarily do this on ICSI data. I think the ICSI data is too too complex, and there aren't enough real decisions made, you know, that you could clearly identify. I mean there are some, but and not that I've read more than about two meetings. But um I think, w it, you know w well, so one thing that's gonna be interesting is the, I think to me, is the um what can you do because presumably the um D_F_K_I_ folk or somebody is gonna mark up a lot of the data with sort of tags about ontology, right? So we know, you know, somebody will have gone and by hand and sort of marked up som something l like shallow semanticy kinds of things, right, or maybe deeper semanticy things, but that but you know, not really in a in a formal language, but mostly just, you know, tags, right? Um and then the question is, well, how does you know, just the way people typically do this is, you know, let's take these semantic features into or these features into account and see how well we do with the the learning, and then let's throw these features out and see how well we do, um because we know we're gonna have them, because one or two sides is really intr are really interested in this ontology stuff, right? I mean T_N_O_ is and D_F_K_I_ is, right. So there will be some kind of domain semantics. And there will also be presumably some kind of task hierarchy modelling going on in I mean 'cause the whole browser working group um final um sort of presentation on that second day was about, you know, knowing the task, right. And very you know, details about which task is this you know, which sub-task is this little chunk of the meeting addressing and furthering in various ways, right. Which seems like it would be really hard in an open domain. You remember when Steve came in, Steve Whittaker came in at the end and said, you know, they'd spent the morning talking and they came up with this idea. Um No, they said people are talking about tasks, you know. I mean they really they made it clear that they were that that was gonna be heavily No, those are the s those are the scenarios. Those are the user scenarios. The task what what he came back and said that at the end, I mean it actually kind kind of scared me, because it was all based around tasks. And and the domain tasks, okay, they're now they now have to decide how many buttons to put on this thing. I mean it was all about the domain task. And it is really the it and given that, uh it it's really scary to think about what you could possibly do in an open domain where you don't where you don't know what the tasks are. And I don't think you're gonna be able to figure them out uh very reliably. I do, but the whole project is, you know, focussed on AMI hub data as their first priority. N no no no no no, but I mean if the if the if they had th they had this sort of epiphany at the end of this meeting where they decided well why are people browsing this. Well it's all to see how, you know, how the participants were furthering their tasks. Well right. And then, yes, and then there was this confusion about the um last spider phone conference that the messages telling people to call came out after the meeting happened, at least to some of us. So um I mean we'll we'll get that back on track. But I think that um we don't you know, there will be some meeting browser demo that um, you know I I think it's an interesting question of okay well, if you have knowledge, here's what you can do. If you don't have that knowledge you have to do different things and, you know, you can't necessarily Well I think when he does re when he does lear these learning experiments, he should do 'em two ways. Because he will have this opportunity with or without. And then we can see like well without, you know, these tags so you know, Alex was showing um yesterday well without knowing the head word of the utterance at the leaf, you know, you get these kinds of results, and when you add that in, you get these other kinds of results. And you know, I think yeah. Um so I think if we have those features, it's, you know, it's a rare orp or rare opportunity that you can, you know, you can try one head to head against the other. Um and then of course to make sure that you really um Right. Well we won't I mean we won't use 'em till they're ready obviously. So we might do the sort of open domain, I mean a although it will be a closed domain, I mean we we can't use any domain information necessarily. Uh I mean, there probably are a bunch of issues like if you've got a hundred hours of meetings and they all talk about a lot of the same things, then it's ea it it's not really open domain and somehow that sneaks into all the statistics anyway 'cause you don't have such a wide vocabulary and, you know Right. Sure, so we might find that when we move from what we thought was open domain, but on the hub, you know, our results go down when we truly are getting meeting yeah. So I mean that'll be interesting. Okay, well that's good. So okay. So we wanna decide um what Wei-Xun should do next and maybe think about meeting in, I don't know, a month or something. Yeah, mm-hmm. Um so before we do that, can I just ask you a question about chunking? In the beginning you said something about you were doing this chunking um and you're doing it on the ICSI data, but this was did you say it th wasn't picked up in AMI or you I I I was confused about w Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And you and you haven't done it yet. Tha that's fine. So that's still on the agenda to do at some point. Yeah. Exactly. That's Well so I mean right. Um or building blocks. I mean so I mean we have to think about how s chunking interacts with the automatic segmentation, you know. Because um Barbara was showing the low level. And I mean it seems to me that chunking should have some kind of so if if your dialogue act segmenter says there's there's a segment here, but your chunker said no, this is a coherent chunk, then y y you know, w I mean maybe they could work together to do a better job than Right. Yeah. Periods. Oh, after uh right. Okay. Right, okay. Good. So it sounds like well w Well how much AMI Well, you wanted to do the chunking on the AMI data, right? Because m So we got stuck at some point on evaluation of chunking, right. The problem was you didn't have ICSI data that was hand labelled for chunks. And we decided labelling the ICSI data for chunks would be probably difficult and maybe not very useful. And so it it mi Okay, if there if there was if there was hand labelled data that you could evaluate again so train on some and evaluate on some, wouldn't that um 'cause you've trained on Switchboard, right, where there there are chunks. So if you had some ICSI data that you could maybe use, I don't know, um as a what's the n there's t there's a training set and then there's the development set and then there's the test set. Maybe you'd use some chunked ICSI stuff as development or something and do some last tweaks and then evaluate. But you know, w h I mean I can see why Wei-Xun didn't wanna spend his time chunking ICSI d Which means we have to get some portion of the data hand-chunked. How much um well how much in Switchboard. Switchboard is all chunked. Right. Right. Well No, you had Penn tree-bank parses, and you made chunks from that. Mm-hmm. Is anybody gonna parse? Is any gonna try to anybody try to parse the AMI data? Well they're using the E_R_G_, right? The which probably has a l maybe finer g uh which I believe has finer grained distinctions than, and different labels, than the Penn tree-bank. It's I'm t it's probably easy to dumb down the H_P_S_G_ parse too. 'Cause the Penn tree-bank parsers are pretty minimal because they didn't wanna commit to a specific grammatical theory. So I mean it probably is worth looking at 'Cause they're doing this with Dan Flickinger, right? Which is the same um parser as the Redwoods Tree-bank was made with that Alex talked about yesterday. So you can look at Redwoods parses um and see how different they are from tree-bank parses. And you might wanna talk to Alex to find out if somebody's already done this turn Redwoods stuff into tree-bank stuff so that they can compare, you know, against results that are reported on tree-bank. Well that was the idea I believe, but um it was supposed to be another tree-bank. Well the good thing about that is that then you know that when you go through and parse you'll be getting the same chunks as when you do this process automatically. 'Cause the problem w when you go through and hand do it is then suddenly you introduce your automatic method and your accuracy goes can go way down. I mean sometimes it doesn't if you know, sort of for part of speech tagging, you know, whether you do it by hand or machine, it's pretty much the same accuracy, right. But They talked about it at the meeting that we went to in Twente. I was thinking Enschede. Why can't I remember the n the f the right name of this place? Yes, Twente. Which You were there Jean. Yeah, okay. No no no no, no no no, I I I know you missed a meeting and s and so there there may have been you missed the one in T_N_O_. On on which project? Sorry, I didn't get that. Verbmobil, right. Yes, yes, they did. It well that's that's what Alex talked about yesterday, right. The parse I mean that's wasn't something she did, but that's the data she's using, right. So we have all that stuff here, you know, the parsed Verbmobil material. So you can look at that and see what the parse trees look like. You don't need to wait for D_F_K_I_. And if it turns out that you think oh, there's no way I can map these into Penn tree-bank style bracketing, then then we have to think of something else, right. But I think they had that in mind. So it's it's worth also talking to her about that. Okay, good. Everybody always says there's no data like more data. You know, I mean the typical thing is to do leave one out cross validation with, you know, eighty nine dialogues. Okay, so I trained on eighty eight and then or I train on one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and Okay, but we should speak to Steve. We might have some um Well the question the question is what what is chunking gonna help? I mean I think chunking could help automatic dialogue act segmentation. I think chunking could help, as you mentioned, named entity recognition. Um Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well we'd wanna make sure we're pretty happy that it's reliable because Mm yeah. I mean otherwise you get these very bizarre results because the data is not really very good. So um but I and nobody has expressed like massive interest in t in chunking. So I think, you know, nobody's uh waiting for it. But but we could we c I think we should talk to Barbara about how to do some joint experiments or or if she's gonna be sending other people, maybe Liz or whoever comes over next time. Uh and it would actually be great if it was Liz, because I think she is the one who did the dialogue act segmentation automatic She just said that hopefully by the next meeting she would be bringing someone else, or someone else would be coming instead of her, remember? The th not to have not to have it done, but just to talk about how it could interact with automatic dialogue act segmentation. Um and we I guess we should talk to Yoshi about about it in relationship to named entities. Who's uh who's doing named entities besides Yoshi? Okay. So we could talk to Vasilis about that as well. And then So one thing that would be very helpful for me because I haven't read I think we're in a situation where Jean, you know, has read a lot of literature and I've read a lot of literature and we there is some overlap, but there's also quite a big space where we don't know the literature from the other side. And since you're gonna be reading it, I mean it would be probably be useful if you made some kind of, you know, report that described, you know, okay, this what these people you know, this is, you know, a synthesis okay, here's the basic idea behind exchange structure and, you know, here's a couple of you know, here's the two most relevant works that I've read or something like that, you know, to just Or even just like a paragraph of, you know, the basic idea. Just because, you know, obviously I'm not gonna go rea off and read all this kind of stuff because I don't have time. And you probably don't have time to read all this collaborative prol problem solving. So Well in any way, every time you write a paper, you've got to go back and do this related work thing anyway. So it just it just makes it a lot easier um to get that common ground I think, you know. I think it's a real advantage that we've read different things and come at it from a different side because I think this ha they the the previous approaches haven't really, you know, taken you know, the good features from, you know, both sides and and tried to put them together. Yeah, me too. I can send you a l Well I think we both wanna send w well, I don't know, maybe you've already done this, but I you know, I will send you or we can, you know, chat off-line for a minute a about a list of things that I think you really need to take a look at. And Jean, probably maybe you should do the same. Um And if Sabrina has any ideas, we'd be happy to hear from Sabrina as well. Um Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. M Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well I think we need to um, like you mentioned earlier, um factor in what this might be used for in the end. And so even if it we won't it won't be used, maybe if it would need some higher level analysis before it could be directly used for that purpose, we should still keep that in mind. And so I think going through the presentations that um were given at the work package six meeting where um and I think it was um it wasn't wha was it Anita or was it oh I've forgotten her name, the other woman um from Twente, you know, they talked about they did they had done a lot of questionnaires, and they got some user requirements out of that. And then Steve presented um the results of following people around and looking at how they used their notes from meetings. And and so that would give us some ideas about, you know, what people want, you know, out of meeting records. But then we should also add things that we think are interesting. But just to have to keep some of these goals in mind 'cause they're t o one scheme might let you answer this set of questions but wouldn't help you at all with another set of questions. So should we expect that all the slides from like the work package six meeting or the joint work package five work pa will be u up on one of the work package web sites? And if not, how do we make that happen? Hmm okay. Some of this was presented in at least the one spider phone or the second spider phone telecon I went to for work package six. So if they're not on the web we can try to look at that, you know, at the materials that were presented in that telecon without necessarily listening to the whole telecon. Yeah? Wh And Steve m and his I've forgotten the name, is it was it Simon, his yeah. They they've I think they may have written this up um in a report um, but I wou would hope that's on the work package six web site as well. I do as i once he's read a couple more I mean he's just completely missed out the collaborative problem solving world, which I d I really think we need to take into account. I mean you may take it into account and say no, you're wrong, and here's why, but I I I'm gonna need some convincing. Or t or or two and see this one gives you this and this g and can't you know, are they fundamentally incompatible. Or can we yeah, mm-hmm. Okay. I think this is gonna take about three weeks 'cause he's got plenty of reading to do. So maybe we get together again in the yeah, I mean, I'll send them the references immediately. Is that enough time for you do you think? Is that enough time for you to to read and think about If y if if it's too tight, you know, I think m we can say four. Or are you gonna be on holiday? Yeah. Maybe four weeks? Okay. Okay. So we should get together probably in about four weeks, yes. So when are you gonna bring this beautiful baby in to see everybody? Good, good. That's great. Yep. Well good luck solving your problem. I have to tick and tick? It does something weird when you do that.
Five years just because of the floods bringing the ceilings down. So On its great joy. I think they probably ought to, but uh they well, they've only just started realising that treating this as a legal issue is probably the right way to look at it. So they're not really the sort of people that are up for understanding um the intricacies of the committee, I guess. I mean i you would have thought they could, but it's r it's actually quite hard work. The law isn't very clear. That's a good question. They p they uh they might be able to. It's just it's so strapped now, um you know, like the Citizens Advice Bureau is so hard to actually get access to because they've they have so many cases and so few people. So But yeah, that's probably the next thing they'll have to do. M Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Right. Well um I thought the right thing to do was to review what Wei-Xun's been doing in the area of dialogue structure for work package one over the last period. So basically for him to talk about what he what progress he's been making and then for us to um for hi for him to describe what work he intends over the next period of the project, and for us to figure out what help he needs with that. Um m maybe give him some help figuring out what publications he's gonna um get out of this and for us to make sure that it fits into the overall project. So um this is something that you know, we're not gonna do everything today, but I wanted to make sure that we sort of all aligned on what he was doing at the moment and and then sort of figured out how to give him the best advice coming up. So that's that's why I called this. I'm a little bit confused. So um when you say interactivity, do you mean um well, how would you characterise a highly interactive meeting? What are the measurements you'd apply? So you I think what you're doing is segmenting meetings into highly interactive parts and not so interactive parts, where you think some of them are like a bit like dialogue and some are a bit like monologue. So what measurements would you apply to um find out which is which? So you mean relatively short turns and speaker change. S So so am I right in thinking you think that you can segment meetings maybe into two t types of areas, interactive and non-interactive? So what are th what are the characteristics of the interactive areas? So w so okay, so but you just said, I think, that you would characterise short turns as being the non-interactive parts. Oh okay, well we we can discount back-channels. I mean uh c are you is it okay if we talk about this for a minute 'cause I'm confused. Or or do you get a c Alright. Alright. 'Cause if this is all we've got, I think we should uh have interactive and non-interactive on the board and then figure out what properties going to each just so we're clear what the two mean. Uh Well uh okay But are you you need to be more precise what you mean by speaker change. So y do you mean all of the speakers are involved in it? Is it sufficient for two speakers? Right, and then Okay, but that's n you can that's definitional, right. So so I mean you wouldn't necessarily consider that to change the turns. Those are just back-channels. So one speaker will have the floor channel um throughout that and so I guess what you're saying is that the interactive sections would have shorter speaker turns when you're not considering the back-channels as interruptions. Um so Well do y Yeah. Sufficient but not necessary maybe. It depend if you had so a bunch of people all just giving information and opinion around the table and they never actually ask questions of each other, but the turns were actually quite short, which one would it be? Mm-hmm. Right, okay. I remember you saying this before. So basically you want to do the segmentation because you're going to apply completely different analyses to the two sections. Um Right. So Wei-Xun quite takes quite a strong position on um this um difference between these two um kinds of group activities because he says that they admit different kinds of analyses. Right, the with the non-interactive, more monolo mono-logic sections of the meeting um you have to uh analyse them using something akin to rhetorical structure or something. And uh with the other sections you uh um you you use some other theory to look at them. And I actually uh think that that's a slightly extreme um position um with regard to the literature that a lot of people might say it doesn't really matter who the different speakers are in an interactive section. You can still um build maybe the the same argument structure over the top of the basic um acts and propositional content that's there. And uh what you get is a messier version of the argument structure because not everybody has the same argument in their brain, you know, for this. But um but that the same theory or the the same analysis can be applied to both parts. So I think it's important to keep um that in mind, and if you if you do need to argue that these two kinds of group activities uh can can only be analysed if you use different analytical mechanisms, then you have to explain why that is. Right, so it it puts an extra burden of proof on the work that you do. Mm. Right. But to the grou degree that a group is building an argument together, I mean it I think wh what you're doing in a group discussion isn't necessarily one coherent argument f for the person, but an argument that is the group view. And so it's maybe it's not R_S_T_, um but it's um more akin to um I don't know, is it Toolman? But, you know, not that i but you know, the kinds of things where people to try to represent argument structure. Are are the important aspects of it for this analysis really that substantively different though? But i if somebody if there's been an argument so far in a group meeting, and um somebody makes a statement, they have an intention about how to modify that group argument. Right, but but you're Okay, so the r the relation names aren't aren't right, but um Right. Okay. Well the relation names are less important. I mean people have argued for ages about exactly what relations were in any of these theories. And that's that's less important than what the theory is trying to achieve. And it just seems to me that if you've gotta have two dif separate apparatuses for the um speaker internal um argument structure and the group argument structure, that that's more appara apparatus than you should actually need for um from doing this kind of analysis. 'Cause in both cases you're um building up an argument publicly in this group meeting and then, you know, adding something or changing the existing argument in some way by relating a contribution to what's um already on the table. So Mm. Yeah, c I just think well, I mean it all of these things when they encounter a new genre of um of uh actual data, then they end up modifying building new kinds of relations with new kinds of semantics and adding them. That's the entire history of these. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah. Right. So there you've got somebody who's doing theoretical development that would claim that you don't need two separate an analytical frameworks for these two types of activities that Wei-Xun has identified. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I just prefer it to be one thing rather than two completely separate things and then the added explanation of why it's not possible to have the same thing applied to both halves. Hmm, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, which wouldn't probably wouldn't give us the kind of um information that we need about relations across turns, just because we really are critically interested in the argument um that the group is building up so that we can find the decisions that they made and um any p uh counter proposals to proposals that have been made and things. I mean it really is more in the spirit uh of the R_S_T_ ish relations than um than in the damsel kinds of relationships. What we want uh out of the c um the relationships between speakers here. They are jointly building up an argument structure, and that is the critical thing that we're missing in order to be able to um understand what's happening in these meetings. So we wouldn't we wouldn't wanna do the same thing as what um she did in this case, bec just because um damsel doesn't give you the right sort of representation between speakers. Oh, does it? Okay, um I haven't seen it on that this kind of data. So maybe Right, okay, but are what I mean is, you kno wanna make sure you get the argumentative relations, however you do it. Whichever relations you have to build, you know. Not I'm not saying I'm not saying that there's a particular set of tags or relations that have been defined out there that are the right ones. I'm just saying we need the correct ones for th the structure that we're trying to get out of this. 'Cause we need certain information out of this analysis. That Yeah. Well Wei-Xun's been looking at the data. So that's that's a step for this. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, yeah. Well, what you'll need in the end is something operational. So it's something that you can use to actually segment meetings into the um the areas that you think are important for this analysis, right? So um it's not quite clear to me what the different kinds of things are. So it would be I think handy if you could take a meeting at some point and say, you know, this is a interactive area and this is a mono-logic area because and we could come up with what kinds of measurements you need. Um I mean we have w we haven't done past work here on segmenting meetings in that way, but we have done work on characterising different kinds of meetings um in terms of how highly interactive they are. But it's a different definition, right. It's in terms of how much all of the people involved in the meeting um take some take equal part in it as opposed to um like the highest state is people in the meeting just driving it and and uh the other people following whatever the high state is people want. So um but those kinds of measures um, you know, we could use to um to do this kind of segmentation if it's important to the analysis, right. W but we need clearer definitions of what the different things are, how many different kinds of of um activities are there. You know, is it just interactive and non-interactive, or is there are there there more grades of shading than that. And um, you know, what are the things that you expect in each. What's the back-channelling behaviour. What's the speaker turn, um you know, what kind of dialogue acts do you expect. I think that would help you pin down what the definitions are. Do you think it matters whether something is knowledge or opinion in the way it contributes to the group process? Yeah. I I sort of have always taken the view that um that well, people aren't very good at at this kind of rationality, you know. And the difference between information and opinion isn't that prominent in the way people do their reasoning. So um Yeah. Well you you can't define 'em that way. You can't define the difference between information and opinion that way because that's um basically defining as the what happened about it. And I think what tends to happen is that um if people challenge the the facts, you often discover that they weren't actually solid facts anyway, you know, that they're I think the boundary between these is kind of fluid. So I guess the question is is it important to what what's it important to? So do you need the difference between information and opinion to do this analysis? So what have you been looking at? So you're you've got books that high on your desk. Which ones are they? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. So y um I'm sort of getting that you think there is a lack in the uh theory to do with exchange structure at the moment. But I'm but I'm not quite clear yet what you think the lack is. So Um the well are you thinking it's been a while since I've read this literature. But I mean my understanding of exchange is is that the initiating move introduces a goal to the discourse, and then the remaining moves um will uh contribute to either the um the meeting of that discourse goal or the decision not to bother with that discourse goal, right. And so um I'd be surprised if there wasn't work describing things in those terms. I mean I know Sinclair and Coulthard is is basically about teaching yeah. So you wouldn't expect that to necessarily um apply uh in in wider contacts in a way. Like you might expect to have to extend the theory to do that. But I th I think there are other other people have looked at exchange structure and described it in these terms in a way that should really suit your needs. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So this is a l a lot like George Horton's work on saying what are the different parameters for um these exchanges. You know, what are the things that characterise the set of exchanges that can happen? Mm. So so is your complaint less about um less about knowing what makes an exchange and more about knowing how you parameterise exchanges for this genre? So what's the range? okay, so you're worried about what's the range of exchange types for this genre, and that's what you think hasn't been done. Uh-huh. Okay. That's clearer. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So so have have you tried I mean um I know of one previous attempt to establish what exchanges are needed for f um some kinds of industry meetings, and our experience in that project was that um you can't really identify exchange structures in these meetings because they they don't really follow that pattern. That exchanges are clear in um well, i there're clearer in when you've got fewer people. So there's fewer people trying to pull the discourse goals in different directions. Um and they're clearer when um your goals are quite limited. So when you've just got information exchange and you know, the or there's a clear task that the people are trying to do and they're focussed on that task, as is normal in dialogue elicitation like map task or like your like your informa which like your information seeking dialogues, which wasn't dialogue elicitation, but it was very constrained in genre. So um the the answer to the question might be nobody knows what the catalogue of exchanges is for real meetings because um or for these decision making meetings because you can't identify exchanges, right. So have you gone through the meetings and looked for initiations and responses with without a prior catalogue, just knowing that init initiation in introduces a new discourse goal and a response um meets or negates that goal in some way. So have you tried marking these exchanges? Mm-hmm. Yeah. But but a reading of this, you know, th could tell you that there is no case where you're gonna be looking for initiation and responses that's gonna work, you know. 'Cause you could go through and see that um actually the pattern of of addressing different discourse goals is too dispersed to um to be able to do that kind of mark-up. But I g yeah, I mean i obviously you wanna have a front-runner scheme i in mind before you So that's it. Yeah. Do you mean an action in terms of what the group is requiring him to do or do you mean an action in like picking something up? So action in the technical meeting sense or just action in the physical sense. Right, okay. Oh, so that's not a physical action, right? Uh uh if I pick this up, which is a physical action, you can't reject that. What do you mean? Right. That's right, that's a action in the sort of technical sense of meetings. So you are actioned to do something, which is part of the permanent record that yeah, okay. Well, there are very few uh schemes for marking up exchanges on actual data, right, because um people haven't considered it very important. Well I always thought they get tired after marking up the dialogue moves so they nev never bother with any higher level dialogue structure. So we did it in the map task, but I don't actually know of other cases where people bothered marking anyth anything higher level than the map than the move structure. Right? You don't know of On yeah, I've s uh sorry. Um but it c it's not been very popular car probably 'cause it makes um Different. Mm-hmm, yeah. Well the first step is find out in the what how much of the material does the collaborative problem solving cover? So how much of a genre clash is there here? Well it's Yeah. B th But there there are people in the field that are moving that direction, like Martin. And also what's important here is the theoretical clarity about what an initiation and a response is. So what is it that ties um different acts together at a higher level, you know. Mm-hmm. But I think more important than looking at um whether parts of the meeting are highly interactive or not so interactive is uh looking at what sort of task the people are trying to do at the moment. So you know, are they doing um uh i are are they uh i as in the kick off meeting just exchanging information to get started with a project or are they uh actually addressing some specific design um criteria at the moment. Should try to decide which shape the thing is. Um because that's going to affect the kinds of relations that you get between the utterances. And so that is much more like um the um the literature from McGrath about the different kinds of activities groups get into. So I think that's another thing that has to be pulled into this because um you you do require different uh uh different kinds of relations. Or you expect different kinds of relations from some over-arching set in um those different kinds of activities. Uh Um so what's the high level version again? P s Right, okay. I mean i the meeting actions is just gonna be a segmentation. It's not going to present any s any micro-structure. So it's just gonna say from here to here they're doing something. That's all that that scheme is gonna do. W It's n That's not no, those well, that's individual actions. And the meeting actions are meant to b uh become more um semantic and more theoretical than the kind IDIAP have traditionally used. So so we need to still preserve some uh sense of the activity. But rather than saying it is somebody's at the white-board, it'll be, you know, that somebody's explaining something that the others are focussed on. Yeah. It's it's a different scheme. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well you might need the meeting action segmentation in order to know where what uh what area you're circumventing for so, it's just exchange structure in this area that you're looking at, and then that's a solid boundary between the next bit or something. I don't know. Um but w well, time's getting on. So, you know, what practical things can we do to help this work move forward? So y show what else you're you're thinking about, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.. Well m marking up exchange structure if if it's there and if um if you've got a working scheme for it is relatively cheap. It's a lot cheaper than doing dialogue act coding in the first place. Um right, well one presumes it is, otherwise it's gonna be ra radically expensive to do any kind of mark-up. So um the you know, it's something that we can look at, but you need to what we need it's more important than knowing, you know, that we need exchange structure marked up on X_ amount of data at this point is knowing um where you're headed with this, I think. So what's the good that that uh the project gets out of this in the end. So you know, what's the w what's the headline results of the work on the project, I think is is what we're trying to get a sense of here. So you get your exchange structure marked up. And say we just put in the money, get exchange structure marked up on that entire hub or, you know, figure out how to boot-strap it so we we get this um uh how do you how do you sell that as a as a project goal, you know? 'Cause people are gonna say exchange structure, so what. What do wh what do you what how do you plug that into the rest the stuff, right? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. See 'cause I think that um just to make this m more efficient, you should be thinking about the high-level goal in order to focus the work that you're doing rather than thinking well, you know, there's these theories, you know, how can we apply these theories to it. Um and then seeing what comes out of that that might be useful for the meeting browser, actually trying to say yeah, we have a goal of being able to do this with the meeting browser, um what kinds of dialogue structure would we need to be able to do that. I mean uh I don't know, maybe you'd wanna disagree with that, but I this more goal directed might actually make it easier to um bring these things to publication in the long run, right? Right. It's not necessarily what they say. But it's something at least identify something that we'd hope to get out of it, you know. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I It just helps you know which theory you should be concentrating on. So you know, that immediately discounts exchange um structures that are mostly for information seeking alone because the notion exchange is to restrict it there, and in favour of um these these more argumentative things. So I mean uh I do think you should keep in mind what the final goal is so that you can plug this into something at the end and and um show some benefit of having the mark-up. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I mean operationally it's not gonna much difference whether it's hub or not, right, because we've got the bank of people. We have to get the hub stuff through, but um you know, he's n not ready with an annotation scheme that can be used at the moment anyway. So And it it's not that expensive. I mean it's something that we can afford off budget 'cause Yeah, it uh and it's too different a genre, yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's not help either. But yeah, they're sure to do that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. In the m Mm-hmm. Y Um well, I don't remember that about the w I mean the Oh, but that was about what task the person doing the browsing was gonna do. It w they didn't say anything about what sort of information they'd want from the meeting itself. It w it was about uh i That was the that we the browser task. You know they've identified these seven different tasks people might wanna do with browsers, um you know, like uh join a meeting late and ch um catch up on what's happened in the meeting so far, be at home waiting for the washing repair guy. And Yeah. Okay, well c maybe. Okay. Mm-hmm. But I thought you wanted to avoid doing stuff that was s stuck in this particular domain if possible. But you know, th they weren't concentrating Well yeah. But that doesn't mean you have to be um using the techniques that you can be using open-domain techn Mm-hmm. And you don't think that can be done in open domain at all. 'Cause we don't wanna get into um working with ontologies. I mean one of the strengths of this grouping was that, yeah, they all work with the closed domain ontologies and we'll do the open-domain side of things. So I don't know. We'll see. Oh right, yeah. So we don't know what happened at that one. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So you're advising Wei-Xun that he should be using like any ontologies and propositional content that um D_F_K_I_ and T_N_O_ bank in the C_V_S_ repository, or or not? That's what I'm not clear on. With our without. Mm-hmm. Okay. Can actually try. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't know when they'll bank these by the way. Um 'cause that's it's not hub. So i it's one of these things where everybody's supposed to bank as many things as possible. So you know w Yeah. But open. Yeah, it's not really an open domain task, yeah. Well eventually the hub is supposed to be forty percent non-scenario. But that data's definitely gonna be kind of coming in the last. So Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's quite reasonable. W we've got five ISCA meetings actually which are still uh an elicitation task, but they're not our domain. So that should help some. And they've been declared hub. So so they'll accrue all of the normal an annotations. Of course yeah, you'll you'll never get the T_N_O_ and D_F_K_I_ stuff on it 'cause they're only billing stuff for the one to make the Yeah, just figure out how we're gonna help him to to try to make this more efficient. Yeah. Yeah, but we should make sure we finish that off, because otherwise that work's just wasted, right. We're gonna use chunks for something useful. Yeah, chunks are gonna be named entities if nothing else. Automatic segmentation at which level? Uh-huh. Dialogue act, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and that's a problem. Yeah. Certainly if if you've got chunks it ought to help you know where your dialogue act boundaries better not be. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And it may be even more mechanical than that based on the um examples we're seeing from D_F_K_I_. 'Cause they're they're hand marking stuff and the dialogue act boundaries are supposed to be intentional. Um but they seem to always be marking them that um uh after verbs, you know, with clause m uh it's very it looks quite mechanical. So we're querying them about this because that's not the way they're supposed to be doing it. And Well hold on. But when do we need chunking by? And it you know, so y I don't like the idea that, you know, you start something and then eighteen months later you pick up to do the last ten percent of the work to finish it off or whatever. So it I like things kinda tidy. Right. So how much work is there left and when do we actually need it by would be useful to discuss. The AMI data is is there. There's I mean there's hub set A_ is transcribed I think um in final form. You we can check the Wikis. But you know, the data is rolling in. So And but Barbara still says somebody's done this for chunks. I'll have to look up, you know, so Mm. Hand-chunked. Mm-hmm. But that shouldn't be that hard to do, right? How much data do you need? I don't read lips. What was that? Was it hard? Yeah. They the data how much data you need was not a problem with the Switchboard 'cause he had lots. So he didn't have to think about how much. So we need to know how much data you need hand-chunked. And then uh how do you hand-chunk stuff, right. So you were were working on instructions for doing hand-chunking. For Switchboard, yeah. But then he there were two possible options for uh for doing this on the AMI data. You could either um essentially go the same route as they did with the Switchboard um, you know, do the Penn tree-bank and then create the chunks off that, or you could chunk directly. And it wasn't clear to us which one of those two methods was the right way to do this. Right, well, so you'd have to produce as part of this exercise. You would've thought so, but I dunno. Oh yes, yeah, I'd forgotten about that. But that's not very similar. Well, I don't know very much about grammar. Is th is that similar enough that that this same method could apply that we derive chunks off the H_P_S_G_ output? I think you might lose a lot in, you know, this step. So basically your your chunker is trained on something that was derived off Penn tree-bank. And it might be different enough that that actually causes it not to match. You know, if you're suddenly evaluating against chunks that were done using H_P_S_G_ I don't know about grammar, but it you know it Yeah. And the mappings are can be cr pretty difficult for this, right? Or is is easy to map between finer grained distinctions and coarser ones? Think so? Yeah. Huh. The names would suggest that this was the idea, right. Yeah. Right. So y that sort of assumes that we think it's better to do this by deriving chunks from um some parsed format than just hand chunking the stuff. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So let's try it this way, and then that that puts off the question of um when do we have to do this to when we get H_P_S_G_ stuff, right? So can you ask um D_F_K_I_ whether they can give us a couple AMI meetings run through their H_P_S_G_ process? I don't even know what time scale they had in mind. I mean it is this something they w they were doing it at the moment, but I don't know whether this was very preliminary or do you remember? Twente, yeah. Yeah. Y you're expecting me to remember stuff, aren't you? Oh yeah. Oh, I don't even know which one I've missed. Brussels, Amsterdam. T_N_O_, okay. See, I wasn't there. So I don't know where it was. Um Yeah. Yeah. So ask 'em, right. So it's talk to Alex, see if it looks like it maps by looking at the Verbmobil. If it does, ask D_F_K_I_ either for data or a time scale, and you're gonna need to know how much data you need in order to do that. So do you have a technique for estimating how much data you'd need? I don't know how you do that, so who knows how you do that? Okay. So just ask D_F_K_I_ how much data and when, right. If Yeah, I know. Uh we don't have any particular time in mind when we need a chunker that works on this stuff. So Yeah. Yeah. Well I gue if we did a chunked version of the AMI data and stuck it into C_V_S_ under the automatic contributions then um people would end up using it, 'cause they do that, right. So the question is at what stage should we put that in? Yeah, so post-evaluation so we can put in some idea of what the evaluation is like. Mm-hmm. No, but he's relying it on it th this summer. Mm-hmm. So when when do you think that would be? When when is she sending somebody? Oh for the next one, mm-hmm. But that's a pretty tight time scale then, right, 'cause it'd be for the fall we'd wanna know the evaluation. Is that the time scale you're thinking of or How it could be done. Yeah. Uh that's all I think. Uh Mm-hmm. I think you should still ask Barbara again, you know, c can you have another think about who might have the chunking stuff. 'Cause she has said several times there must be somebody and she can help with that. And um I think she's just forgotten. So So and then we can evaluate on the ICSI, you know, pretty easily. Yeah, even if it's just a you know, on a Wiki the um the references and then why they're relevant, right. I mean you don't wanna make this really formal, or do you? Yeah, a paragraph each. Yeah. Yeah. But that wou that would help us be a lot more specific ab than than just um you know, listing bullet points on slides cause then we'd know sort of which literature you're thinking of um putting in and we could read the most important argumentative stuff. I can have these things anyway, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. They haven't addressed this problem. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna have to go very soon because I've got this um this hearing to go to. But uh so the practical actions, you know, what are the things we're gonna go away and do. Yeah. Yeah. So you can do this exercise and then come and talk to me some time next week. I'm not in Monday, but the other days I'll be around. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. S Yeah, so this this is interesting, but i w I don't think we can afford to l um look at this right now. So why don't you bring it by um next week? And i what I really wanna do concentrate just now is is finding out the how we're gonna help um Wei-Xun with with making progress on this. So we've already got you know, he's gonna um construct a list of the references he thinks is important, and Johanna and I and and you as well are gonna contribute to that. And we can put that on a Wiki or we can do it some other way. I mean you know I'm Wiki mad. So um if we share it, it should go on a Wiki 'cause I can't find anything in my email. But, you know, you don't have to do that. Um and then uh how do we you're actually so what you're doing is taking all of the the the most important references for um finding argument structure that might i eventually be of some use to a meeting browser and trying to look at actual data and apply and and see like which one helps you figure out what you're actually gonna do with this particular data, right. So it seems to me that we should take like the front-runner scheme and the data and you should look at not front-runner scheme but front-runner theory and i see if you can speak to the data, you know, using that kind of theory at some point. And might might be an interesting exercise, right? The update. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But that's a good starting point, yeah. That'll be the Exactly, yeah. So you wanna go through basically the user requirements and, you know, maybe think about some user requirements of your own and make a case for, you know, these are the kinds of things that we'd want, and look, you're gonna need um this kind of dialogue or argument structure for it. Um uh uh I'll think about that. Yeah. So we're just trying to get records. I mean I'm sure they're not on the web yet. So Yeah. Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So so we're gonna go through the requirements like that and did did you think that's that was reasonable to after that to try and um actually, you know, take some theory that seems fairly reasonable and think about the particular data and come and talk? Yeah. I there's a few references missing. Yeah. Yep. So then try front-runner scheme on, well, a front-runner theory. Yeah. But try it informally. Yep, mm-hmm. When do we get together again? 'Cause I really do have to go. I promised these guys I'd be there. Uh-huh. But w Reading lists before that though, so right? So we'll get together in about three weeks. Uh Uh-huh. Four weeks, yeah. Right. I'm gonna head off. C 'cause floods are more important than dialogue structure, I'm afraid.",EN2005a
"Yeah. Yeah, I mean if we just want to have um some data for the user face, could even be random data. Uh mm mm Yeah, I'm Hmm. Yes. Hmm yes. Hmm. I'm not so sure. I I thought we would just have like um one big summary um with all the uh different importance levels um displayed on it. And depending on what our um zoom level is, we just display a part of it. And we would have one very big thing off-line. And from that we would just select what we are displaying. Yes. So for example you would um give a high value to those um sequences you want to display in the meeting series summary. And you just cut off. That was what I sh I thought, yeah. I thought. But I think the m difference might be that we want just want to have um the words. And that's not so much what he meant with not possibly loading everything was that you m um load all the uh annotation stuff, all the sound files, all In Um I r I I'm getting quite lost um at the moment because um w what's um our difference between the um se um uh the importance measure and the skimming? I mean, do we do both or is it the same thing? Okay. So but when when we talk about summaries you talk about this uh abo about skimming and not about Yeah. Yeah right, isn't that the skimming? Isn't that the skimming? Yeah, but it use the same data. Yeah. A And, yeah, I think we also thought about combining that measure with um the measures I get from um s uh hot-spots and so on. So that would also be on utterance level, I think. I think. Yes, sure. Yes. Yes, right. Oops, it does. So I define baseline and what it loads? For example it loads all the utterances and so on, but it doesn't load um the discourse acts and for example not the and what's what else there? Not the summaries. It only loads those on demand. Y you mean that you um basically split up th the big thing into um different summaries. For example that you have a very um top-level um summary and a separate file for for each level. Mm-hmm. Yes. N Uh no no, it's f for No, you're right. Yeah. It's for Um No, I I think we would just take the segments that are already that were Yeah, there's um this segments file. Um you know, the X_M_L_ segments. Oh. That I don't know. Yeah, that's um Mm-hmm. There there are time stamps um for, well, segments um and for th um segments is for example when when you look at the data, what is displayed in one line. What when when you look at it in the hmm? I think so. Isn't Um for ex um I I compared it with what I did for the pause um duration extraction. Um and basically it's uh words that are uttered in a sequence without pauses. But sometimes um however there are um short pauses in it and they're indicated by square brackets pause or something in the data. Um someti uh but uh the annotators decided what was one segment and what wasn't. I think so. Yeah, but um I think for some annotations um an uttera ca utterance can have several um types. For example for the dialogue acts and so on. Okay. Yeah, that should be for Yeah. Should be, yeah. Yes, but that's Yeah, everything that's a word has a sti time stamp. That's at the end. That's at the end, I think, her time. Yeah, maybe. Didn't have a look at our meetings. Uh I I think it wouldn't as it occurs I mean it would be it occurs in every meeting. So And I think it even has uh its own annotation, like digits or something. So that should be really easy to cut out. Yeah. I'm sure. Ah it's just to test the system, I think. So Mm they have to read numbers from Uh I didn't have a look at that. So They Mm-hmm. Uh th yeah. 'Kay. Um I just um wondered, so who's uh then doing um the frequencies on on the words, because I'm I think I will also um I could also make use of it um for the agreement and disagreement thing. Because I um I in my outline I talked about um using the um discourse acts first, and um then in the chunks of text I found looking for word patterns and so on. So um I would for example need the um most freq um frequent words. So if you cut off all that, I'd won't be use or Yeah, I I but I need it for my chunks then. I would You know? Yeah, but I'd uh I would like to look at the frequency of words in my um in the regions of text I found out to be interesting. So I wouldn't need it. It it would have to be re-calculated only for my segments. Huh? Uh uh mm. I think it would be, you know, l as as big at as the hot-spot annotation things. That's quite small, yeah, that's some utterances. Yes. Yeah, yeah. So I would probably just concatenate all my um text chunks and then let's say m I will run over it. Yes. Yes, definitely. Yeah, right. Ye M Um Jasmine, uh um what is um the text you're extracting uh looking like then at the end? Because um I I think it's actually very similar to what I did for my um speaker um uh extraction and I think I would ch perhaps have to change two lines of codes to get you um for each meeting a file that says fr from um this millisecond to this millisecond there was this sequence of words. And so on. So that's just changing two lines of code. And it would give you that. So Um yeah. So far I extracted um the dura durations. But it's from the words file. So I could just um contatenate concatenate um the words instead of the durations, and it should I mean Should be very straight-forward. I can try to do it and send it to you. Pe and you have a look at it, will it make sense for what you want. Yeah, uh p I mean it I just let it run over all the files. So Yes. I just ordered. Uh I ordered according to the um starting times of the utterances. What do you mean by diffe Yeah, I mean t I I have one what I give you would be one file for each meeting. Yeah, not for each meeting series. I didn't do that yet. Yeah, one group, yeah. Yeah, I mean there's one series that has just one meeting. Yes. Um the you you the data is of the form you have um three identification letter. So B_E_D_ or B_B_D_ or something, and that's always the same group. And then after that there's um a number like O_O_ one, O_O_ two. So, it's a Yeah, but that's that's really quite easy to see because they're named. Yes. But I I mean as um the start uh start times um start for each meeting at zero, you could just probably just um add the um final second time to the next meeting and so on and just put it all together. But then we would have to change um the information about who on which channel it was set, um to by which person it was set. And that is actually stored in another X_M_L_ document. Yeah, I w would then just not print out the um start and end times. No, it's for every single word. Or for every single utterance. Yeah, that depends on what you want. Yeah, but I do it with Perl, it's just string manipulation. So I would I mean I would just Sure. No, I didn't do a sea no. And you would want that all in one file for all the corpus? Or For the series. Yeah, I can directly put it into uh just like So uh only words um per meeting series. Uh-huh. Yes. Yeah, they will just I will just take I would uh take over the names they have anyway. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, one series has the um same three starting letters. So So only words and words and times. And you Yeah, you want it ordered. Okay. Okay, anybody Um ord base dot times. Yeah, and do you want Yeah, sometimes they're contained in one another. So Just after th mm-hmm. 'Kay. Ordered. Only words. Um and I think um for all the corpus, it's just from I know from other times, it's um nine megami byte to have I mean should be should be similar to have the words. Should be. Na um all the words together um for all the meetings. That's what I'm guessing that's, you know, um what I because nine mega-byte is what I got for when I said for every um utterance, this is goes from there to there and takes takes seconds. Oh. Yeah, I mean I'm it doing it for all of it. Doesn't matter. Yeah, I mean I hope it will be the same for the words. It's just what I I Mm-hmm. Mm. So so um I will probably send um just one file of the first meeting um to all those who need it so that you can have a look whether that's what you want. Yeah, I mean if it's just for one meeting, it's really not too big. Yeah. What do we have to demonstrate?
The basic word importance is off-line as well. The combined measure might not be if we want to wait what the user has typed in into the search. Yeah. I'm not quite so what it did you want to do it, i you just wanted to assign Uh I thought about words. Mm. Mm okay. Yeah, but how about those words which don't carry any meaning at all, the um and uhs and something like that. Because if we if we average average over over a whole utterance all the words, and there are quite unimportant words in there, but quite important words as well, I think we should just disregard the the Okay. Alright. Yeah. But there is no I_D_ for an utterance I think. It's just for individual words. So how do we do that then? We for utterances as well. I think it's just for one word. So we have to Yeah. Uh I'm not quite sure, I have only seen that the uh the individual words have got an I_D_. Yeah. You always could have a look at the time stamps and then take the ones that uh belong together to form an utterance. Yeah, if they are already, there's it's easy but it would be possible. Uh yeah. Okay. You s uh you said you are currently in uh implementing the idea. What exactly are you computing? Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I w I w I would need the raw text pretty soon because I have to find out um how I have to put the segments into bins. And then yeah. No, that's not necessary. Yes, I did. But um I've only just got the notes. I have to still have uh to order everything by the time and Yeah, I think it's quite easy after the Yeah. Yeah. So uh Mm-hmm. Yeah, b I uh w that's what I was uh thought. That you just combine them and then order the time stamps accordingly. Okay. Um what I found out was that there are quite a lot of things without without s time stamps in the beginning. Yeah, and uh X_M_L_ files. Yeah, that's just an I_D_ or something. I don't know. Just numbers. Yes, but what are the other things that's uh some kind of number? F maybe the file number or something that is in the beginning. What is that? Do you know? Um I think there are quite a lot of numbers in the beginning where n there is no time stamp for the numbers. It's Think they say um quite a lot of numbers and before that, uh um there's this number. Was it Yeah, there i are numbers in the um the W_ tag, but there are no time stamps. Yeah. Yeah, in the beginning as well sometimes, I think. At least I saw some. Yeah. Yeah. But what it is it actually that numbers? Okay, so but there are no time stamps annotated to that. It's it's quite strange. And also um there are different um combinations of letters. B_R_E_ and something like that. Is it everything ordered are the time stamps global or uh are they local at any point? Okay. Yeah, it's Rainbow. It's um I think it's just the dictionary in the first place. But Um no, I have to bin it up and so I will only have counts for each each bin or something. It's because um Rainbow is a text classification system. And I think it's not possible to have just one class. That's the problem. Maybe we could Yeah sure, you sure, we could do that, but I don't that makes sense. If we need just frequencies, maybe we should just calculate them by using Perl or something. I don't know. Yeah, it's quite easy to just count and s or sort them by um frequency. Just using a Perl script. Is it too big? Yeah. Hmm. I don't know how you how many terms you can handle in Perl. Mm yeah. Uh I can get all the raw text, but it has to be ordered still. So No, it isn't. Um it's in what is implemented in Rainbow is information gain, and I'm not quite sure how they calculate that. Yeah. Uh that's what Rainbow does. I think you j can just get probabilities for a certain words for each document. Certain Um we would have to look at that. Mm-hmm. Oh. Yeah, that's what I thought as well, that you that probably the the topic segment level is the most um informative for the words. Yeah, that's the problem. I don't know. Mm-hmm. So shall we sit together tomorrow then as well? Uh Okay. Um, yeah, w would it be best? At the moment it's it's just lines of Mm-hmm. Um Okay. So um you'd do you extract the words, the raw text, as well? Uh Okay. Mm-hmm. Print out. Okay. Okay, that Okay. So have we already extracted from all the files? Yeah. Did you also order Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Uh I don't need the times, I just need the words. But um Yeah, in the right order. Yes. Yeah, that doesn't matter too much, I think. Hmm. Mm-hmm. How long would it take to make the frequency counts with a Java hash table? Yeah. No, how long you would have to program something. Okay. Mm. Because it's quite easy in Perl as well, it's just a line of code for counting all the words and yeah, it's it's by hashes. Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay.
I I dry-read it the last time.. Next week. Yeah. Yeah. No. Uh mine's gonna be mostly using the off-line. But the actual stuff it's doing will be on-line. But it won't be very um processor intensive or memory intensive, I don't think. Don't think so. Yeah. Are we still gonna go for dumping it into a database? Are we still gonna dump it into a database? 'Cause if we are, I reckon we should all read our classes out of the database. It'll be so much easier. Well if we're gonna dump the part of it into a database anyway, we might as well dump all the fields we want into the database, calculate everything from there. Then we don't even have to worry that much about the underlying X_M_L_ representation. We can just query it. Well if we're gonna do that, we should try and store everything in in an X_M_L_ format as well. Yeah. Yeah. Well we don't even need to do that, 'cause if we got our information density calculated off-line, so all we do is treat the whole lot as one massive document. I mean they'll it's not gonna be so big that we can't load in a information density for every utterance. And we can just summarise based on that. I think you can do it on-line. I don't think there's really much point in doing like that when it's just gonna feed off in the end the information density measure basically. And that's all calculated off-line. So what you're really doing is sorting a list, is the p computationally hard part of it. Well like the ideas we're calculating are information density all off-line first for every utterance in the whole corpus, right? So what you do is you say if you're looking at a series of meetings, you just say well our whole document comprises of all these stuck together. And then all you have to do is sort them by j information density. Like maybe weighted with the search terms, and then extract them. I don't think it's too slow to do on-line, to be honest. Is that Yeah. Well, on the utterance level I was thinking. So the utterances with the highest like mean information density. Well the trouble with doing it on the word level is if you want the audio to synch up, you've got no way of getting in and extracting just that word. I mean it's impossible. For every single word? Oh, okay. Yeah. I don't think that will do it. We'll have to buffer it. Well the skimming's gonna use the importance. But like at first it's just gonna be I_D_F_. Well mostly skimming, yeah. Yeah. Well the nice thing about that is it will automatically be in sentences. Well more or less. So it will make more sense, and if you get just extract words. Yeah. I see it. But it'll need to be calculated at word level though because otherwise there won't be enough occurrences of the terms to make any meaningful sense. Yeah. Yeah, I reckon you can just mean it over the sentence. I think we should filter them. Maybe we should have like um a cut-off. So it a w word only gets a value if it's above a certain threshold. So anything that has less than say nought point five importance gets assigned to zero. Yeah, that's the other th Yeah. I think we'll have to buffer the audio. But I don't think it will be very hard. I think it would be like an hour or two's work. Like just build an another f wave file essentially. Yeah, I mean I bet there would be packages In memory, yeah. So just like unp there's bound to be like a media wave object or something like that. And just build one in memory. I don't know. I have no idea. But it must have like classes for dealing with files. And if it has classes for concatenating files, you can do it in memory. So Well what I think I might try and build is basically a class that you just feed it a linked list of um different wave-forms, and it will just string them all together with maybe, I don't know, tenth of a second silence in between each one or something like that. Normalise it, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, we'll need that. We also really wanna be able to search by who's speaking as well. It doesn't matter, 'cause all the calculation's done off-line. That's easy. You just like create a new X_M_L_ document in memory. I don't think it's really that much of a problem because if it's too big, what we can do is just well all the off-line stuff doesn't really matter. And all we can do is just process a bit at a time. Like for summarisation, say we wanted a hundred utterances in the summary, just look at the meeting, take the top one hundred utterances in each other meeting. If it scores higher than the ones already in the summary so far, just replace them. And then you only have to process one meeting at a time. Okay, so maybe we should build a b store a mean measure for the segments and meetings as well? And speaker. Speaker and um topic segmenting we'll need as well. Yeah. Well yeah, and then it'll f preserve the order when it's displayed the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. So we should basically make our own X_M_L_ document in memory that everyone's um module changes that, rather than the underlying data. And then have that X_M_L_ uh NITE X_M_L_ document tied to the interface. Well, you can make it in a file if you want. Mm-hmm. They are utterances, aren't they? The segments are utterances, aren't they? Yeah. Alright, okay. Well, that's easy. Well it's close enough, isn't it? It may not be exact every time, but it's a so sort of size we're looking for. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But why don't we just write it as a new X_M_L_ file? Can NITE handle just loading arbitrary uh new like attributes and stuff? I mean, I would have thought they'd make it able to. Yeah. So why do we need to have two X_M_L_ trees in memory at once? The other thing is that would mean we'd be using their parser as well, which means we wouldn't have to parse anything, which be quite nice. 'Cause their parser is probably much faster than anything we've come up with anyway. Yeah, I mean we can process it in chunks if it gets too big basically. We can just process it all in chunks if it gets too big to load it into memory. I think we probably want to store Sorry. I think we probably want to store um a hierarchical information density as well. So like an informan mation density score for each meeting and each topic segment. 'Cause otherwise we'd be recalculating the same thing over and over and over again. Yeah. And that will obviously make it much easier to display. Well it may not for the whole meeting, but like Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Well, we can start off like that. Well I was gonna start off I've v got sort of half-way through implementing one that does just I_D_F_. And then just I can change that to work on whatever. Yeah. And it should be weighted by stuff like the hot spots and um the key-words in the search and stuff like that. Did he not say something about named entities? So I thought he said there wasn't very many. Yeah. Yeah. It's not T_F_I_D_F_, it's just inverse document frequency. 'Cause it's really easy to do basically. There's just like for a baseline really. Well, I'm half-way through. It's not working yet, but it will do. Um yeah. And then averaging it over the utterances. But it's not like um related to the corpus at all. It's just working on an arbitrary text file at the moment. No. It would be useful to know how everyone's gonna store their things though. Yeah. Yeah. Well I've got like a few hours free. Like after this. It's the most boring task. Yeah. Or at least um simple versions of them. So maybe we should try doing something really simple, like just displaying a whole meeting. And like just being able to scroll through it or something like that. Yeah. Are you free after this? How about Friday then. 'Cause I'm off all Friday. Uh Wednesday I've got a nine 'til twelve. Yeah, nothing in the afternoon. I've got nothing in the afternoon. So Okay. So you ha yeah. Where about, just in Appleton Tower? Uh I'll be in um the Appleton Tower anyway. Um well I'll be there from twelve. I've got some other stuff that needs done on Matlab, so if you're not there at twelve, I can just work on that. So Yeah. Why w Yeah. I'm just building a dictionary. Oh, mine's just gonna use the um hash map one in um Java. 'Cause I'm only gonna do it on small documents. It's just like bef until the information density is up and running. Just something to get give me something to work with. So it's only gonna use quite small documents, you see, to start with. Why does it need to be classified into like different segments? Can we just fill a second class with junk that we don't care about? Like, I don't know, copies of Shakespeare or something. 'Cause if what we're looking for is the um frequency statistics, I don't see how that would be changed by the classification. I the Well there maybe another tool available? Yeah. Um I can't remember who's got it. Might be WordNet. But one of these big corpuses has a list of stop words that you can download and they're just basically lists of really uninteresting boring words that we could filter out before we do that. It's like that's one the papers I read, that's um one things they did right at the beginning is they've got this big s stop-list and they just ignore all of those throughout the experiment. Yeah, I it would be useful for me as well. It uh I think that'd be useful for me as well. Yeah. Yeah. Well all you really wanna do is look into getting some sub-set of the ICSI corpus off the DICE machines. 'Cause I hate working on DICE. It's awful. Like so I can use my home machine. ha has a C_D_ burner though. has a C_D_ burner. Yeah. The right-hand corner, far right. Yeah. How big is it without um the WAV files and stuff? 'Cause I could just say at um going over S_C_P_ one night and just leave it going all night if I had to. It's yeah, I mean the wave data are obviously not gonna get off there completely. Really? Oh right? I'll see if I can S_C_P_ it, I suppose. I've got a Linux box and a Windows box. So Broad-band. Put it on to C_D_. I can if I get down I can put to C_D_. Yeah. I'm not sure if there's enough space. Is how much do we get? Really? Okay. Yeah, but I can do it from that session, can't I? You can compress it from a remote session and S_C_P_ it from the same session? Do you think? Yeah. Oh no no, I was thinking of SSHing just into some machine and then just SCPing it from there. Yeah. I mean it has to go through the gateway. But Can you not do that? Mm, I see. Yeah. So you could just But th first, uh how big are the chunks? How big are the chunks you're looking at? So quite small then. So you could just um you could use just the same thing we used to build the big dictionary. You just do that on-line 'cause that won't take long to build a little dictionary that big, will it. I mean just use the same tool that we use. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't need ordered, no. Um well that's the t are you using T_F_I_D_F_ for the information density? Alright, okay. Like 'cause frequency would be useful, I think. But um depending on the context, the size, and what we consider a document in the sense of calculating T_F_I_D_F_ is gonna change. Which might need thinking about. I think it would be useful, yeah. Well you need the raw frequency as well. But um you also need how many times things occur within each document. And um what we consider a document's gonna depend on our context, I think. 'Cause if we're looking at the whole lot of meetings, we'll consider each meeting a document in sort of terms of this algorithm. And if we're viewing like say just a small topic segment you might look at even each utterance as a small document. Yeah, but the thing is um It's gonna need some th th thought of how we Actually maybe it doesn't actually matter. Maybe if you just do it once at the highest level, it it will be fine. But I was just thinking it might be difficult to calculate the T_F_I_D_F_ off-line for all the different levels we might want. 'Cause if we're gonna allow disjoint segments for example, then how are we gonna know what's gonna be in context at any given time? But I suppose if you just did it globally, treating a meeting as a document, it'd probably still be work out fine, because you'd only be comparing to ones within the context. Uh I don't know, I thought were you gonna use that in the end? The information density. Oh sorry, that's what I mean. Like um yeah, for each word or whatever, but across the whole lot is what I mean by highest level. Like across the whole corpus. Yeah, but you'd probably look at each meeting as a document. Mm possibly. Are they big enough to get anything meaningful out of? Well yeah, that is not it's not an issue. You just concatenate an X_M_L_ file together. but we still want to have like a notion of meetings for the user. Yeah, sure. Yeah, you just like whatever you want to look at, you just jam together into an X_M_L_ file and that's your meeting, even though bits of it may come from all over the place or whatever. I mean I don't see why that's really a big problem. So basically what you're saying is you can take an arbitrary amount of data and process it with the same algorithm. It doesn't matter conceptually what that data is. It could be a meeting. it could be two utterances. it could be a meeting plus half a meeting from somewhere else. I don't think it's very difficult though. I mean what you do is you just build an X_M_L_ file, and if you want it to get down to the utterances, you'd go to the leaves. And then if you wanted the next level up, you'd go to the parents of those and like just go from like the leaves inwards towards the branch to build up things like um you know, when you click on a segment, it's gonna have like words or whatever that are important. As long as like the algorithms are designed um with it in mind, I don't think it's a very big problem. Well like say you had um like say for a meeting, right, you've got like uh say a hierarchy that looks quite big, like this. And like the utterances come off of here maybe. Then when whatever your algorithm is doing, as long as when you're working with utterances, you go for all the leaves, like then if you need something next up, so like a topic segment, you'd go to here. But if you were looking at say this one, so only went like this. Right, so you it's same, you'd start with the leaves, and you go oh, I want a topic segment. So I go one layer up. See, and then if you're working with just a topic segment in there, it's the only thing you have to worry about. And like each time you want a higher level, you just need to go up the tree. And as long as your algorithm respects that, then we can just process any arbitrary X_M_L_ file with whatever hierarchical structure we want. A meeting, say, and that would be a topic segment. So I think as long as you build an algorithm that respects whatever structure's in the file, rather than imposing its own structure Well no, it doesn't have to be. But I mean it could be as many nodes as you want. Like this one could be deeper maybe, say. So then you'd start with all your utterances here, and when you go up to get topic segments, you go to here here here here here here here. That might be a bit confusing though 'cause you have things on different levels. Well Wednesday. Yeah. Yeah. So we'll see if we can get like a mini-browser just displays two things synched together of some kind. Yeah. Yeah. It'd be useful. I don't know who you see about that though. I d have no idea. I've probably got a reasonable amount because um everything on my DICE account can actually be deleted 'cause I store it all at home as well. Is that guaranteed to stay, the Maybe you should send a support form. Just say we want some web space. Listen to. Yeah. 'Cause that'd be really useful is if we had a big directory. Especially for transferring stuff. Having said that, are we allowed to take a copy of the ICSI corpus? Something we should probably ask before we do it.. Okay. Okay. No, me neither. Might be funny to see what is summarised the whole corpus as anyway. I think it'd be very useful. But We can just change the code. Is that it? That's quite good. Yeah. I could just use it with the frequency, I think, until the information density thing's finished. That would be really useful. If you're doing it in Java, could you um serialize the output as well as writing it to a file? If you're doing it in Java, could you serialize the um dictionary, yeah, as well as writing it to a file? It's really easy. I don't see why it'd be any more massive than the file. Yeah. It just saves you parsing the um file representation of it. And now 'cause I would be using it in Java anyway. So I'd just be building the data structure again. Yeah, but it seems like a bit silly to be parsing it over and over again kinda thing. I would've thought that um I think all the collections and things implement serializable already. I think they might do. Tonight I'll try and um I'll either work some more on uh the T_F_I_D_F_ summarizer or do the audio thing. Yeah. Do we have to demonstrate something next week? Yeah. Yeah, I know. I think it's 'cause we had to specify it ourselves that it's not as um like focus the specification of most um work we have to do. Yeah. Once we start doing it it will all become more or less obvious I think anyway.
Okay. Does anyone want to see uh Steve's feedback from the specification? Right. Not really, um just what he's talking about, like duplication of effort and Like duplication of effort and stuff, and um yeah, he was saying that we should maybe uh think about having a prototype for week six, which is next week. Yeah. So we should probably prioritize our packages. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Has has anyone actually looked at the Java code for the, huh? Hmm. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I I don't know about the search functionality, that might be online. Depends how it's gonna work. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that makes sense. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, you just concatenate them together. Hmm. Yeah. It just means it loads on demand. It only loads when it needs a particular type of file. Like when it's being accessed. Yeah, I think that's the idea, it just loads the particular ones it needs. But if you were doing a search over the whole corpus you'd have to load them all. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Yeah, we do not want it in to develop a little tree display as well for multiple results. Yeah, but that'd be quite easy to do. You just need to find the time stamp. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think I think those segments for each utterance are split up. Think so. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's already there. Pretty sure that's already there. The the utterances are numbered. Hmm. Yeah, I think so. Ye that's the impression I get, yeah. Oh. Hmm. Ye Mm. Yeah, uh Right. Okay. Topics, yeah. Yeah, I think that's the right one. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Hmm. Yeah, that'd be much more efficient to do that. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, you're able to do that in Java, yeah? Yeah. Huh. Hmm. Yeah, I've had a b I've had a look at the the topic segments, how it's stored. And then yeah, th those are few per meeting, and it um well, it gives a time stamp and inside each one there's uh the actual like utterance segments. And the list of them that occurred. And they're all numbered. Um so that's where that's stored. Yeah, so I guess um if I'm gonna be segmenting it with a L_C_ seg then that's like same format I'd want to um put it back out in so it'd be equivalent. Well, like the integration. What do you mean, integration? Hmm. I don't know. I don't think anyone's been allocated to do that yet. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, definitely. Hmm, yeah. Yeah, it c could be difficult, yeah. Yeah. Well I guess the important thing is to get the crucial m modules built. Ye yeah. Yeah, and then Yeah, and then we'll maybe have to prioritize somebody into just integrating it. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think so. Uh yeah. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Jasmine, I thought you just said that you'd uh looked at extracting the text. Yeah. So you you said you did it in Python, yeah? Yeah, did you use uh b the X_L_ uh X_M_L_ parser in Python? Right. Yeah, sounds pretty good. So um 'cause, yeah, I was having a look in it a look at it as well and I noticed the um the speakers are all in that separate file? So did did you have to combine them all and and then re-order them? Yeah. Ye yeah, c Right. Yeah, so that's approach um well, I was going to do. So yeah, we may as well collaborate. In the word files? I'm not sure I what you mean. Oh right. Hmm. Hmm. Mm I thought they were local to th a particular meeting. Hmm. Mm is there anything else we should discuss? Yeah, should we not have like a group directory or something where we can put all our code in and that kinda thing? Hmm. I've gotten mm hardly any Hmm. Yeah, we can ask Steve if um we can get space. Yeah, uh we could do that. Yeah, I'm sure he had to deal with that last year. Yeah. Hmm. That sounds good. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna need. Yes. Yeah, it's just mo changing it a bit. Yeah. No, but uh that's what M_L_C_ seg does. It it marks the end of each segment. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, for me it's better if they're by meeting. Then that'll be really easy to do once they've got the raw text. It's just a case of running the script. Yeah, I mean hopefully this week. Alright. And we could Don't know. Suppose we're just getting on with all our components. So I know. Wa Yeah. Yeah, he suggested that we could have an uh initial prototype. I know, I'd b I'd be surprised if we can get anything working by next week. Alright.
'Kay. Gosh. 'Kay. Is there much more in it than he d Is there much more in it than he said yesterday? Mm. Hmm. Hmm? Yeah, now I'd say if for the prototype if we just like wherever possible p chunk in the stuff that we have um pre-annotated and stuff, and for the stuff that we don't have pre-annotated write like a stupid baseline, then we should probably be able to basically that means we focus on on the interface first sort of, so that we we take the the ready-made parts and just see how we get them work together in the interface the way we want and and then we have a working prototype. And then we can go back and replace pieces either by our own components or by more sophisticated compo po components of our own. So it's probably feasible. The thing is I'm away this weekend. So that's for me Oh yeah, um yeah. No. But also I might like the the similarity thing, like my just my matrix itself for my stuff, I c I I think I can do that fairly quickly because I have the algorithms. Yeah, I think today's meeting is really the one where we where we sort of settle down the data structure and as soon as we have that, uh probably like after today's meeting, we then actually need to well go back first of all and look at NITE X_M_L_ to see in how far that that which we want is compatible with that which NITE X_M_L_ offers us. And then just sort of everyone make sure everyone understand the interface. So I think if today we decide on what data we wanna have now, and and later, maybe even today, we go and look at NITE X_M_L_ or some of us look at NITE X_M_L_ in a bit more detail, just trying to make some sense of that code and see how does the representation work in their system. And then sort of with that knowledge we should be able to then say okay, that type of NITE X_M_L_ data we wanna load into it, and this is how everyone can access it, and then we should be able to go from there. No. I've looked looked at the documentation and n like seen enough to make me think that we want to use the NITE X_M_L_ framework because um they have a good a event model that synchronizes sort of the data and and every display element. So that takes a lot of work away from us. Sort of that would be a reason for staying within their framework and using their general classes. But beyond that I haven't looked at it at all, which is something we should really do. Who actually like for this whole discussion I mean, who of us is doing stuff that is happening on-line and who of us is doing stuff that's happening off-line? Like my data is coming c Hmm? Yeah. Okay. Okay. 'Kay. So basically apart from the display module, the i the display itself, we don't have an extremely high degree of interaction between sort of our modules that create the stuff and and the interface, so the interface is mainly while it's running just working on data that's just loaded from a file, I guess. There isn't Yeah, I know. Th Yeah, the search is I guess the search is sort of a strange beast anyway because for the search we're leaving the NITE X_M_L_ framework. Um but that's still sort of that's good. That means that at least like we don't have the type of situation where somebody has to do like a billion calculations on on data on-line. 'Cause that would make it a lot more like that would mean that our interface for the data would have to be a lot more careful about how it performs and and everything. And nobody is modifying that data at at on-line time at all it seems. Nobody's making any changes to the actual data on-line. So that's actually making it a lot easier. That basically means our browser really is a viewer mostly, which isn't doing much with the data except for sort of selecting a piece piece of it and and displaying it. Hmm? Well some parts relevant for the search, yes. I'd say so. Hmm? Yeah, but nobody of us is doing much of searching from the data in the on-line stage. And for all together, like the display itself, I think we are easier if we if it's sitting on the X_M_L_ than if it's sitting on the S_Q_L_ stuff, because if it's sitting on the X_M_L_, we have the the NITE X_M_L_ framework with all its functionality for synchronizing through all the different levels whenever there's a change, whenever something's moving forward and stuff. And we can just more or less look at their code, like how their player moves forward, and how that moving forward is represented in different windows and stuff. So I think in the actual browser itself I don't wanna sit on the S_Q_L_ if we can sit on the X_M_L_ because sitting on the X_M_L_ we have all we have so much help. And for y for like the p the calculations that we're doing apart from the search, it seems that everyone needs some special representations anyway. You mean our results? Yeah, in in the NITE X_M_L_ X_M_L_ format, so with their time stamps and stuff, so that it's easy to to tie together st things. What I'm like what we have to think about is if we go with this multi-level idea, like this idea that sort of if you start with a whole meeting series as one entity, as one thing that you display, as one whole sort of, that then the individual chunks of the individual meetings, whereas and then you can click on a meeting, and then sort of the meeting is the whole thing and the chunks are the individual segments, that means sort of we have multiple levels of of representation, which we probably If we if we do it this way like we f we have to discuss that if we do it this way, then we should probably find some abstraction model, so that the interface in the sense like deals with it as if it's same so that the interface doesn't really have to worry whether it's a meeting in the whole meeting series or a segment within a meeting, you know what I mean? And that's probably stuff that we have to sort of like process twice then. Like for example that like the summary of a meeting within the whole meeting corpus or meeting series y is meeting series a good word for that? I don't really know what how to call it. You know what I mean, like not not the whole corpus, but every meeting that has to do with one topic. Um so in in the meeting se series so that a summary for a meeting within the meeting series, are sort of compiled off-line by a summary module. And that is separate from a summary of a segment within a meeting. 'Cause I don't think we can So are we doing that at all levels? Are we um And just have different like fine-grainedness levels sort of. Mm. 'Kay. So the only thing that yeah, so the only thing that would happen basically if I double-click let's say from the whole meeting series on a single meeting, is that the zoom level changes. Like the th the start and the end position changes and the zoom level changes. I I thought we couldn't do that. Like I was under the impression that we couldn't do that because we couldn't load the data for all that. But I don't know, I mean that So I'm s not sure if I got it. I was Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. So Okay. I wa I was just worried about the total memory complexity of it. But I I completely admit, I mean, I just sort of like th took that from some thing that Jonathan once said about not loading everything. But maybe I was just wrong about it. How many utterances w Yeah, and I w yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what we have is we would have a word. Like we would have words with some priority levels. And they would basically be because even the selection would would the summaries automatically feed from just how prioritized an individual word or how indiv uh prioritized an individual utterance is? Or i are the summaries sort of refined from it and made by a machine to make sentences and stuff? Or are they just sort of taking out the words with the highest priority and then the words of the second highest priority? And the u okay. Are we doing it on th the whole thing on the utterance level? Or are we doing it on word level, like the information density calculation? We I think we have start and end times for words actually, but it's yeah, but it m it might s but it might sound crazy in the player. We should really maybe we can do that together at some point today that we check out how the player works. But there's maybe some merit in altogether doing it on an utterance level in the end. So Yeah. Well but also about the displays, I mean the displays in the in the text body, in the in the latest draft that we had sort of we came up with the idea that it isn't displaying utterance for utterance, but it's also displaying uh a summarised version in you know, like below the below the graph, the part. Maybe Yeah, r Hmm? Oh yeah, f it's just like there there's like audio skimming and there's displayed skimming. Yeah. Ma maybe there's some merit of going altogether for utterance level and not even bother to calculate I mean if you have to do it internally, then you can do it. But maybe like not even store the importance levels for individual words and just sort of rank utterances as a whole. Hmm? Yeah. 'Cause it it might be better skimming and less memory required at the same time. And I mean if you if you know how to do it for individual words, then you can just in the worst case, if you can't find anything else, just sort of make the mean of the words over the utterance. You know what I mean? W it's it's Well what's the smallest chunk at the moment you're thinking of of assigning an importance measure to, is it a word or is it an utterance? So we're thinking of like maybe just storing it on a per utterance level. Because it's it's less stuff to store probably for Dave in the in the audio playing. And for in the display it's probably better if you have whole utterances than I don't know, like what it's like if you just take single words out of utterances. That probably doesn't make any sense at all, whereas if you just uh show important utterances but the utterance as a whole it makes more sense. So it doesn't actually make a difference for your algorithm, 'cause it just means that if you're working on a word level, then we just mean it over the utterance. They are on Oh so that's good anyway then, yeah. Because that makes it a lot easier than to t put it on utterance level. Oh yeah. No but I mean like how how Jasmine does it internally I don't know, but it's probably, yeah, you probably have to work on word levels for importance. But there should be ways of easily going from a word level to an utterance level. Okay. Yeah, prob Hmm. Well we do a pre-filtering of sort of the whole thing, sort of like but that, like the problem with that is it's easy to do in the text level. But that would mean it would still play the uh in your audio, unless we sort of also store what pieces we cut out for the audio. Yeah. I think before we can like answer that specific question how we c deal with that, it's probably good for us to look at what the audio player is capable of doing. Yes. So what do you mean by buffering? Like you think directly feeding But yeah, but not but not stored on the hard disk and then loaded in, but loaded in directly from memory. But it's probably a stream if it exists in Java, it would be probably some binary stream going in of some type. Okay, yeah. Okay. Okay, so I mean so that means that there's probably, even if you go on an per utterance level, there's still some merit on within utterances cutting out stuff which clearly isn't relevant at all, and that maybe also for the audio we'd have to do. So let's say we play the whole au phrase, but then in addition to that, we have some information that says minus that part of something. That's okay, that we can do. Yeah, maybe even I mean that's sort of that depends on how how advanced we get. If maybe if we realise that there's massive differences in in gain or in something, you can probably just make some simple simple normalization, but that really depends on how much time we have and and how much is necessary. Yeah, if like I d I don't know anything about audio and I have never seen the player. So if you find that the player accepts some n input from memory, and if it's easy to do, then I guess that's that's fairly doable. So but that means in the general structure we're actually quite lucky, so we we have we load into memory for the whole series of meetings just the utterances and rankings for the utterances and some information probably that says, well, the I guess that goes with the utterance, who's speaking. Because then we can also do the display about who's speaking. Yeah. But I'm I'm still confused 'cause I thought like that's just what Jonathan said we do c that we can't do, like load a massive document of that size. On the other hand The other hand, I mean it shouldn't be like should be like fifty mega-byte in RAM or something, it shouldn't be massive, should it? Actually fifty hundred megabyte is quite big in RAM. Just thinking, what's the simp so We do get an error message with the project if we load everything into the project with all the data they load. So we know that doesn't work. So our hope is essentially that we load less into it. What's this lazy loading thing, somebody explain lazy loading to me. Ah, okay. So that is that only by type of file. Like if if if the same thing is in different files, would it then maybe like, you know, if if utterances are split over three or ten or w hundred different files, is then a chance maybe that it doesn't try to load them all into memory at the same time, but just So why does it fail then in the first place? Then it shouldn't ever fail, because then it should never Yeah, but yeah, but um it uh it it failed right when you load it, right, the NITE X_M_L_ kit, so that's interesting. Hmm. Let's check that out. Um I'll p I'll probably ask Jonathan about it. So alternatively, if we realise we can't do the whole thing in one go, we can probably just process some sort of meta-data, you know what I mean, like sort of sort of for the whole series chunks representing the individual meetings or some Like something that represents the whole series in in a v in a structure very similar to the structure in which we represent individual um meetings, but with data sort of always combined from the whole series. so instead of having an single utterance that we display, it would probably be like that would be representing a whole um topic, a segment in a meeting. And sort of so that wi using the same data st Well, in a sense Uh I'm I'm thinking of in a sense of like creating a virtual a virtual meeting out of the whole meeting series, sort of. Yeah, sort of like off-line create a virtual meeting, which which basically treats the meeting series as if it was a meeting, and treats the individual meetings within the series as if they were segments, and treats the individual segments within meetings as if they were um utterances. You know, so we just sort of we shift it one level up. And in that way we could probably use the same algorithm and just like make vir like one or two ifs that say okay, if you are on a whole document uh a whole series level and that was a double-click, then don't just go into that um segment, but load a new file or something like it, but in general use the same algorithm. That would be an alternative if we can't actually load the whole thing and 'Cause also like even if we maybe this whole like maybe I'm worrying too much about the whole series in one thing display, because actually I mean probably users wouldn't view that one too often. Yeah, but I'm I'm still worried. Like for example for the display, if you actually if you want a display uh like for the whole series, the information density levels based on and and the f and the only granularity you have is individual utterances, that means you have to through every single utterance in a series of seventy hours of meetings. Yeah. Yeah, and if you make that structurally very similar to the the le like one level down, like the way how we uh store individual utterances and stuff, then maybe we can more or less use the same code and just make a few ifs and stuff. Yeah, so so but still so in in general we're having we're having utterances and they have a score. And that's as much as we really need. And of cou and they also have a time a time information of course. Hmm? And a and a s and a speaker information, yeah. Yeah, so an information which topic they're in, yeah. And and probably separate to that an information about the different topics like that Yeah. So so the skimming can work on that because the skimming just sort of sorts the utterances and puts as many in as it needs Yeah. Yeah, it'll it'll play them in some order in which they were set because otherwise it's gonna be more entertaining. Um but that that's enough data for the skimming and the the searching, so what the searching does is the searching leaves the whole framework, goes to the S_Q_L_ database and gets like basically in the end gets just a time marker for where that is, like that utterance that we are concerned with. And then we have to find I'm sure there's some way in in NITE X_M_L_ to just say set position to that time mark. And then it shifts the whole frame and it alerts every single element of the display and the display updates. Yeah, yeah. That we can ju yeah, but so so if if somethi so yeah. So if in that tree display somebody clicks on something Yeah, and then you sort of feed the time stamp to and the NITE X_M_L_ central manager, and that central manager alerts everything that's there, like alerts the skim like the the audio display, alerts the text display, alerts the visual display and says we have a new time frame and then they all sort of do their update routines with respect to the current level of zoom. So how much do they display, and starting position at where the or maybe the mid-position of it, I don't know, like w if start where the thing was found or if that thing wa was found it's in the middle of the part that we display, that I don't know. But that we can decide about, but a general sort of It's the same thing if like whether you play and it moves forward or whether you jump to a position through search, it's essentially for all the window handling, it's the same event. It's only that the event gets triggered by the search routine which sort of push that into NITE X_M_L_ and says please go there now. Why do we have to do it in memory? But that stuff's so I mean like the information is coming from off-line. So we probably we don't even have to change the utterance document, right, because the whole way, like the whole beauty of the NITE X_M_L_ is that it ties together lots of different files. So we can just create an additional X_M_L_ file which for every utterance like the utterances have I_D_s I presume, some references. So we just we tie uh p just a very short X_M_L_ file, which it's the only information it has that has whatever a number for for the um weight, for the information density, and we just tie that to the existing utterances and tie them to the existing speaker changes. Well otherwise we probably have to go over it and like add some integer that we just increment from top to bottom sort of to every utterance as an as an I_D_ some type. Or un or try to understand how NITE X_M_L_ I_D_s work and maybe there's some special route we have to follow when we use these I_D_s. It's alm hmm? Yeah, the the girl said the utterances themselves are not numbered at the moment. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So I guess that would be solvable if not. Mm-hmm. Sorry? Okay. Okay. Is that a board marker pen actually? Oh. That's just so like to make a list of all this stuff, or we probably can somebody can do it on paper. All these fancy pens. So what so the stuff we have we have utterances and speakers and weights for utterances. So for for every utterance sort of like the utterance has a speaker and a weight which is coming from outside. Or we just tie it to it. And there is segments, which hmm? Oh, so sorry um. Uh topic s topic segments I meant. Like they are they are a super-unit. So so the utterances are tied to topic segments. And if the time stamps are on a word level, then we b somehow have to extract time stamps for utterances where they start. W what segments now? Okay. Is the uh is that the same as utterances that is that the same as utterances that Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. What so that's Oh. But that's one o one segment or is that two segments then? Yeah. Okay. Okay. So but but generally utterances is that which we just called uh sorry, segments is that which we just called utterances now. Like it's it's the sa it's sort of like one person's contribution at a time sort of thingy dingy. Okay, so yeah, so we have those, and and then we have some f field somewhere else which has topics. Yeah, and and a topic's basically they are just on the I_D_, probably with a start time or something, and and the utterances referenced to those topics I guess. So the topics don't contain any redundant thing of like showing the whole topic again, but they just sort of say a number and where they start and where they finish. And the utterances then say which topic they belong to. Yeah. No. But I was thinking of the topic segmentation now and and f for that there would only be one, right, because it's sort of like it's just a time window. Yeah. So if this lazy loading works, then this should definitely fit into I mean not memory then because it wouldn't all be in memory at the same time. So if we just have those sort of that information like a long list of all the utterances slash segments and like short or smaller lists which give weight to them. And even though probably if there's a lot of over-head in having two different files, we can probably merge the weights into it off-line. You know what I mean, like if if there's a lot of bureaucracy involved with having two different trees and whether one ties to the other because the one has the weight for the other, then it's probably quicker to just Yeah, I thought that was the whole beauty that like you can just make a new X_M_L_ file and sort of tie that to the other and and it tre Oh yeah. So no, I didn't I didn't mean tree. No. No. I meant just like handling two different files internally. Sort of c I was just thinking you know like if if the overhead for having the same amount of data coming from two d files instead of from one file is massive then it would probably be for us easy to just like off-line put the the weight into into the file that has the segments, uh yeah, segments slash utterances already. But that we can figure out I mean if it's going horrendously wrong. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, we'd we'd be completely using like the whole infrastructure and basically just I mean the main difference really between our project and theirs really is that we load a different part of the data. But otherwise we're doing it the same way that they are doing it. So we just we're sort of running different types of queries on it. We in a sense we I think we are running queries, it's not just about um what we load and what we don't load, but we're l running queries in the sense that we dynamically select by by weights, don't we? That we have to check how fast that is, like to say give us all the ones that whether that works with their query language, whether that's too many results and whether we shou You know, if 'cause if it i let's say I mean if if their query language is strange and if it would return b ten million results and it can't handle it, then we can just write our individual components in the way that they know which what the threshold is. So they still get all the data and just they internally say oh no, this is less than three and I'm not gonna display it or something. Hmm? Yeah. No. I'm just thinking for this whole thing of like a different level, sort of cutting out different different pieces, whether we do that through a query where we say give us everything that's ab above this and this weight, or whether we skip the same infrastructure, but every individual module like the player and the display say like they still get sort of all the different utterances, uh all the different pieces, but they say oh, this piece I leave out, because it's below the current threshold level. When do we need the one for the meet Okay. Yeah, I guess for the so when we have the display, will we display the whole series. Then if we have for the individual topic segments within the meetings if we have ready calculated disp um measures, then we don't have to sort of extract that data from the individual utterances. Yeah, and that's also fairly easy to store along with our segments, isn't it. For the segments, are we extracting some type of title for them that we craft with some fancy algorithm or manually or we're just taking the single most highly valued key-word utterance for the segment heading? Hmm. Hmm. It's probably like in in the end probably it wouldn't be the best thing if it's just the high most highly ranked phrase or key-word because like for example for an introduction that would most definitely not be anything that has any title anywhere similar to introduction or something. Yeah. Also like for this part, maybe if we go over it with named entity in the end, if I mean w if one of the people doing DIL has some named entity code to spare, and just like at least for the for sort of for finding topics, titles for for segments, just take a named entity which has a really high, what's it called, D_F_I_D_F_, whatever. 'Cause you'd probably be quite likely if they're talking about a conference or a person, that that would be a named entity which is very highly fr um frequented in that part. Yeah, he said they're quite sparse. So that basically was don't bother basing too much of your general calculation on it. But like especially if they're sparse, probably individual named entities which describe what a what a segment is about would probably be quite good. Like if there's some name of some conference, they would could probably say that name of the conference quite often, even though he's right that they make indirect references to it. Anyway Sorry? So you're doing that on a on a per word level. Okay. Okay. Okay, cool. I was just wondering where you had the corpus from at the moment. So it it seems that the data structure isn't a big problem and that basically we don't have to have all these massive discussions of how we exactly interact with the data structure because most of our work isn't done with that data structure in memory in the browser, but it's just done off-line and everyone can ha represent it anyway they want as long as they sort of store it in a useful X_M_L_ representation in the end. So like Yeah, that would mean understanding the NITE X_M_L_ X_M_L_ sort of format in a lot more detail. We should I think we should just have a long session in the computer room together and like now that we know a bit more what we want, take a closer look at NITE X_M_L_. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Good. Yeah, I haven't looked at this stuff much at all. Yeah. Yeah. Who's who's sort of doing the the the central coordination of of of the browser application now? Like Hmm? Yeah, or but also like all these elements like like the loading and, yeah, integration and and like handling the data loading and stuff. Nah. I'm sort of like I think I'll take over the display, just because I've started with a bit and found it found it doable. So somebody should sort of be the one person who's who understands most about what's t centrally going on with with the with the project, like with the with the browser as a whole and where the data comes in and Any volunteers? It's also a complicated one. Yeah. I know but uh b I guess we can do it like several people together, it's probably just those people have to work together a lot and very closely and just make sure that they're always f understand what the other one is doing. Yeah, or or ready-made versions of them for that matter and Yeah, but I think actually like at the moment the integration comes first, I mean it's sort of at the moment the building the browser comes first, and then only comes the creating new sophisticated data chunks, because that's sort of the whole thing about having a prototype system which is more or less working on on chunk data. But it at least we have the framework in which we can then test everything and and look at everything. 'Cause before we have that, it's gonna be very difficult for anyone to really see how much the work that they're doing is making sense because you just well I guess you can see something from the data that you have in your individual X_M_L_ s files files that you create, but it would be nice to have some basic system which just displays some stuff. Or just adapt like their like just sort of go from their system and and adapt that piece for piece and see how we could how we could arran like adapt it to our system. Does anyone want to like just sit with me and like play for three hours with NITE X_M_L_ at some point? Uh I wouldn't like to be 'cause I'd like to go to the gym. I'm theoretically free. But if there's any time t hmm? You have nothing no free time on Wednesday. Hmm. Nine 'til twelve and then nothi you have or you Hmm? Anytime Wednesday afternoon I'd be cool, I think. Yo, Forrest Hill, whatever one's easier to discuss stuff, I don't know. I'm not biased. Okay. What time do you wanna do? Okay, so I'll just meet you in in eighteen a in the afternoon. I guess at the moment nobody critically depends on like the NITE X_M_L_ stuff working right now, right? Like at the moment you can all do your stuff and I can do my L_S_A_ stuff. And I can even do the display to a vast degree without actually having their supplying framework working. So it's not that crucial. Yeah, actually I need the raw text as well. Yeah, but I was I was I was more thinking of the sort of the the whole browser framework as a running programme now. Yeah, I think we all need the raw text in different in different flavours, don't we? But number within the X_M_L_ context. Are they spoken numbers? Like do they look like they're utterances numbers? There's the number task, isn't there. That's part of the whole thing. Hmm? Okay. Hmm. Yeah, we have to probably cut that out anyway for our project, I don't know. It's probably gonna screw up a lot of our data otherwise. If Not sure if it what it does to document It would probably make the yeah, if if you have segments for that, probably the Okay. Uh I'm just thinking like it pro it pro probably like the L_S_A_ would perform quite well on it. It would probably find another number task quite easily seeing that it's a constrained vocabulary with a high co-occurrence of the same nine words. So that wou ten word. Hmm? Yeah. I think it's also something that they they said the numbers in order, right? Yeah, I think it's it the it sounded like they wanted to check out how well they were doing with overlapping and stuff, because basically it's like they're reading them at different speeds, but you know in which order they are said. Anyway. ICSI has some reasons for doing it. They must have been pissed off saying like numbers at the end of every meeting. Um Dave, if you would or actually for well, if you're doing I_D_F_s or you whatever you call your your frequencies, I always mix up the name, uh you need some dictionary for that at some point though, like you need to have some representation of a word as not not that specific occurrence of that word token, but of of of a given word form. Because you're making counts for word forms, right? Yeah, so we should work together on that, because I need a dictionary as well. Okay. 'Kay. Okay. Didn't you say that the o the ord Yeah, but for I'm just wondering for the whole thing. Does somebody wo who was it of you two who said that um there's some programme which spits out a dictionary probably with frequencies? Okay. Is anyone of you for the for the document frequency over total frequency, you gonna have total frequencies of words then with that, right? Like over the whole corpus sort of. Or W using which tool are you talking about? Be careful with that. Like my experience with the British National Corpus was that there's far more word types than you ever think because anything that's sort of unusual generally is a new word type. Like any typo or any strange thing where they put two words together. And also any number as a word type of its own. So you can easily end up with hundred thousands of words when you didn't expect them. So generally dictionaries can grow bigger then you think they do. Well you can probably also you can probably pre-filter like with regular expressions even just say if it consists of only dig digits, then skip it, or even if it consists any special characters, then skip it because it's probably something with a dot in between, which is usually not something you wanna have and What I did, for my project I just ignored the hundred most frequent words, because they actually end up all being articles and and everything and stuff. So we need like several of us need a dictionary. Am I the only one who needs it with frequencies? Am I the only one who needs it with frequencies? Or Frequencies. Yeah. Well I guess as soon as we have the raw text, we can probably just start with the Java hash map and like just hash map over it and see how far we get. I mean we can probably on a machine with a few hundred megabyte RAM you can go quite far. You can write it on beefy. So even if it goes wrong and even if it has a million words be Oh yeah, burning it on a like we should be able to burn the whole corpus, just the X_ hmm? Ah I see, I asked support about that two days ago. In the Informatics building there oh sorry, in in Appleton Tower five the ones closest t two machines closest to the support office. So I presume oh wait, I have the exact email. I think he's talking about sort of the ones that Yeah, if you if you enter the big room, in the right-hand corner, I think. Um the thing is like you can only burn from the local file-system. So if it's from s well actually I think if it's mounted, you can directly burn from there, but the problem is I have my data on beefy and so I have to get it into the local temp directory and burn it from there. But you can burn it from there. Uh we looked that up and I for we looked that up and I forgot. Yeah yeah. No, you you we should be able to get it at I don't think it was I don't think it was a gigabyte. Hmm. See I would off I would offer you to to get it on this one, and then um like copy it. But you know what I figured out, I'm quicker down-loading over broad-band into my computer than using this hard disk. There's something strange about the way how they access the hard disk, how they mount it, which is unfortunate. Hmm. What operating system do you have? Okay. Wh what connection do you have at home? Yeah. So if anyone of us gets it, we can then just use an ext hmm? Yeah, burn it to C_D_ or, yeah, put it on on hard disk, whatever. Question is if you're not quicker if you uh because you should get massive compression out of that. Like fifty percent or something with a good algorithm. So if you could compress it and just put it into a temp directory. Like The temp the temps usually have for gigabyte three or two. The temps, yeah. I do like I mean there's not guarantee that anything stays there, but overnight it'll stay. And I think the temps usually have. Ah yeah, but that would have to be the temp directory off the machine you can S_S_H_ into directory of S_S_H_. Yeah, they wou they'd they'd probably hate you for doing it. But They'd probably they'd like you more if you S_S_H_ uh into another computer, compress it there and then sort of copy it into the into the gateway machine. They have um if you S_S_ hey, you know, if you if you S_S_H_ and they have this big warning about doing nothing at all in the gateway machine. Yeah. To your home machine. I haven't I haven't figured out how to tunnel through the gateway into another machine yet. It's not it's not easy definitely. That's why I end up sort of copying stuff into the temp directory at the gateway machine. Sorry if this is boring everybody else. This is just details and how to get stuff home from what we can probably just look at that together when we're meeting. I'm sorry. Mm-hmm. Well yeah. As soon as somebody gives me the raw text of the whole thing, I can probably just implement like a five line Java hash table frequency dictionary builder and see Oh, did you not say frequencies f of words in the whole sorry, did uh So you'd you Yeah, you'd have to count it yourself, yeah. Oh, you don't wanna have different counts for each chunk, but just like sort of for for something from old chunks. Oh yeah, no, that's yeah, so once I write an ar like w if I write like an algorithm which does a hash um table dictionary with frequency from a raw text, then the raw text can be anything. So how far are we g uh how f how far are you getting raw text out of it do you think? Okay, well that's good, because for the dictionary the order doesn't make a difference, does it? So yeah, so um I'll get that from you and I'll write the hash table which goes over that and creates a dictionary file. So for the dictionary, is it okay if I do, whatever, word blank frequency or something? Just p could everybody sort of start from that? I mean I guess we can Yeah, I I need frequency as well. Well I think we might have a lot in common what we calculate because I for my latent semantic analysis need like counts of words within a document, uh within a a segment actually, within a topic segment. Can I convert these probabilities back into frequencies? Okay. Oh, so that's what f Rainbow does, because that's what L_S_A_ builds on. Like it builds a f a document by frequency matrix. So I could probably get that. Even though but I already have I already have my code to build it up myself. No, don't bother. I have my code already. Um Yeah, so Dave, you said you need the frequency counts actually for per document, would you say, not for the whole thing? It more and more appears to me that if we if we scrap the notion of the meeting as an individual thing and sort of ju see meetings as as topic segments and have sort of like hierarchical topic segmentation instead, then it's b like a more coherent framework. Wait, are we are we using this um for the for the for the do for the weighting in the end now, this this measure you're calculating? Because if we're doing Like I think for for the information density we uh we should calculate it on the lowest level, not on the highest. But like 'cause Yeah, but w it don't you have to like go sort of like for in a document versus the whole thing? Isn't that how it works that you c look look at r I don't think that's a good idea because isn't it like that we expect th there to change over i b with the different topic segments more? That they talk about something different in each different topic segment. 'Cause that's what relative term frequency is about, that like in some context they're talking more about a certain word than in general. So that would more be the the topic segments then. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm just wondering if there's ways to abandon the whole concept of of meetings and sort of but just not really treating separate meetings as too much of a separate entity. But But on algorithmic level, whether we actually whether there's some way to just represent meetings as as topics. Hmm. That's not really what I meant. But I think I have to think more about what I meant. Um g I'm confused about everything. Yeah. I'm I'm not so concerned about the m a meeting plus something else, I'm more talking about like, yeah, the keeping keeping the same algorithm and the same way of handling it and just saying like just this this topic here i uh it happens to be like a whole meeting and it has sort of sub-topics, so just that sort of topics a hierarchical concept where like a topic where there can be super-topics and topics, and the super-topics are in the end what the meetings are, but in general at some level super-topics are treated like like topics. Hmm. Mm I'm not really sure what I want. So sorry, could describe that again, the Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So that would be the series as a whole. That would be sort of m meetings, yeah. Yeah. I'm a I'm a I'm a bit brain-damaged at the moment, but I think I'll just sit together with you again and and go through it again. Hmm. So so I'll is th it like is this and this structurally then always identical? So that we can that we can treat it with the same algorithm or Yeah, I'm also not sure how we can go from from bottom-up. I have always thought it's like more that oh, whatever, I'm a can't think of it at the moment. Probably this is all too complicated worrying about that at that moment anyway. Now have have we have we decided anything, are we doing anything? S Wednesday we are meeting and looking at their at their implementation in some more detail to actually understand what's going on. We had two things from their stuff just to make sure that we are like understand it, we understand it enough to to m modify it. Yep. How would we do that? By just making like it w read write for everyone. 'Kay, who has most free space on their Same here. Well we alternatively we can probably just make another directory on the beefy scratch space. I mean that's where I'm having gigabytes and gigabytes of stuff at the moment. No. No. Yeah. But I think if he sends to the I think if he sends to the port he'd probably be in a better position. Yeah. Hmm. I think he said yes to that. I think uh that was like in when we were still in the seminar room, I asked that once or like ask is it possible to get it off and nobody said like people were discussing about the technical practicalities, but nobody said anything about al being allowed to or not allowed to. I mean, we have access to it here and I guess it probably means that we we can't give it to anybody else. But but if they give us access to it here o sitting on a DICE machine, then there shouldn't be a reason why we shouldn't be able to use it on our laptop. I personally don't have too many friends who would be too keen on getting it anyway. I have that really excited pirate copied thing. It annotated meeting data. Huh. Wait, wait, wait. Um sorry. Yeah, sorry. What I just realised, we should really t keep different serieses completely separate for virtually all purposes. Just let's be careful about that, because like the the ICSI corpus isn't isn't one meeting series, it's several meeting series with different people meeting for completely different things. For each meeting. Alright. Okay, but like let's just be careful that whatever we sort of we merge together, that like the highest level of merging, it's not the whole ICSI corpus but individual series.. I think we might actually I think That's probably be somewhere like well or something like it. Um I think we might just get away with for the whole project just like looking at only one series and just doing within one series. I mean you can do everything you want in one series. Oh yeah, let's take that. Is the is the data always clearly split up by different series? Uh like is it easy to just pick one Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So at at every level everyone has to be careful to really just take even at the highest level, just take stuff from one series and not merge stuff from different series together because they would probably be just majorly messy. Yeah, so so t so like if even if we make one single text file which has the whole corpus, sort of our corpus, that would still be from one series only. Wou but it what you're producing at the moment is like individual text files that sort of have the raw text for a whole a meeting as a whole or Mm-hmm. Yeah. 'Kay. Um so is is anybody creating an uh a real raw text thing at the moment, like which is just the words? Yeah, tha 'cause that's what I'm gonna need as well. But i but if there uh b aren't like so it's it's start and end times just for the file. Like is it just the first and the last line? Or is it for every single thing in So what do you mean by just not print out that? Okay. If you're into it, can you make a text file which just like makes just the words? 'Kay. Do you want it straight flowing, 'cause I would need something that marks the end of uh of uh is is yours segmented by topics then that like is there any information that you have to the topic, to the automated topic topic segmentation? Oh then I need something different later anyway. Okay, but for now, if you c Okay. You're gonna put that as an output of yours, the segmentation. Okay, so for now can you create like sort of just uh a dump which is pure text, just pure text so that I can get a dictionary and you can work on that for your topic segmentation. And Or for for the series. But I can but I can also deal with separate files, I mean I can just write the algorithm that it loads all files in a directory or something. But I mean if you But if you can put it in one single mega-file, that would be quite useful for me. Even though for you, wouldn't it be easier if you had different files because then you sort of know like Yeah. So give m give me different files as long as like it m if you could name them in a way that is easy to enumerate over them, like whatever, one two three four five or something. Or just anything that I can Yeah. Is is it something that's easily enu like to enumerate over? Is it some just some ordered pattern? Okay, cool. Okay, cool. Yeah. In the right order. It's just a wish list. Orders. When do you think you'll have um like a primitive segmentation by some ready-made topic segmentation by some ready-made tool ready? Okay. Okay, cool. 'Cause I'll need that then when it's done. Okay. Mm-hmm. What's what's nine megabyte? The the That sounds quite reasonable. That's nine nine characters over okay. Okay. Okay. That is for are we are we picking one particular series at the moment? Or Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I guess we can probably process the data for all different series and then check which series is the best for the presentation. It sounds quite reasonable, nine megabyte. I mean if you think if it's r roughly a million words and nine characters per word sounds realisti Yeah. Yes, I'm gonna build a dictionary then from that. Like just a list of the words that maybe a list of the words with the frequencies or a list of the words sorted alphabetically or numerically. What what does anyone want? Does this there any wishes for dictionaries? So I'll create a dictionary. Add add the structure, yeah. And then the actual file we can probably like copy from your home directory or something like it. Yeah yeah, but I'm sa I'm saying for the whole thing in the end. Then like the big thing we probably shouldn't do by email. Yeah. Oh, from the time I get the file I can do that in an afternoon, the next sort of the next morning. Oh, you mean how long processing time it takes. Ah, it's a it's a bog standard algorithm. I've I've sort of I've written it for for DIL just in half an hour or something similar. It's just you put them in a hash table and and say well if it exists already in the hash table then you increase the count by one and I'll probably implement some filter for filtering out numbers or something. Really? How do you do that? Okay, well I don't know any Perl. I mean if anyone wants to do a Perl script for that that does it does it nicely, I uh I've no problem with that. I but I think I have the Java code virtually ready because for DIL I wrote something very similar. Like for DIL I wrote something that counts the the different occurrences of all the tags um Sorry? The hash table? Uh I've never serialized anything. Wouldn't that be absolutely massive though? And then seriali and then write the serialization to a file. So you want like a se like a file which is the serialization of a hash table. Okay. Yeah. I I'll I'll check if I understand how it works. I mean otherwise I can give you the code for loading a dictionary. Give you my my it's just it's it's sort of it's a line break separated file, you know. Yeah. Yeah, I'll see if I understand how to serialize. There's a there's a serialise command so that gives me one mega mother of a s Yeah, but do they automatically write to the file anyway I'll I'll figure that out. We don't have to Yes, is that pretty much pretty much it? So Dave and me look at how NITE X_M_L_ works and we're Hmm. I'll build a dictionary as soon as I get the text. And yeah, so that When do we have to meet again then with this? How are we gonna do a demonstrator next week? My God. No no, not demonstrate, but like didn't you say that uh didn't we sort of agree that it would be useful to have a demonstrator of it, like some primitive thing working next week. That's gotta be very prototype. Mm-hmm. Ah well, let's go. Sorry. I feel like like hanging mid-air and not really like finding a point where you can get your teeth into it and start working properly and so it's all so fuzzy the whole Yeah, but it at the moment but at the moment it's also an implementational level. Like with the data structures, I'm just like over these vague ideas of some trees, I'm f Yeah. It's just we are half-way through the project time table. That's just what freaks me out. Um",EN2001a
"Hmm? This isn't supposed to look like just Ah, sod that. Okay, there. Group K_. Da. Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Whatever. It's yeah, I never get this, so what's the point of if this is strapless if this strap's supposed to go behind m I obviously doing this wrong. Obviously failing this like whatev calling centre and tra Like this and then yeah, you know what the shit has to do now. Okay. Yes, so um actually I just realise I don't have power, let me just switch on the other which is gonna run out. Okay. So there's probably not much to talk about at the moment in terms of like talking about each other's stuff, I mean beyond what we've been talking about yesterday. So what I've been thinking is maybe if we try to really make sense together of the X_M_L_ format to be sure that we can all produce the data that we are producing in a way or at least I mean I guess my data I'll probably load in from completely different way anyway because it's matrix, but all this stuff that goes with annotation, that we have it in the right format. Maybe if we just sort of pool what we know about the X_M_L_ format and try to make sense of it. I don't at all know how to go about this. Um what I did just now is I downloaded Um I downloaded some files, some X_M_L_ files and I was thinking if we maybe just should go through some of them and like try to see if you understand the general structure and pool together what we think about the structure, what we think that things mean. And then talk about how the annotation for information density and stuff should maybe be structured in a similar way. Or but I don't r I don't really have an idea like what, other words, what we would do today in this meeting. I mean What's that part? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes, so does anyone have a good idea where to start like which what so what is it we talk about getting in at the moment? We're basically just 'cause the two of you will merge your data together, right? In some way like i in the end it'll result in one annotation. So the only thing we're trying to tie in is just an additional annotation which is similar to the annotation about what what would it be s most similar to. Simply to the segmentation information or Okay. I'm not sure it Ah. See, that's what I was thinking. Not sure what software I have at the moment, which would be hello? Um Yeah. Ah. Does anyone know any good standards software displays X_M_L_, I'm not sure. Yeah, but I'm afraid I only have Firefox and Firefox doesn't have the nice X_M_L_ viewer anymore. I think I don't have Mozilla.. No. I can probably just Emacs them. But But going from from a word business, wouldn't it be easier to then go back and calculate for each utterance? You know, wha wha each turn, so if we Yeah. So d Does anyone does anyone know in which file the actual, like what's it called, the splitting into the utterances? Is is called is that Is it What does it end with? Does it with with SAX? Does that look like it? Okay. Be nice. Let's actually just see if maybe K_ right. Oh this is how much time you spend just getting the right software going. Is that better to see? I guess yeah, white and black is better to see. So just see if I can view Okay. So This this But what is this? I mean this doesn't contain any content. Like any text. Oh wait, somebody s s somebody explain that slowly to me. So So what do all these things in this file have in common? What what are they? No but w like uh so they are they are segments in what sense? Wh what's definition of a segment then? Okay. And and that's usually dialogue what what's difference i between provenance dialogue act and between segmenter? I don't A dialogue act uh a dialogue act annotations of dialogue act. So is that just another representation of text? Just see, can we have this files somewhere. So the stuff that's that's called segment here that do we know which file this is pulling from? From yeah, it's it's c it from words X_M_L_, is that it's saying here? Let me see if I have that words X_M_L_ file. So let's for example look at Okay, let me just try to get them all to a different screen. Uh uh is that what we were Sorry, I'm just I'm trying to arrange them, so that we have one above the other, so to make some sense of that. So no. Here we had Um I'm just trying to understand what this segments file is about. Like it's it's referencing here it's referencing to To a certain position in the in the words file. So it's that non-vocal sound one here. That's the mic noise, okay. But what's the does it always just oh no, it's it's referencing to several word structures. So this would be basically be a a sequence, right? So that's from W_ fifty two. Are they not ordered or oh yeah, from W_ fifty two down to W_ what are we talking about? And yeah, w sorry. Okay. So this so this is somebody saying it it doesn't. Do we have any confirmation do we actually see from this file who's doing it, just out of interest? Oh. Sorry, in speaker D_'s file. So this is where he'd like time stops. And then it only starts at a later time, because oh, you don't see when I'm pointing at screen, it's just for this. So then it starts here this time against speaker D_ because in-between there's somebody else. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So the the file with annotations for information density, what would that be like? Would that be like the segments file, giving a start word and end word, or or would that How would that be to best tie in with the system? Sorry? Something like something like this or like where you give sort of a reference to a beginning and an end position. Well that would be in the same file, wouldn't it? It would just couldn't we have a like uh I guess we could introduce a different um We have for now if we just do something which for every segment in here attaches actually can we not tie it to the segments file? Would that not be the way how they would want it to have to do as if we in the end, if we want to attach to each of those segments one number for now. And those segments have uh do they have an I_D_? Yeah, I guess they do. So this is the I_D_ of a specific segment, right? Yeah, so wouldn't it I mean the problem is they've me haven't looked at the exact inner workings of their of their engineered. But you'd think that the easiest way and the way that how it's intended to be would be just, if we have here a link to the segment, a like an I_D_ for that segment, that we just create another file which links to the segment and then has an additional value which is the number. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, oh sorry, I I thought we were talking about having two files. I was think yeah, I I think that I I understood wrong. I thought you were wanting to have two different X_M_L_ files, with one the reference and one just th just the number. And I was thinking that's probably what you meant, just um having like for each sort of of our segments having just the I_D_, which is referencing to these segments here and another attribute which is the the value. So this whole information we would then store in this Ah, no, that I don't have access to because I didn't download like there's this one meta information file where it describes the structure of all the files and describes which um which attributes they bring in. So we would add that to that file? Saying that sort of we bring in information density. And then we would create the file of that type, which we probably couldn't call it segment. I'm not sure. We probably might have to have a different word for it. I'm not sure if it there's any trouble with it repeating. In the existing segments file. Yeah, I reckon actually if we make a copy of it What uh what are you saying about the w I th doesn't the lazy loading apply to everything? I mean that it sort of dynamically loads. You think it i it l it loads the whole of the segments file every time. Okay. The segment at the moment is split up over Hmm. No but I think it's too early to really like discuss that in detail, because we don't at all understand at the moment how the internal data structure like how the loading works. So maybe if we g if we go ahead, do you think it would be possible for you to do an like something like segments or maybe just a copy of segment which has an attribute for for each segment, um but it is like with a with a value with a density value. Would it be easier though, because all your methods are sort of not working with their whole time frame structure there. So would it be easy for you to to tie the things together. Like if you're doing it on on the word basis here with those words, that in the end you then tie it back in into the right segment here. I mean you probably have to do a bit of Hmm. You're doing it time-based at the moment. So this isn't directly having time references, but you can get the oh, it is actually here. Okay. So if you slice it up by time, you'd probably be able to just like attach like just some attribute of info val just f to each of those segments. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Um I don't understand enough of what their data structure is. This probably would be a lot easier would I really understand how they are handling the data internally, 'cause then we c then I could say oh, it's easy to just tie it in if you just have it time-stamped that just reference by words and stuff. But t at the moment So you would you're doing i you're doing a word by word base. Mm-hmm. Okay. But every word does does the word picking, like does it always have the same information value in your thing i does it depend on its position like It be d depends on the position. Hmm. And you're doing this via some software that's like external software, so you can't So what if you if you if you get the results from that software and you go back over it then with that file sort of, you write an algorithm which which then goes back because they they're in the right order still and stuff, right? So that shouldn't be a problem. Oh but this is by speaker here which makes it slightly more difficult. The problem is that actually NITE X_M_L_ probably provides a lot of the tools that we'd need to do that. In in a temporal sequence. But but would the information density algorithm still make any sense if you split them up, because I mean the whole I thought the whole thing is that you look at the frequency of a word in that specific how often a word inc occurs in a certain topic versus how often it occurs over the whole corpus and that from that it calculates. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I have a gut feeling it's not a good idea to split it. Yeah. No, but I mean it can't be that difficult. If you if you already have you have in the right order all the words with a with a score to them, and you have a file which has each word and a time stamp. So those two tied together have each word and its time and and and and its proba and its value. Yeah. So they're they're at the moment so It appears to me that Rainbow was made for something quite different. Hmm. I actually like um um i are you actually sure that Rainbow is doing a measure, like is returning a measure of what we are trying to measure, 'cause it it seems to me that it's just it sounds like something quite different in in d many aspects. Mm-hmm. And w Yeah. Yeah. But where do you have the original category information from? Yeah. Yeah. So where do you where do you have them from at the moment the split up? In i in the t in the topics, in the in the human topic s um so you've split them up by topic at the moment. Yeah, but Okay okay okay. 'Cause I was just thinking that doesn't make sense at all, but yeah, if you if that's just while you're waiting. Okay. Have you ever like looked into different ways of calculating, 'cause I was just thinking like I mean the for example the the infor um what's it called, the entropy calculation, is that she boxed it under the simple calculation that you could probably write the script in no time at all and Yeah, but I'm also just like I think that probably the entropy value at the moment for a word is closer to what we're at the moment looking for. I can just like k k I can sit together with you for twenty minutes and just show you the entropy code that I wrote for my other project and it probably and we should work together because it's we used t we have to we'd use the same matrix as I'm using in my latent semantic analysis, you'd use to calculate entropy scores. And then we'd have um a score which actually which would be the same for the word in each position. So in that sense it's doing something a bit different, and like w basically the score that I'm talking about is a conditional entropy score which just checks how much information, the fact that there's one word tells you about what would be the next word. But that's a relatively good measure of whether that's a very specific word, in which case they are usually words which tell you quite a lot or a very general word which usually doesn't tell you quite a lot. Um it it's basically the it's the standard entropy formula. And you sort of you you Yes, yes, it has. I mean, I think the official le sort of the official description of what it tells you is um how much that like the fact that a given word occurs tells you about what's the next word's gonna be. Which doesn't sound too exciting, but it it just works out in the way that words which are promiscuous and which occur with everything all over the place have very low a scores on that, and also usually end up being the words which are p Least like expressive, and l contain less information. Yeah, function words or just very general nouns. Pr probably like what whatev for example the word computer in that context. You could imagine it to f like be in all in all the contexts. Yeah, so we would we w wouldn't do it by word, we would sorry, okay, um I was I was getting that w actually, sorry, I was getting that wrong, I was getting it from what I did my project. Now in this case, we would do it by per mee words per meeting. So Hmm. Yes, it it's probably doing it's probably doing quite the same thing in the end, but I'm just saying like with that thing you would easily have an algorithm which at the moment provides you for each word with a score which we can use. Um no um, I was I was I was describing the wrong thing. In this case we wouldn't be doing how much it tells you about another word. In this case we would be doing given that you know a word, how good is it at predicting from which um specific topic that was. So that would yeah, in that sense it's the same thing here. Yeah, yeah, for a specific Yeah. The same word the word yesterday would be would have the same score all over the place. Okay. I c But but your category thing depends on that we not just have topic segments, but also that these topic segments we have them in categories. You you do wouldn't you need several documents for each category? Or several segments for each category. Do but will it word without that at all? 'Cause Yeah, I mean s so in our case basically every every s topic would be its own category. And the question is does the algorithm still make any sense in that I don't understand the algorithm enough for that. But what I'm really like because the entropical um calculation is so simple, maybe we should look into making that score just as a preliminary score that we have. Like it it's a very it gives you like I've looked at the result, it gives you basically something in the end which vaguely tells you just whether a word is a very specific word or a very general word. And I like there is some hope that probably having just sentences where there's lots of very specific words, if you mark them as being more interesting than the words which are only very general words, that they would get us somewhere. Probably one point zero is very high information value. Yeah, 'cause this would Yeah, in in a sense I mean this is a bit like the what like document frequency over total frequency. Measure it sort of just going by What do you mean every sequence of the same Mm-hmm. Within th within the topic, so like topic we had to when you say topic, you mean like just like from from a beginning to end point, like within one meeting there are several topics? But we don't have that information anywhere, do we? But but you you are segmenting. Well, I'm I'm doing one on segment similarity in the end, yeah. I'm doing like finding similar segments, basic latent semantic analysis. But But like f for now, like your segmentation is just splitting a meeting up into different blocks ver Not not from what Colin is doing from what I no. It's only like I'm writing an algorithm that which then tries to also again based on word p occurrence patterns try to link together maybe different ones of those. So So that yeah. Yeah, I'm also a bit b like I'm not a hundred percent sure about Rainbow being the right thing, 'cause it seems that Rainbow does in its structure quite rely on having different examples of the same category sort of in in a way. 'Kay. You know what, as a byproduct of my L_S_A_ I'll provide um a vocabulary like sort of a dictionary which for each word gives an entropy score entropy score, which just tells you of how much information the presence of a word tells you about which topic it is. Not which category, like I'm not I'm not lumping together separate topic segments into categories. But just like how much this word tells you about wh how likely that w the occurrence of that word makes it that it's a specific segment topic segment. Which is some measure already of how widespread this word is versus how specific f to a certain segment that is. And I'll just provide that, because that's just not much more work than just the usual thing. And then we can see how we can tie that in with the other stuff. So if you um keep on working on Rainbow meanwhile and try to find a way how to tie your Rainbow stuff into some way that we can attach it to a certain time segment. I'm just thinking, wh if It it used is each word completely unique, like sort of does it treat each word, each occurrence of word, as a completely unique event. Or does it, I mean, no, it it has to, I mean, basically the the form of the word is important, right? We can't just replace the word by an arbitrary string. Because it looks if the same word occurs again and stuff. Yeah, it it has to work with a m yeah, well I think it's a stupid question, like it it it has to work on on on the word, like on What I was thinking is whether if we replace the word by something uniquely id identifiable, then it wouldn't make a different which order it is. But that wouldn't work because it needs the word, because that's all it's working on. It's the word and that looks if that word occurs again and versus how often that word occurs in other context, right? So we can't attach some type of information to the word, just to the word string itself, like making an underscore, making the time or something, that wouldn't work. But would it have that in the untruncated version then, like would it s would the output be the untruncated version? It will probably um no, I don't think it would. Yeah, for now, I mean really just like Yeah, I think if we work together on an on an entropy based score. It's let me see if I can demonstrate T I mean, let's just keep on talking meanwhile and I'll try to start that up. It's it's it's really d it it's a very simple thing, but it it basically just does something which tells you how specific a word is. In a sense it's in a it's it's basically just to to a high degree really telling you how r how rare a word is or how common a word is. But uh as as the first step that's probably for for a prototype for next week that's probably not a bad thing, I mean even if it's just that. Even if you just like if you have segments where where lots of rare words occur, highlighted in darker red than segments where all the very common words occur. That's just that's somewhere to start from. And it's it's a bit more sophisticated than that, but then de facto it just ends up doing that mostly, from what I figured out. Um Actually I think I'm not gonna not gonna start that now, because that's probably gonna take too long. So if we get it on a word by word basis whatever you do it'll probably appear in a word by word basis, and what you have on a sort of segment but not quite segment base. 'Kay, what about the following model? I mean this is a very unscientific way of doing it in some sense, but what if we if we take time as the standard unit for now and sort of like make a massive one segment split super-array. Because everything you're doing can in one way or the other be ti tied down to actual time. So if we if we if for if for each one segment time slot we could attach a value, and then it would be easy to then go back when if we have the time marks here, and re-map that onto onto the length of a segment, you know what I mean? So if you have for each word say and we know that word starts at this segment and ends at that segment, and you have for like for some time period w the overlap and that period on the F_ ones and that period or something. So you also have a value which can be tied down to a time. And then we could just in m in Matlab or in something just create some massive super-array of of things for each for each like sort of time sampling slot and and calculate a value for this, and once we have this array, we can go with the script and sort of go for each segment to the starting and end times and say okay, this is from our time segment f here to this time segment there. So we take the some of those and divide them by by the number or something, create the average and put it in as the value for the segment. You know what I mean? Oh. Tha that's that's a fiddling play in the end, but that problem we'll always have. Because we don't have a useful way of automatically evaluating um We don't have a way of usefully evaluating automatically what's good and what's bad, so it's it's probably always gonna be a question of looking at it and saying okay, like running it with different different factor loadings and seeing okay, this way it works this well and this way it works that well. But it probably be more difficult for mapped t to map for you to map it on so for you sort of i Yeah, but so you say that inst like you basically say w having an array where each each cell is is one like is o is one word.. And then you would map your information onto individual words. Hmm? Would you be able to find out which word that is and 'Kay, and and then we could have like some type of just point in the end where the one scores from the all the individual word cells get multiplied all with like for each utterance or whatever. You have get all multiplied with the same value all the ones that are within that utterance. That's sort of the combination of of the two scores. And then we'd have to go back again and then put that back into that segment mode here. So that we because in the end we don't want it on a per word basis, but probably on a per segment base. Oh, yeah yeah, actually that yeah, that's true, so that it's easier if you are able to yeah well, I think that's probably back where we started at this. But you said it wi but you said it's more complicated, because your segments aren't those segments exactly. Hmm. And their segments do overlap. Uh the tho those do or those don't? Mm-hmm. Okay. So you could on their granularity you could on their granularity create a score like for each for each of their segments. Well I guess I mean for you, if you know for each word, if you find that out, then it has to be possible, because if we know sort of this is going from word to word or it this is going from time to time and then there has to be a way then for you say okay, this concerns these following words, and then just make make a simple mean over them. I think an interesting thing is if we don't combine your two scores in the in the X_M_L_ file you had, but if we do that in the software, then we can probably make ways of playing with it in the software and sort of l you know like adapting some sort of control, like playing around with look like it's playing with different weightings for that the utterance-based one versus the word-based one and sort of look at it dynamically. You know what I mean? Like playing around, sort of figuring out what's the best way of combining them by playing around and looking at the results. Yeah. Yeah, we could probably like make a uh um graphic display initially, at least for our experimenting. We'd just place them in different ways and then see how they interact with each other. Okay. Yeah. So do you think y like both of you then can map something onto their segments, like just each of you provide one value, like double value or whatever, like one decimal value or whatever onto onto exactly their segments. It's stated both in It's done both in terms of words and in terms of segments. It's a bit sad sort of that we do this before we've truly figured out how the NITE X_M_L_ thing works, because now we're doing it all by hand and like parsing and un-parsing that thing and it's it's all part of the framework. Uh How much easier would it be if we truly understood this. So 'Kay, I might just change my order of in which I do things and like forget my latent semantic analysis stuff until the weekend and try to really make sense of the of the NITE data system now, so that maybe as soon as I've understood that we find ways of doing that in within the NITE framework already, so that we don't manually have to parse times and entire things together. Well, at the moment what you would do like to to solve this problem is you would sort of like write some Perl script or something that gets this time value out of here and Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So provided that you get your words in the right order, do you think it is an easy task for you to it it's a f relatively feasible task for you to to get just a single value per segment? Okay. And you say you think you're able as well to map onto those segments. And if you're both able to map into those segments, then we should be able to get one file where we have like whatever two values, value A_ and value B_ both as attributes for for this. And that we could load into a prototype and see what types of disp what ways of displaying this information are there. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. There's probably also social interaction factors in that there's sometimes just a meeting like if people adapt their F_ zero to each other, then they're sometimes p Yeah. Can you not do something like just like not measuring the F_ zero or the amplitude at all, but just like the variance of F_ zero within a certain time frame and like sort of like just have some part for its very low variance with more the same F_ zero and one where there's a lot of more variance. I don't well actually I don't know about that at all. Yeah. Sorry. Mm. Hmm.. Okay. So at the moment you you just you measuring the F_ zeros relative to the average for the speaker or Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ri so the average Okay. Um so what you would be feeding in would be just like one value per speaker per meeting, so that oka that that's that's your average baseline, okay okay. No yeah, that that makes m yeah, that makes a lot more sense, yeah. So that would show you how much relative to how he sort of how he's performing generally in that meeting relative to that how he's in a specific segment. He or she. Yeah. Yeah. And for you that would be quite easy to translate into those segments. Yeah, guess I've asked this question fifteen times now. Sorry. Uh Hmm. Oh they w they do exist. The Castrati corps of the International Computer Science institute. Oh well. I'm afraid I have to go soon. But not quite sure, I mean is there anything more we have to talk about anyway? Yeah. See, as soon as as soon as I'm halfway through my L_S_A_ like basically as soon as I have the the matrix built, if of the document by word stuff, it's very easy to then calculate for each word a score, and I can just give you those scores and you can do with them whatever you want. Yeah, I think Colin, Dave and me will actually work on on the Java stuff, and it and we'll just see whatever you whatever you supply us, we'll try to tie in and visualise in some way or another. Um I'll ask Jonathan if we can postpone the meeting to one o'clock. So that would give us a chance of meeting in for an hour before that to discuss the questions that we had. Yeah, I haven't gotten like sort of my confirmation that w Wednesday is fine. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to expect a confirmation for my confirmation from him now or but I'll just email him again and s ask him if we can maybe make it one sorry, we said twelve and I'm asking if he can make one. This is a bit frustrating at the moment, this project, isn't it? It's so like difficult to to get to the point where you understand enough to really feel that. I don't know, I'm not feeling that I'm really working at the moment, I'm more just trying to make sense of everything. And it's a bit too far into the meeting for that, and into the project for that. Hmm. I guess as soon as we have a framework in the w in the type of the prototype where like sort of each of us can tie in their stuff and see what it l how how it looks like and how it performs, you know. That probably makes it a lot easier then, but it's sort of it's a boot-strapping problem, like for the prototype we need some type of data, but to develop the data it would be a lot easier to to have the prototype. Anyway, I gotta go. Hmm? Yes, but if it's if it's in a form which is easy to read in at the moment, that would be fine. Sort of like if basically if we have something like this segments file, but for each of you like just have one attribute. I think it's really easy if we don't merge them before-hand, but if we let them if we combine them in the prototype or don't at the moment, because then we can easily d display them individually, c contrast them to each other and play around with how y to combine them. Exactly, yeah. Yeah. And I mean computationally multiplying two integers or doubles or whatever shouldn't be the thing that slows us down. Yeah. Alright.
Yeah. You you have this going behind your ears, the yeah. Yeah. Hmm. No. Just maybe talk about um how you would give me your data file. Yeah. That's um the interface between having the topic segments and calculating the uh information importance of words. Yeah. So I I would need separate files for each segment or just maybe have delimiters inbetween each segment. Okay, yeah, and y then I can make files of that. Alright. No, I don't kno know it, no. Yeah, that's fine. I just I just need a a title for the file, but doesn't matter what it is. Mm. So uh we have then when we are mixing our um values together, is it um a value for each um expression, for each sentence or something? Yeah. Mm-mm. Yeah. Yeah, I would just end up with uh values for each word, so I wouldn't have um any boundaries for segments at all. I just I just would have the words, and then how we um how long each expression would be, I don't know. Yeah, but what is an utterance. Uh, yeah. Okay. So what we what we would fit in into the XML files, would it be uh um a value for each utterance? Or what you Okay. Mm-hmm. So then we would have to fit in more than just one where values um Yeah. But um Mm uh-huh. Yeah, it's better. So we n would need a value label for each of those segments that are not dialogue acts. For all those that point to the actual words. Yeah, that's there. No, above. Yeah. Yeah. So you mean an a an attribute. Yeah. Wouldn't it be easiest to just incorporate a new attribute in in this file? Yeah, I don't know, that's probably not very uh nice but would quite easy, wouldn't it? Yeah. But they display the segments in or that the utterances i in their um user interface as well, where the words are y um displayed. So so they have they have their utterances displayed in their interface. So that's they um access probably this file and then they display the words. So why shouldn't we be able to do that? Uh Yeah, the problem is probably that um I extract all the words and then uh I don't um use an I_D_ or something for it, so it would be difficult to write it back to the right position. It depends on the position, I think. Yeah. Yeah, I I could use another a different approach, though. It Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Um would you think it would make sense to just take um file files by speaker. It's it doesn't matter what input I give to um to Rainbow. So I just could g use the files as they are. I don't know if that's that would give an output. I don't know. No, it um I think it's not uh versus the whole corpus. It's um you have certain categories, and you measure which words um have the highest information for one category. So it's the categories across each other I think. Um probably yeah. But yeah, it's it's s strange. Yeah. Yeah, but what what the problem is, I don't know exactly. I think the information gain in Rainbow is ordered by the value of the information gain, not I am not sure if I can get the right order and the values. That's the problem. But I um if the order stays the same, it's no problem at all to i just write back again. But if uh it's ordered by information gain, I don't know where the words come from, because it's it has a bag of words representation. Uh yes. Is it is. It was made for text classification. Yeah, that's the problem. Yeah, um what it actually does is that you you put in some documents, and you have several documents per category. Um and you have several categories. And then it measures um which words are typical for a certain t category. And if you get a new document, it will um compare which words are in that new document. And if there are a lot of words that um are typical for one category, it will assign it to that category, and if it's typical for another one, it will assign it to that one. Yeah, it's because you have um y um you have um oth different files. If if this is your directory, you have um um a diagra um, a directory one, two and three. And this represents the category. Everything that's in there is in category one. A Yeah, just split it up somehow, yeah. Yeah. No, I've just um split them up uh somehow um by um there are several documents for um each meeting, and I just put one in each category. So uh it's it's not very sensible at the moment, because I'm waiting for the um topic segments or I'm just yeah. Yeah, yeah, probably. Yeah, maybe it's it's better if I write it myself, because otherwise it's too easy to just split things up into bins, and it it wouldn't be any work at all in terms of programming or something. Alright. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. How does it calculate that actually? Okay. Yeah, but that's the sa uh almost I think similar to what I'm doing, because words that are in every class, that are not very informative, but words that are only in one class are are very informative for that class. Oh okay. Alright. Yeah, that's th yeah. For a specific word per per All over the place. And in my case it would have I think it would have different uh values for each category. But in that category it would have the same value at each place. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Um that would be best, but I I would have to look if that. Um at least it works if there are several categories with each with one document each, but it um yeah. Yeah, that's the questio yeah, I don't know. Mm-hmm. Mm okay. Oh no, I li I th I thought something else that we d um we just split I need somewhere to split, and that um splitting at category boundaries um splitting at topic boundaries would a nice thing to do, rather than just splitting somewhere. So yeah, yeah. Yeah, but it I think it should work for just one document, because it it compares between the categories, and if you just have one document um it still can find out which words are informative for that category and which are not. So if you have just one document in each category, and there are a lot of um occurrences of the word the in each one, so this word will be not very informative across the categories. So it should work for one, but I'm not sure if how exactly it it um calculates everything. Uh I think it's not possible to look that up. Yeah, maybe it's possible to have a list that it's o that is ordered by Yeah, don't know. Mm-hmm. Um I don't know what you mean by that. It's uh Mm-hmm. Oh right. Mm. Alright. Yeah, you you can use um some kind of um truncation maybe if you attach a number to each word and say that it should omit the last part. Uh probably not. No, no. Yeah, maybe I should try something different and just programme it for myself. Because um Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, but how can we get to know what makes sense as a a function for joining everything together? Might be difficult to find that out. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You you could always find out how many words there are in an utterance, couldn't you? Yeah. So For example. Mm. So but Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah, then we sh yeah. We could even yeah, we could even have a look at our different measures, if they um come up with the same same kinds of yeah. Uh I think if I can provide something for the words, as they are It's stated from where to where the segments go. It should be uh should be possible. Yeah, so it must should be possible. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You mean by matching strings. Or what? Yeah, but what I've done is um a parser, an X_M_L_ parser where you can get the start times. So, yeah, that's quite easy, because it's it's an attribute and you just s say that you want the values of those attributes. I think that should be possible. I don't know how long it takes me. But Mm. Is laughter annotated at all? Because you could take that on ours out maybe. If you take the laughter out and then calculate it. Mm. Yeah. Not the moment. Maybe if we meet at the weekend. Oh I don't know. Yep. So uh no, how about the the prototype. If we want to show him something on Monday, we definite have to work together. Some of us at least have to work together to get it running probably. Alright.. Yeah, me too. ... Yeah, and also we don't have to recalculate if just one Okay.
Hmm It's with cameras. You look quite funny at the moment, Tim. Nice. Mm yes. Yes, perhaps yeah, but I mean they're all very very similar, all those X_M_L_ files. I had um a look at the um for example A_S_ Mm. Take Mozilla. Yeah, I think that would be m I mean uh for me it's quite difficult to say o on, you know, w um what scope one annotation would have. I think it would be certainly more than one word and I think it would work best with utterances or segments. Yep. I think just the segments as they're segmented in the for example in the point se point six five. I think so. And you would s probably still need um your values for the words, um perhaps for for um the keywords that are displayed when you click on something. Yeah, but that's another representation then, I think, f for the importance measure. Should yeah. Um po Yes. No, it's not. It's um for example, there's uh B_D_B_O_O_ one C_ point six. Uh I can't see anything very much, but yeah, that's that's it. Can you use a bigger font? Okay, so here there's for um each segment um uh that's really all segments, I mean it's it can be words or topics or um anything I think. Um that's why th it's for example, time provenance dialogue act or time provenance segment or time provenance No, but it yeah. Yeah, it p Oh, well some of them point to the words, other others point to the um dialogue acts. So that's kind of the global thing that ties together other things. Um yeah, they have their NITE I_D_, the time The segment is what is displayed in one line um by NITE. Yeah, it looks uh uh the segment thing looks in the into the words X_M_L_ file and the dialogue acts um thing. Yeah, I think it's in a different Um No, their their annotation of dialogue acts, and one um segment can have or one um of those word strings that are presented in one line can have several um dialogue acts annotated on it. That's why Yeah, it's from words. Yes. That's just below. But I think these segments are perhaps not exactly what we are looking at, because that's just o one tying all the others together. And the information or r I mean we are going to create a file that looks more like um the words file. I think. Yes. Yeah, they are. Um to discourse marker, DIS F_ marker fi point five. Yeah, that's there no no, up up. Go up. Yeah, right. Yeah, this is all the speaker D_. You and the speaker D_. Yes. Um you can see whether there's somebody else or not. You can see that in the w um W_ point um first it's W_ point um five uh fifty four and then it's seventy six, so there are um this number of utterances of other speakers in-between. Yeah, I think we would also need two of those. Yeah, I think we would have to have the same structure, one that points to it, where we tie together, all our information. So we would perhaps have to make one that's similar. Yes, and uh then another one that would perhaps give the actual probability value. Yeah, it could could probably be in the same file, I don't know. But if you have several layers, then you can't represent them on the same file. Yeah, in segment point one. Um there line below. Yeah, that's what I meant actually, yeah. Mm-hmm. Um But I I mean there's not all the information that is in in the c corpus in there in the segments file. I think that is just the um things that are loaded every time, but we have lazy loading, so it can load more than that. Perhaps we could just try to cope. Um, you know, to make our file one of those lazy loaded. But I mean I've no real idea how that works. Yeah, but yes, but it has um, you know, a basic thing that it loads, I think. So for example every time it loads the segment things, it can't it can't not display words, I think. And it eras I think so. That's how I understood it. Because otherwise in the in the other things there is no information about what the participant name is and so on. So in the segments file it's really the very basic that have to be displayed for any thing.? Yeah, I thin I mean it wouldn't be difficult to um create a file of the p sh of that shape. I mean that would be no problem. Um yeah, I I don't know how about you with your words, but um for my segments were the um F_ zero measurements and all those values I get from there. Um I always store the beg uh start and end time of everything I calculated there, so I would just have to pu put it uh yes. Yeah, it is. Uh actu but actually my segments are not always the same as their segments, because and their segments, there are um Pause um pauses sometimes. A Um yes, but uh yeah, I mean one segment of theirs is sometimes two segments of mine, that's just what I meant. Yeah, but for example I made a file that contains just the um start times. It could contain end times and words for all speakers of all meetings. I mean that's just the same thing as I gave, yeah, as I gave to you. But um uh displaying also a start and end times of every word. So you could perhaps use it to match um it with your additional information you got, couldn't you? Perl, a Perl script, yeah. No, no. Mm yeah. But would you then not get the typical words for every speaker? If you Because it would then say how it find that it's that speaker. Yeah. It's probability, yeah. Or or value, yeah. So, could you put the more information back in then? Yeah, but the topic isn't it? That's a topic information. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So how sure or unsure you are about the what's following our b our context measures, yeah. Yeah. But do we have enough informa enough data for that it gives us sensible things? Because I mean the the words we're look really looking for appear not too often, and if they appear five times in the meeting and they have each time a different, you know, differ some different surrounded words, perhaps we have not enough data. I don't understand what you Yeah, okay. Mm-hmm. But that would give the same value for one word every time I mean for for a specific word. Yeah, because then it would be quite easy to re-integrate it into such a Okay, but then it would also be possible to re-integrate it. It would be more dif I mean it would be a bit more work, but then Yes. Um and what well, what score would a word get that just occurs once in all the corpus for example? Even though there are all the other same topics where it doesn't occur? Mm-hmm. So would it be higher-scored than a word that um occurs in every um sequence of the same topic? Yeah, I mean um we have uh s uh our several topics. For example we have twenty topics, and um for one of these topics there are five occurrences, and we have one word that Yes, but across meetings um there will be the same topic several times. Ah. It wasn okay. I thought that was what you were doing. Yeah, but Yeah, but you make also um segment similarity, I think that was I I thought that would And they they are not related then to other blocks of Okay. I um Oh, okay. I misunderstood that then. So yeah, how would it work? I mean what would um the his information then be useful for in r Rainbow? Um I thought the point about that was that we would put um into s um serial categories all the segments of the same topic across meetings. Okay. Yeah, but but then it does okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Yep. Yeah. Mm yeah. Yes. Yeah, I mean I haven't really decided on uh how to really get the information out of this now, because um when I have for example um increased speaker overlap, that applies to several turns of course. But I could give um the information about, yeah, how how important this is to each of those segments. Yeah, pros um but you proposed um we we should break that down to have um the smallest um smallest um unity um of time duration should be one word. I mean, that would be because that would be what naturally came out of her thing. And Yeah sure, but I could then if I if I have um the value for a segment, I would perhaps just give all the important wor or mm yeah no. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I would say that someone have to break it down, aye? I would probably somehow have to break it down to to that level, yeah. Yes, sure. Yeah, probably somehow it should work that way. Yeah, but then okay, but th at that moment it would be better for me to just make it on a per-segment basis right way, and let her adapt it also to the segment basis. Yeah. Yeah, I mean mine are only more, but they have the same start and end point. Sometimes they're two segments and one with a gap in-between, but um the have um th th they don't overlap. No no, they don't, but um Um they're I mean my segments overlap in the same way as theirs do. But sometimes I have um split one of the segments into two segments, but it's easy to match the start and end times to map it to their segments. I uh hope so, yeah. Mm-hmm, yeah. That would be quite difficult, but yeah. Yeah, I mean that's what I'm already doing with my s uh separate Yeah, it's tells you even which words it is. Yep. Should be possible. Yep. Yeah, I hope to have some value quite soon, but um I just worked um I mean I just calculated the values values for um the average F_ zeros and um they're what's c I mean I didn't have a look at the data yet, but um they vary quite widely even for the same speaker across meetings. So one speaker had um an average of about a hun one hundred um in one meeting and one hundred sixty in another meeting, that's really that's strange. I mean perhaps it's because of laughter or something, that's what I was thinking, but I didn't have I'll probably look at it. Yeah, that's what I read in one of those papers uh as well but Yeah, but it could mess up things quite considerably. Yeah. But uh ar yeah. But all this is quite, you know, data-intensive. I when I um let the um just calculate the average F_ zero levels, it I think it needed more than half an hour, considerably more than what have half an hour f to delay it for our meetings, because um yeah, m I mean we have seventy five hours per, yeah, av average of six speakers, and they're measured every O_ point O_ one six seconds. And that gives us quite a lot of values. Yeah, what I did at the moment is um I um, yeah, I got the F_ zero values from for each speaker for his headphone, and I only take those um the w uh that were recorded at the time where he was actually speaking. And for those I calculated um the average. Zero. So that gave me um now one value per speaker per meeting. No no, that's just the average. No, that i yeah. Yes, I mean I r just uh needed to have this value now to relate um m how yeah. Yeah, I think. Yeah. Um amusement and so on is yeah. Yeah. I I I mean it I actually have to look at the data what causes these um Because it's quite funny to have a m male speaking at two hun two hundred um. Yeah, sure but Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I am at the moment fiddling around with my data and not quite seeing how I get to a sensible abstraction level, you know. From my very Yeah. Yeah. So I mean you will be happy with some data, even if it doesn't make much sense. Try uh try yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, if it's already on segments base, that's not too much.
Look's good. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's true I think. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we haven't got that much to talk about, I don't think. Yeah. Yes, we can do that. Alright. Yeah well, that that's the way it works. It's got delimiters in-between the mar the boundaries. But Yeah, if you're happy to do that, yeah. And you're saying you need a a label for each segment. But I mean the most I ca you don't need a one. Well, I could give you an I_D_, but it'd be quite difficult to actually give a topic a title. Right. Okay. Yeah, that's no problem. Hmm. Mm. Um is it not segments? Or is it dialogue act dialogue acts? Yeah. I think that's it, yeah. Yeah, they've all got an I_D_ for each utterance. Yeah, and it's got a different uh file for each speaker. N no, it just points to the to the words. Yeah, yeah. The I suppose so, the utterances. But also includes things like like Yeah, think so. Mm. Yeah, can you not just leaves those lines blank? Oh alright. Okay. Hmm. Yeah, what did you use to make that file? Just in Perl? You didn't use an X_M_L_ parser? Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Well like function words and stuff. Mm. Hmm. Well, um when it splits the topics up, it does do it on regular words that um that occur. But it doesn't tell you what they are, no. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can't really get any other output. No. No. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's supposed to split it into cu coherent topics with the similar information. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Oh I'm sure it'd be quite straightforward, some of the tasks we have to do. But yet no one really understands them, the actual X_M_L_ parsing. Hmm. Yeah, that sounds like an idea. Yeah. Yeah, just send us an email and tell us what's happening. Right.",EN2001b
"Wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings. Yeah. Not a lot. No. Hmm. Okay. Sounds like you've done some stuff. So 'Kay. Hmm. Hmm. Everything. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. To just have the sort of main same sort of idiom throughout kinda. So Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. But then it's not as extensible. Like if we wanna add more things in the future, then we have to well, new buttons. I don't know. Whereas a menu type thing is more flexible that way. But We're probably not gonna be adding too many things. Okay, exactly. I know, I know. True, true. Yes. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Actually, Yeah, but maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well. I mean speaker characterisation tied into I don't know. Di Just some way to sort of leverage that information. Like we have it, we're doing it, but what how does it help the browsing? Or what can it give us in the browsing? Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Right. Yeah. True, yeah. Is that just from the main main window? Is that is that from any particular window, like if we wanna sorta get like if we were on the users versus like topic or something, have a right-click from for these various things to yeah. Right, yeah. Yep. Okay, yeah. Now it's consistent throughout. So, yeah. Right. Actually yeah, like um another common thing, like if we have it so it's set up that um if you double-click and it goes to a default thing on the menu, I mean that's kind of a typical kinda action that would happen. If you double-click on a particular topic or something, then it goes to sort of a like a default view, so it'll be like all the um cases of that topic, either whatever we decide the default to be, whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting, and just show up the the particular instances of that topic in a meeting. Like I'm just thinking to have the default there, so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do and we know that that's the most common thing that's gonna happen, so the double-click will do that and so save them the trouble of right-clicking and choosing the item on the menu. Well, it might come to us as we start playing with it. Um like we have the the right-click menu. You'll have the menu, right-click it, but instead of like have a default double-click, so if there's a de so it'll be a choice from the menu but yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, exactly. Well then they close it. Yeah. You know, it's not it's not the end of the world. Yeah,. Yeah. Okay.. Hmm. Mm. Well, yeah. Mm-hmm. I think we probably need that, though to have the f the full flexibility, we need to have that there, but um yeah. Mm-hmm. Although the thing is typically though, is someone gonna have five windows open at the same time, probably not. Probably just two or two or three of whatever whatever they're looking at, like dialogue acts, to whatever, characterisations. Hmm. Yeah, true. Hmm. So like have a tab there? For something like that choose on choose one. Yeah. Oh you should be able to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, or even just have buttons on it, toggle buttons or something on the tool-bar for that window. Just something. A lot of different ways we can do it, it doesn't doesn't have to be a tab or whatever. Just gonna be yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Or check-marks. Even have two of 'em checked and send Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. True. Oh yeah? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, like a lot of these can be, like once we get the disfluencies out, then we can you know, have transcript without the disfluency, transcript with the disfluent disfluency. Have all these, you know, have all these sort of using the same window and so we can put a lot of and probably mutually um whate distinct, yeah. Exclusive, yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Right. Yeah, that kinda makes sense. By the end of February. Okay, right. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, so we can plug it in and Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Actually is the code accessible, like the the GUI stuff that you've done, yeah. Like can we just like copy like the latest stuff out of your directory, somewhere? Or Like if we're gonna just try and like take a look or something, try and just plug some stuff I think you can if Well, if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable, then we c know the directory to get in then and just That might be might be an idea. Yeah. I think by default they are I think really? Or Yeah. Okay. Okay, alright. Okay. Or you could just email to us. Okay, yeah, yeah, okay, right. Yeah, right, okay. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Lower case. Yeah. Hmm. Right. Um all the searching stuff. Like the the in inverted file stuff and um the next search query and all that. Hmm. Yeah. So you could probably just use that code, like that was behind the question she asked him earlier. Just You know, the re-using code and stuff was just like okay, good. Um apparently Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, probably. We'll probably still have to do some other file manage while, I don't know, creation. Messing around still, though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Hmm. Yeah. Huh? Okay. Right. Okay. Right. Yeah, it's good idea. Yeah. Mm-hmm, libraries. Hmm. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly, exactly. So you're still working? I see. Yes, exactly, same. Yeah, I mean betwe um I sup yeah. Yeah. Right. Well well you're in S_P_N_L_P_ and S_P_ two, right? So yeah. Yeah, that's where I'm at. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, that's fun. Oh yeah. Okay. So. Yeah, I was thinking that we can probably get uh start attacking this seriously and then just um, yeah, hopefully have something by next week that we can sorta try integrating into the GUI. Okay. Think that should be possible. Okay. Why? Hmm. Well they did say it wasn't the most efficient. Very clearly, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hmm, right, right. Yeah. M yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, seriously, on the weekend. Yeah. Well f Uh Um Yeah. Yeah. How many hours is this? Hmm. Yeah, seriously. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I gotta work on. Mm. Who was doing that? Oh really? Damn. Yeah, yeah. These can be changed as well. Okay, yeah. Um I don't know, it doesn't matter. If if you want to. I mean it's just, you know, play around with some extra stuff. You have some time, why not. Hmm. Was that in informatics course? Or Oh. Oh, it like digital, okay. Okay. Yeah. Hmm. Alright. Yeah. Fine. Hmm. Yeah. I'll be happy when this week is over. Yeah. Well I don't know, is that about it then or anything else we need to discuss? Did we wanna meet before we talk to Steve next week. Well, I dunno. We'll probably get some work done over the weekend, so I dunno if after D_N_L_G_ or something, maybe just have a little quick little update and just Yeah. Well we can decide. Yeah, exactly. True. Yeah. Search. And well sure, why not. Couldn't be that hard. Well, it'll be, you know, still limited version of, you know, the next query search. But, no no. Won't be the whole thing then. Um like we can just decide sort of things that we do wanna do. Hmm. yeah. Well, actually most are just dialogue acts. And what else was there.. summary topic Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it'll get behind schedule, yeah, pretty quick. Like you're saying, yeah. Well actually, do we wanna set a date for interim prototype? Specifically a date? Yeah. Okay. Is it semblance of reality. Yeah. I see. Right, true. Mm decide on that on over the weekend. Yeah. Right. Yeah, totally. Oh, just like the basic. So like no. Sorry? Yeah. Just like all the and seeing the code, and just sort of how just see the basics of what you've done. Like just get a a quick look over and just the basics. Yeah. Or like like, you know, the class paths all that sort of thing. Like just just say okay, well here's you know, everything's basic in set-up and then just yeah, just jump right in. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. In the morning. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Well thing is, you know, if yeah, something like that could happen anytime 'cause uh yeah, like my schedule's like a class, break, class, break, class, you know, that sort of thing. So so yeah, I know, exactly, exactly, that's what I'm thinking. So something like that and then if I have a class I can run off and do whatever. Yeah. Okay. Actually Monday, Monday might be good d um. Yeah, yeah. Anytime um, not at n not at noon or two or four. No, in between those is you know, like one or three or Sure. Possibly. Yeah. Yeah, that's an option too. Yeah, after. Sure. That's fine. Yeah. Or three thirty. No, just yeah. That'd be necessarily necessarily short. Actually we can't get in there though. W we well we can get in through the through the the card the card door. Yeah. How about if we take uh a tour? Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay. Just sort bang on it. Actually I was asking Steve about that, whether we can get in there. Whether he was gonna get us access into the the computer room. Yeah, print Okay. Right. Is there a printer in there too? A nice okay. That would come in handy, yeah. Hey, we could we could photo-copy our um assignment if we wanted to. Yeah. Well the comments I'm thinking. Um Yeah, that's true. So after D_N_L_G_. Yeah. As long as D_N_L_G_ doesn't go late. Oh. So Sounds like me. Are you? Next week? Or the week? How? Oh. Yeah. That's cancelled? Oh really? Hmm. Um something like that. I think one or couple classes were cancelled. Yeah. Exact Yeah. I th Yeah. I think it was up to the professor whether they did it or not. Well, I don't feel like teaching. Yeah, okay. I think yeah. I think D_I_L_ will probably have one to make up for missing classes. D_I_L_ will probably have classes, yeah. Yep. You can have it. Yeah. Huh? Which one, the top one? Um Do you really want multiple windows from a single lap? But most will probably want to go with defaults. Yeah. Yeah. You'd be s Yeah, exactly, and just the other comment about whether you wanna do both speaker characterisation and topic segmentation. Yeah, yeah that's about it. Nothing terribly exciting. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Okay. So Okay. Yeah. Okay.
Yeah, exactly, yeah yeah yeah. Should we Well should we just go around and everyone says what they d what they've been doing, how far they've got. Well I hope so. Okay. Well I've got a browser now, which Whoops. Already gone. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. So yeah. We've go a browser we've um which comes up automatically with a transcription box and the topics. And then when you go on the menu, you can select a summarisation box, which pops up, and an audio player. Um and a s I think the search works as well, so you could pop up a search. And it loads up um just the background window is empty and um so when you start, you have to either open open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that. Does that make sense? Um the transcription box has got a summarise but button, which doesn't do anything yet. Um now I wonder wh how we wanna do, you know, we want a pop-up window with the speaker characterisation. Um either we could do that you know, when does the pop-up come? Either we can when you click on the the I_D_, any sort of I_D_ in the transcription box, or we can put an extra button extra few buttons next to the summarise button so that you actually in the transcription box, but so like you click on a button and then that opens whatever that speaker characterisation is. The problem is the r the left-click is already used because it highlights that um that part of speech or whatever that what he's been saying, you know, the the left-click highlights it. So that you can I don't know what happens when you double-click actually, but that'd be a bit annoying if you have left-click for one thing and double-click for something else. Um I think so yeah, when you left-click it, you can for example set set the marker there so that the mm the audio goes from there, I think. Um so we can't put it on left-click. We could put it on a right-click. We could for example have a little menu that pops up. So right-click on at menu, you know, and you can click on speaker characterisation, up pops the window. That's a good point. I don't know. Nothing else. Yeah, yeah, but um I don't know about you, but uh usually in Windows right-click doesn't do anything, does it? It opens a menu. Yeah, so yeah. So but that'd be yeah. If you just yeah. Yeah. Um or just, you know, or just the button. Well no no, you still have the menu the menu pop up that Well oh, yeah. It's more obvious, isn't it, w what you can do. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's true, yeah, it's more intuitive really, isn't it? Maybe, maybe. In the beta version. Um but actually what we could do is on in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the all the meetings that that user has been in. Like a search for that user. Is that gonna be useful or too much? Or Yeah, so y when you right-click on it, one one option will be give me all your meetings, characterise the speaker Or is that too much I mean? Yeah. Yeah, that's true, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. It'd nice to have it inconnec interconnected like Or you mean the the speaker characterisation? Oh well, yeah, I mean, I don't know about that. I mean it's the speaker characterisation is a bit like you said. I mean it's like a nice thing. We don't we're not actually sure what the user wants with it, but it's interesting, so why not give it to him. I I think we should do it. I mean Yeah, I mean that's that's still another level further. I mean we're not even there yet. You know, it doesn't even doesn't even pop up the speaker characterisation yet. Y we have to first define what what happens when you click on a user. Yeah. Yes. So should we try try to do a right-click when you then Sorry? Yeah. Yes. Wait. Yeah, there's a second thing about the topics, the topic window. We wanna somehow click be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that. Yeah? So we could do that in a similar way, do it right-click as well. And to have a different menu for our Yeah. So yeah. So we have basically two options of of browsing the meetings is by either um searching and opening individual observations. And when then we have the interlinking by right-click basically. Double-click Oh. Hmm. Yeah. I don't see there's anything obvious that was that would be able, you know, that would be Yeah, but then then there's the problem with a lot of windows popping up again. And they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is, you know what I mean? Yeah, maybe. Mm. Hmm. Especially if you have a touch-pad. It just goes oh. Well I'll I'll check what it does on on um double-click at the moment. 'Cause I think it might do something. But but yeah, mm but I don't I don't I d really don't see anything obvious that that would I mean if you can think of something that Sorry. Sorry. Um yeah, another thing. Single audio files. Do we wanna use them or not? Yeah, single channel that's single channel files. Do we want them? I mean Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah. I mean we might use them while wo to work with them, but do we wanna integrate them in so that when you browse you can here's Do you though? I mean it's not gonna make much sense if you don't listen to it on its own d do you? Does it? No, hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah, wh what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that he's mentioned? Do you think do you think it's really that bad? That's what I feel as well. I mean I'm I'm very much I w I wanna have everything customisable. Um Probably not, no. Yeah. Two or three maybe, but yeah. But yeah, it depends, I mean I I really wanna put the summary in somewhere, you know. And the summary for example is typical. You open the window, you read through it, you might click on you know, close it again straight-away. But it'd be good to have it there. I was just thinking of tab. That true. Yea yeah yeah yeah. That's right. I'm not sure yeah. No. I don't know. Do you reckon? I'm sure. I'm sure you could do anything. Hmm. I can have a look. But yeah, that that might be an idea, yeah. Hmm. But I mean people get used to it, I mean when you use a Windows or Linux for that matter, you have a lot of windows open. And you manage them. Yeah, you can minimise 'em. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's true, they're they're definitely Yeah, they're definitely gonna be in the same window, yeah. Exclusive. Yeah, that that was the plan for the disfluencies anyway. So d Yeah, do you wanna do that with summaries in? Put the summaries in in the same window. Mutually exclusive with Summary. Yeah, you wanna do that? Yeah. And finally the prototype he spoke about. What kind of prototype could we produce? Because I'm I'm just, you know, I go into the lab and I say right, what am I gonna change today. You know? And it kind of just it just develops, I'm not aiming for anything. Do we wanna aim for something? I'm I'm pretty much getting there anyway, to be honest. It's not it's not gonna be a lot more work. Oh. Hmm. Mm true. Oh right, I see. Hmm. Um probably not. I don't know, can you access other people's Yeah, sure. I don't know if it's readable at the moment, but you can sure have a d have a look. Alright. 'Kay. Right, well I'll make that readable then. Um so the directory is my number Well, this is not difficult. It's in all the emails. Not O_ four. O_ four, five five five, six O_. O_ four five five five six O_. And then um there's a folder um N_L_S_S_D_, and it's called the M_ browser. Yes, M_ for meeting. Really. No, I'm I'm extremely organised, you see. I've got folders for everything. I love folders. Yep, so that's me done. Someone else wanna talk about their stuff? Mm-hmm. W what where you doing again? The search, okay. Okay. Indexing. Oh. Oh right. Oh that's pretty much there, is it? Of making Oh great. Yeah, that's handy. So you think it shouldn't be too difficult? Oh, I see. Yeah. You have to convert it to some sort of format, I suppose. I mean you should look at look have a look at the the browser code then, because um, you know, they already extract for example transcripts. Put it into a window at least. What do you mean? This week's only two days old. Oh. Yeah. Oh that's complete rubbish anyway. Never mind. Just so stupid. Mm-hmm. Well ye the browser as I use it now or as uh, you know, it was there when I took it um uses the um the N_X_T_ search to get the data out of the out the files, which I think is odd, but I'm not quite sure how it works yet. I don't quite understand it. To get the data i for example to get the summarisation data, you have to search for I think the I_D_s or something. Yeah. Yeah. So they don't, you know, they don't say look in that and that folder, but they say search everything. Oh it does load up quite quickly. So you know, it's not too bad. But you know, you could have a look at them. No, this is not the actual search. This is just when you open what you know, to load the transcript for example, to find the transcript for a certain meeting, it does does an N_X_T_ search for the string, I don't know, transcript or text or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, so I don't know if you've looked at the search query s language, but it's like a dollar A_ text say. Yeah. And then yeah. Because every every of all of these um these files have got um tha an I_D_. And all the transcript files have got the string, I don't know what it is, words or text or something in it, so it just searches for those files. Vaguely. So Open. Um um well, it's in the code. Just that it, you know, it yeah, you define a search object, and then you search on that string. I had to figure out how to how to do the same thing for the summary. That's how I I had to I had to understand how to do the transcript how they did the transcript to do the summary myself. Yeah, just search for a specific string. So you could just, you know, you could use that when you if you wanna um take the data out and put it somewhere. Yeah. If you have a a question about w what the p the code means or where to find the code that you wanna, you know, whatever you wanna do, then just send me an email. I can explain it. Oh yeah. Actually, in the moment it's got a load of rubbish because the the um the browser that I used from this from you know, that they gave us, had a lot of extra stuff in, and I haven't dared throwing out to through out all the functions I haven't you know, that I don't need. Yeah, just in case. Exactly. Yes. So they're all in there ye still. A lot of rubbish, but they will be get will be chucked out right at the end, I think. Yes. Exactly, yes. Yeah. Precisely. The weekend? The weekend's still four days off. Oh. I don't actually have that much to do at the moment. Well Oh dear. Well I can't remember what I'm supposed to do, by the way. Am I supposed to do the summarisation thingibob? No. You do. Well, I'll do that then. Shall I do that then? I mean Or you know It shouldn't be to difficult. I mean Well I'm doing communications, which we had one exercise and I've done that like two weeks ago. And that's in in two weeks. Yeah, it's a nine nine course as well or ten or something. Yeah. And then then I'm doing parallel programming languages and systems, which we had one exercise as well, and that's in like Friday. Well I'm not doing any background reading, so you know. Being lazy. Oh. Yeah, if you like. We can always decide then, I mean yeah. Yeah. Um so what what are you planning to do over the weekend then? You're gonna do the search. You're gonna implement the search. Everything? Mm-hmm. It's just that I think we need to set ourselves some milestones, because otherwise You know Weeks will go by and Well you decide, I'm not doing much for that prototype. So Of Oh. Well, how about we get it done by then? I mean Then we can write about it in the in the interim report, and s you know, and then we've got something to show. Um oh and the the search interface. Maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you wanna be able to search for. And then if you want, you can give that to me and I'll I'll build a u nice, you know, a few tick-boxes and drop-down menus. No. Oh that's that's that doesn't exist. Tha that's completely cut and pasted. That does not exist. Nicely done though, isn't it? It's actually all these all these um things are are nicked from um you know, all these drop-down menus and tick-boxes are nicked from Google online. A screen-shot of Google. It's just so much fun. It's gonna be a little difficult more difficult. Yeah, I mean I was going to, but you know, the whole drop-down menus and stuff, what we wanna search for is not quite agreed on. We never agreed on what we wanna be able to search for. So Yeah, do you wanna, you know, just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do, and then then we could discuss it next meeting which options we really wanna include? That would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do. Know Know already what? Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can do that. Show you what bits the code Yeah. Ah, yeah. Well this time I'm dictating the time, 'cause I if I'm not there you can't do anything. Yeah, ah it's not gonna take an hour to explain it, you know. I mean Pick a time. I I you know, let me know, whenever. What Monday. What did you say? Three o'clock. Actually th yeah. Unless you wanna do it after the um after D_ D_ and A_. That's gonna be tight. Yeah, it what front door? I've not found that yet. Really? Really? Ah. Well, I'm just I've got it in my computer. Whatever is in my computer. I just think it's better to do it afterwards. Then we have all the time we need. Rather than have half an hour and then we'll surely run out. Oh. Actually it's not even confirmed yet. What was She doesn't even know what she's talking about yet, I think. Maybe it doesn't happen at all. Is it really? Really? I don't think we have a reading week though. The the Yeah, I don't think there is an official I don't think there was an official one last semester. I think it was just a bank holiday, wasn't it? No, Okay. Let's meet Monday. Hmm? Right. I think we need to tick the okay box, right? Ooh. Exciting. Should we turn these off then or what?
Okay. So what do we need to talk about? Yeah. Uh Yeah. Good start. Oh, I don't mind as well. This wasn't a good start. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Can you use double-click or Yeah, I don't know. Yeah. And then I guess a button button makes a bit more sense, 'cause otherwise you don't really know that, oh, what if I right-click now, what happens then? It's like more if it's visual. Yeah. Do you see my Yeah. But well, we we can have both, but whatever. Yeah, um I don't I mean it w it's more like part of the browsing sort of thingy. More than the speaker characterisation, as m Steve mentioned. Um, I don't really know how to involve the speaker characterisation into the browsing. Yeah, well Yeah. I mean I guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like, well if you get the speaker characterisation that someone s talks a lot in uh a certain topic, and then if you, I don't know, click on that topic, you get everything that's in that topic or whatever. And in that way but I don't know. No no no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh just let th Yep. Yeah. Like, I don't know, show the speaker characterisation for instance. Or just I don't know. But if you do double-click on something, don't you expect something to happen then? Sort of well, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, uh that was good start. I don't know. I guess it depends on the Yeah, what you're clicking on. Obviously. Single channel. No. No. Yeah. But uh well, couldn't we I mean you probably I don't know if you wanna have like the the full transcription and the summary at the same time. So maybe you can just like choose the s same window for transcription and summary. Yeah. Yeah. Tabs are nice. I like tabs. Yeah. I don't know how easy it is. But I dunno, but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or just, I don't know. Yeah, uh change the contents of the same window, like from transcription to summary. Probably yeah. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. That could probably No, no, it could be like transcription summary, like two buttons and you just press on which ever you want. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like pop-ups. I guess that yeah. Yeah. He's close. Yeah, um well could uh I don't know. Would transcripts uh b sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then. Like full meeting, meeting without disfluencies, and summarise. Yeah. Um yeah. I guess it is. I mean just to try it and I mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so eas yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just so see the integration works sort of between the different compo Um So I guess that's what we need to aim for. Yeah. Yeah. Well if I guess I mean that was probably our intention, but we might not have written it down. So I guess I know. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Say that again, O_ four. Oh yeah. Mm. Okay. I could tell you what I done in S_P_ two. Oh um I don't know. I basi I s started like browsing a bit, just like trying to see if there's anything out there to use s sort of um just yeah, searching, yeah well yeah. We're doing the. Yeah, yeah. So it just found a tutorial but i inverted search in indexing, but I haven't read it yet. But Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well I don't know if it's usable. I uh can have a look th at it. But but I found some code for like from a tutorial about i indexing. Uh whatever. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um yeah, I guess that's it. I don't know. Uh I'm I was a bit worried about when well when he talked about this with the mm file messing around with files. I mean uh how much do we actually need to do. Like extracting things from the X_M_L_ files and stuff to be able to do the indexing? Okay. Okay. What are you writing in Java or yeah, okay. Yeah. you know a bunch about file things. Um yeah, I guess I mean it was a good point you had that like collaborating with the file things. I mean if you already started on on doing your stuff, I guess we can Yeah. Yeah. Should we, I don't know, meet up and see what we could do? I mean, I don't know, see what you've done and see what we need when we know more of what we need maybe? Or what do we need. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Well Yep. Oh. Um Yeah, we're gonna meet up. Yeah. 'Cause it's now Okay. Okay. But it what what is it like a window where you have to wr write the search query? Or is it just what's behind it? So or how does it work then? D Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. When you like you is there a open thingy or Like well what did you two do to like how did you figure out that this uses N_X_T_ search like is it Okay. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh no. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. I don't know. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. That's nice. Sorry. I'm just being yeah. Hmm. Have we these courses that we're okay. Yeah. No. I don Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. Mm. I don't know. Mine was The progress report is due on twenty third February. February. Um yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just looking at my own deadlines. See. Yeah, that would be fine.. Wasn't like what you had now, wasn't that pretty much what we agreed on? Or was it just like that one. Okay. This is illusion or whatever. Oh mm. Nice thought. I'm impressed. Maybe you should make it exist then. Yeah. Yeah. It would be nice to, I don't know, meet up and uh you can sort of show us a bit what you know already, so we don't sort of have to do all the work again of just like figuring out stuff. Just like accessing the corpus and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah yeah. Yeah. Um yeah. Yeah. Next yeah, this Monday. Just Yeah. It's full, yeah. Yeah. Well, it doesn't matter for me. I mean three three or after what? Maybe we ca In four Buccleuch. We can go look we can look at now, afterwards. Yeah. Okay. Into what? Okay uh. Yeah. Oh, is that the photo-copier I heard I heard about? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what time do we say? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Hmm. What? It's true. Yeah, I don't know. It's reading week next. It should be it shouldn't be any well, it's supposed to be next week. It's week six next week. I don't know. We have one class at least when we like speech perception, we don't have any lectures. But I think we're having like all other classes. So uh there's not point in having No, I think it w Yeah, which are a bit crap, yeah. I think the under-graduates had uh all were off totally. What? Yeah, th we will probably have it, yeah yeah. last week. Yeah. Yeah, um I guess that's it. Was there anything else? Do anyone know you wanna like take care of this or should I take care of it? Yeah. I don't know if there was something. Oh I think he basically said um the same things as in the comments, if I could read it. Can you read that? Yeah. From a single application Yeah. Well, uh that was, I guess. Oh. No. Oh yeah. Yeah? And now we have seven percent of the course already done? Is quite good. So if y If you're okay with uh having Oh. Who? Yeah.. We're done now. I uh Is she still here? Yes, you are. Yeah.
Funky sh stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. Look at all this stuff man. Okay. Right. Has anybody Has anybody done anything? You better start. Good at this. Right. D yeah. The l the left-click or the right-click. Right. Yeah, it might be quite good, I suppose. Yeah. What else could we have in the menu? Okay. So otherwise you just have a right-click or do you have have a Is a window. A menu, yeah yeah. Yeah, it's why. And so it might be a bit weird the fir to just start bringing up stuff and then it Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's more It's more idiot proof, isn't it. It's got a button. Add more buttons. Yeah. Well in uh I guess in in In meeting browser one point one, you can have a menu instead of a button but this why I don't think it Yeah. Yep. I guess so. So what did you part of the m the menu that comes down, it says give me all your meetings or something. Yep. I guess so. It's an idea. Get to use my pen. Yeah yeah. Oh yeah. We have to have a speaker characterisation first before we cross any of the other bridges. So yeah, there you go. Yeah. Alright. Why not. Even if only one thing comes up. Okay. So and so this lot is for um On the t speaker. And then this lot is on th What was that? I didn't quite understand. Do you mean Yeah. Oh, so and it figures out what's the most common use to double-click. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Sometimes you do it by accident though. You, oh go away. Stop coming up. Yeah. No. Yeah, yeah, oh yeah. T throw stuff throwing out the window. Yep. We don't know yet do we, I don't think. Do you mean the single channel? Probably not, but we might need them for disfluencies, if we try do it in audio. But at the moment, no. But yeah. We might want to be able to say oh, just give me what that person's saying. Unless um you can't hear it properly or something. Somebody's talking over somebody else or something. Well p W we just say no for now and put it in later or something. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, 'cause otherwise it will the it will increase the amount of data we need by a lot, won't it? Therefore print will be bigger. Yeah. No, I think it's I think it's fine. Yeah. I think what we're doing is fine. Yeah, tabs are good. Mozilla style. Yeah. Does anybody know how to do that? Or can you do that in Java? I don't think Java knows how to do that really. Maybe yeah, you probably can. But but If you really knew what you're doing. But I don't know. It's a bit of a cripple with Java's windowing tool-kit. The eight is sometimes it's a bit of a cripple. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that will reduce the number of um windows we needed, wouldn't it? Which is quite good. 'Cause otherwise Photoshop has a lot of windows, if you ever use Photoshop it's got loads, and you're always g forever going no, get out of the way. There's always stuff in the way, isn't there. So Yeah. You do, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Unless, can you I don't suppose you can minimise them and stuff like that Can you can you do that? Okay, well it's alright then. Yeah. Of course you can actually, yeah, it's got everything. Yeah, sounds good. Um Yeah, that's what we need, yeah. Something just slightly more than just that on its own. Yep. Yep, definitely. I think that's kinda as well, isn't it really? Seeing it seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be a prototype with a GUI. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You can make it if you make it world readable, then anybody can access it. Yeah. No, uh i i it no, they're not world-readable. It not the default they're only default then only you can read them by default. You can see them but you can't read them. Yeah. What's your number? Okay, your number. Okay. And then it's N_L_S_S_D_. The M_ browser, for meeting. Hope you hope you never have to look in my directory. It's just pure chaos. S Mine is serious chaos. Files everywhere. Don't all jump at once. Yeah. Yeah, what was on it. Oh you found some code for it. For the inde Alright. Alright. Cool, cool. So even if it doesn't work, you can jiggery pokery around and make it work. Y yeah. Yeah yeah. All sorts of nonsense. But yeah. By the basics is uh oh okay, that's good. Yeah. I've been trying to g write something to read the X_M_L_ and get rid of it. And I can get rid of it, but I'm having trouble putting it anywhere else. So it will come up on the screen For the moment I haven't managed to put it into a vector or whatever in Java to play with it. But I guess it's not very difficult. Yeah, in Java, yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah, I'm sure they do. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah, I will. I'm sure it's nothing difficult. I'm sure I'm making a meal of it at the moment actually. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely, yeah. Should share as much as possible. Yeah Yep. Next week sometime, yeah. I actually haven't done anything this week 'cause this week's been manic. But well, whatever it was, last week then. The the the week as it as is rather than the proper week, do you know what I mean. Do you know that, it's been all a bit manic, the last m the last yeah. Yeah, that's right, yeah. And then we had to do an I_R_P_, whatever it was last week as well. Which is only a page long, but it's quite difficult to write a page. More diffi it was, it wasn't marked, but it was I had to sit there and think about it for a bit, which is a bit irritating. Yeah, but S_P_N_L_P_. Yeah. Yep. So when it when it That's pretty bizarre, isn't it? Well I guess that's how it works. They've got d That is pretty bizarre. Yeah, yeah. That is pretty bizarre. Wh Four, and it w it li it just has an open variable transparent s list, whatever, find everything that's got that and then load Yeah. Yeah, yeah, 'cause that's the uh the declares a variable, doesn't it, and then they keep Okay. Right. Oh see, obvious So did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it, is that what you did? Right. Okeydoke. Fish the data, I was just thinking that, yeah. Mm. Have you annotated your code nicely? Not yet. Just in case. mission critical. Yeah. Commen commenting it out one bit at a time and running it, does it work, yeah. Okay, get rid of that, next. Good fun, aye. So basically we go and go and do some work really, I think that's the um the um the answer to that, isn't it. The long and the short of it. Yeah. Proba I'm still at the bottom of the mountain. Yeah. Well, should you find you want to explore any other perhaps you as your um uh quantify raising. You saw it, yeah. So what courses should I pick to be not doing any work at the moment? Yeah. Oh, so it's uh, yeah. Yeah, me too. Um. So so what's that, two weeks basically. Ish yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's it's quite impressive actually. Yeah. That's quite slow really. Yeah. No, it's not, is it? Yeah. Can take us for a tutorial sometime. Next week sometime. Mm Monday afternoon. Uh Three is alright. It was what time's D_N_L_G_? Four, isn't it? Three's good though. I'll but we have s whatever. What's you what would you prefer? We could three thirty in the in the computer room in here, and then we can just go stra if you can't can you get in the front door? Oh, you haven't got a key, do you? Can none of you get in there? The k the f there's computer rooms in here, the M_S_C_ computer lab and uh is in here. Well if you find me, I'll show you where I'll I'll let us all in there, and we can all go in there. Yeah, yeah. You do need to have a key for it. Like that's the thing. It's got a lock door button. Yeah, somebody will answer it. Yeah, it's only got it's crap, it's only got about four or five computers in But it would do quite good for our job, 'cause it has not very uh p not many people in it very often. Yeah, there's fridge there. And there's a photo-copier with the code on it, yeah yeah. It's cool, yeah. Oh right. Yeah, yeah. Hopefully it's not that man, so it won't matter. Some classes did and some classes didn't. It's all a bit bizarre really. They didn't really know what was going on. Nah, make 'em work. Done. Oh, we trust you. Yeah, I think the comments are basically the same as what you said. So it's Yeah. Oof. Bu buzzes. Yeah. Signing off, innit? Log off.",EN2002a
"Smile for the camera. Helium one. I think there should be a break for and. But I think maybe that one should be underlined. Helium. M_B_D_A_ presumably is lambda. And the in that case. Yep. Yep. Right, what's different? Just this. High excitation emission lines. I think high excitation should be in because it's just saying It's talking about the species that the emission lines are coming from. Living up in nebulosity. ESO, I don't think is an instrument. Okay. To not yes, to keep hubble. Um for this that should be green as well. Well it is the whole name yes, I get Absorption line systems shouldn't be there. Absorption line systems. And again. Needs column densities, which is a derived property. But then Mm-hmm. And Lyman alpha cloud shouldn't be in there either. Right. No. For some reason I seem to have just died on this one. He got bored. You're right there. Yes. I've labelled that wrong. And here again. Um it is. But is emission line A_G_N_ a separate class from A_G_N_? I don't think it is. I think A_G_N_ You wouldn't talk about But I don't think you'd particularly class them as a separate source. A separate source class. Maybe you would. Mm, I didn't it, I just looked at the plu And I guess there is a difference between uh an A_G_N_ with emission lines and one without, esp especially if it's X_ ray detected. So yeah, I'm happy with that as long as that's red as well, which it is. Um No. Oh, galactic stars. I think you're r you're right again there. G_ dwarf. Presumably. Never met one, but don't know what it is. Right. Oh, is it? There you go.. And cluster, you're right. Absorption But it's the same Lyman alpha forest systems again. So you're right there. Or there maybe there shouldn't be any yeah, I think should still be absorption. Radio loud quasar again. You're right. I should definitely now we had a debate about this before, and I can't remember why I decided to mark associated. Um what does it mean? What is as associated absorption? Doesn't say it's associated with what. I don't know. I've got no idea what it means. Yeah. Right, okay. So is that what it means in that c context? Right. Um and associated again. Mechanisms. Quasar. And we should've s put emission line features, shouldn't we? But we're not supposed to mark things we've done differently. So We've just talked about n und underlining features. It doesn't say in the manual about features or not, but we d when we saw ones previously, we marked features. Um yes. The only problem, it's done if we've both been not marking it, there might be other instances in the text where it's not marked. Mm-hmm. Right, okay. Yeah. Yes, we've got quasars. And this is exactly the same as last one. systems. I_M_ galaxies. Is it? Okay. Hubble deep fields is being marked. And absorption shouldn't be marked, yep. I don't think able cluster is different from cluster. Hmm. An able cluster is just a a discover Yeah. Soft excess. Yep, okay, we can have soft excess. Mm-hmm. And yes, you're wrong 'cause that's you're right 'cause that's extended emission and Compton emission. I think you're right on both of them. Um X_ ray B_L_X_ and radio B_L_X_ I think are because the B_L_ within should be marked, So No continuum. C_O_ luminosity. Mm-hmm. Oh it's still too hot. Um Intermediate is a region. It shouldn't be highlighted, you're right. Because if if we talk about the broad line region, we're not supposed to highlight it. It's the same, it's just it's not very clear before the so-called. Um Yeah, just galaxies. Star bursts. Yes, they do. Oh. Yes, assuming you're talking about star burst galaxies rather than star burst within a galaxy. But they are talking about star burst galaxies. And galaxies. Mm continua or continuum flux. It's another one of those that doesn't really make a big difference. But what did we decide? Let's keep flux in because it in most of these cases we've put flux in. And the same as feature. Broad line. I was gonna say put it in. Um The lack of broad line polarization. Broad line polarization, is that a spectral feature? I think you'd want the whole thing in some extent. Ts you can't get it just from a spectrum. But you can if you've got a spectrum that's split by polarized light. As it is. Polarization's a property. Yes, okay. Yep. Now I d don't know what was marked here. Have you got the bottom of this page? Or is it cut off? No. I said that weak line was. Because the modifier should be included, which I think it should. Even though we claim radio galaxies i this should be underlined. This should be green. Oh right, okay. Are we the same on the bottom line? Okay, so the question is oh no, it's different. Oh I've got line, that's fine. Line comes out and and should come out as well. So there's a right but I think weak line should be in. Bec i in the same way that if you had broad line it would be in there. Right. Yes. Mm okay. Um line again. But we've got emission line in the ratios. That's fine. Infrared galaxies. That's right again. Oh no, is it? No, it's wrong. Yeah. I'll get this. Line. And that's it. Making emission feature, which we're including now. Mm-hmm. Star forming galaxies No, we can't. Star forming galaxies should be in. Yeah. Proto-galactic lump. W Not gonna get away with that one. It's a lump. It's something. Emission feature again. Damp Lyman That should be because it's not an absorber, it's an absorption. Oh, covers, yeah. Yeah, you cross 'em out. Features. A feature again. Is a feature a spectral feature. damped Lyman alphas again. Yeah. after and the rest is the same. Now a line should be in. X_ ray B_ L_. Intermediate. We put in type type one point nine. Yes, I think it should be in. Mm-hmm. Oh gosh, this looks complicated. Oh it's just it's Lyman alpha absorption. And we don't like that one. And we don't like that one. Yes we are taking out line on its own. So we ha yes. Every time Yes, I think we have to take in general every time there's been line where's there been line? Okay, it's line width, but it's st it's still where it says lines. Have we had any just where it says line ratios? Mm. Yes, I think you're right. No. We want the whole thing in there. Or in the U_V_. I don't think spectrum should be there. But if it's a wave length or a wave band we were putting it in. Yeah. Yep, you're right. Line centre you can point to. Not like line width, but you can point to line centre. In fact the whole thing should be highlighted, I think. You can point to the line wings. Mm that's just a Yep, no that shouldn't be in there. Mm you're right, star burst. Oh, star burst active star burst like activity, that's I don't think that's a class. It's a action. But A_ g but a an A_ an A_G_N_ is a class. A star burst is a type of galaxy, but it's also something that can happen within a galaxy. It's But an A_G_N_ is an object. The star burst, you can't say here is a star burst. can't star burst if it means galaxy. If this means star burst galaxy like activity, then that's fair enough. But star burst refers to Mm. I can see that. Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's keep it in. I I think you're right anyway. Mm-hmm. Yes, I think it was ma maybe if it was star forming like activity, that would be different. But yeah. Yes, that's right, but star burst is different. Okay. Um we've just got this split up. I think there should be w H_ You're right, it's two. It's a wave length region, but it's tilt but you're saying between that line and that line. Um You are, yes. That's all part of the name. Line ratios? But galaxy should be in. So we need to write that. Um hold on. Oh no, they are the same. Sorry, I missed that. Absorption line systems. Hubble. And hubble. And galaxy. Galaxy distribution. Still the distribution of galaxies. Um high ionization lines? Yes. Mm-hmm. Open that radius button. Yes, don't include Platt's spectrum. Quasars. Low ionization. Mm but three should be in. Um low ionization, th they're low BALs, aren't they? Low BAL is a separate class of source. Um, I I don't know if high BALs are, but low BALs are. Oh right, yeah. Yeah. I shouldn't you're right there. Emission line candidates. Yes, you're right. Continuum I think should be in, aren't they? Although I was talking about conti yeah, continuum luminosity continuum flux, it should be in. I thought we had, we'd put in Mm-hmm. Yeah, we weren't doing broad band detections. We were doing yeah. This is nice tea. Now what were we doing if It And what were we doing Um I don't know, 'cause you in language speak, mark each as a separate entity. That's different. Mark sub-sections of entities t no, that's different. Doesn't really say. So we need a rule for that. What have we done t Z_ equals two. Yeah. As one, okay. Let's whatever's easiest for you. Y Um yes, take it out., isn't it? The spectral components. X_ ray binaries. Hubble deep field again. Emission line objects shouldn't be in either of them. Radio quiet quasar should be go mm I think that's right. Now you've done one and not the other. And you're right because one's line formation and one's line profile. I_G_M_ I've done again. This is nice and easy. Components. Um Mm-hmm. But we want the line still. The galaxy or galaxy? Given that it is the galaxy. It should be the galaxy, I guess. Insert proper whatever the word is.. H_V_C_, is it this? Known to lie in the direction of high velocity clouds. That's where they are. They shouldn't be in there. Yes, but they don't explain. I_C_M_. Scuba. Sometimes anyway when it works. Um No, but no, you're right, and this should be red as well. It should all be. Narrow line A_G_N_ are different. I missed out that. H_ beta l width. So Just keep H_ beta, I think. Given that we're not putting line width itself. Even line if it is line width. You can have flux. H_ beta should be in. Not that line, but we want enhanced. We we wanted, and this is relative, we wanted modifiers of modifiers of spectral lines, E_G_ weak broad lines. I weak w relative to what though? It's all relative, but it's still a modifier of that line. And the same Um No, only when it's embedded. Oh, but the second one. Oh, it's included beside mark it all as one entity, yes. Yes, I don't know how many times I've missed the. Um weak emission I think should be in there. Mm. If we're including it, emission Um No, that's true, so we shouldn't have done either of those. But then weak yeah, okay, nothing at all. That's not a separate source. Red continuum should be in. Broad line emission and the rest frame U_V_ should all be one. You're right, yeah. Oh. No, it shouldn't. Oh yes, sorry, you're right. Lines. Yes, that's true. Associated again, which means nothing. Continuum source shouldn't be in. And associated shouldn't be in. C_T_I_I_O_. What does it stand for? That is a separate thing. Y yeah. Yes, but it's also a telescope, and I think he if there's no other way of describing it, that telescope The C_T_I_O_ four metre telescope is must be what it's called. Otherwise they'd call it a name. Um We're including observatory if it refers If it's part of the proper name of an instrument. Yes, up the telescope? No, just four metre. Ion shouldn't be in there. Oh no, it should. Iron and absorption. Is it contamination from blended iron and absorption lines? No, it's not. It's no, it's not. I if the comma wasn't there, it would be in. So they do mean iron line. So so it should be in. And we're keeping line in 'cause its strengths, yeah. Continuum flux we should have all in. G oh. There're gonna be hundreds of those. Least it's quick. Um I don't think that's a separate class of quasar. But then I don't know about quasars. I think it should p Yeah. That's okay. Um the A_W_D_ s. Mm white dwarf? Um. Okay, so it is a different class. Okay. Nope. Low BAL. Mm I'd put multiple in there. We're not supposed to do components. I say neither of them. Or yeah, that's right. No absorption lines. That should be highlighted. Oh sorry, I'm I me Yeah, I don't thin I don't think there was s but Mm only if it's an astro-physically distinct distinct Okay. No absorption lines should be in, and the same here. I didn't. Nice not to do associated for once. I you're Y yes, you shouldn't. And we w oh gosh, what were we gonna to do about A_ and again? Yes, you are right, yeah. Strong soft X_ ray flux. Yeah, you can point to that. And that's associated absorption lines. And absorption and small clouds is out. Ah, now this is the conjunct rule again. And I've done blue wings of this and this and this. And this is one double line. And this. And presumably that's red there. It goes over there. I think i if the line's too long, y you've highlighted all i as one. But and I've highlighted it separately. It should be separate. I think if the line's too long, it's only ha putting the bottom line because Olivia would've marked from blue all the way to the end as one long line. Yes, but I think it probably was and just hasn't printed because Olivia wouldn't have started marking at fourteen O_ two. Almo two lines above. Yeah, but I think it's just m missing out the printing if the line goes over the end. 'Cause if you look at you look at what Olivia's done here, Olivia wouldn't have just highlighted that line. She would have highlighted the whole thing. Yeah, and it's just hasn't printed that. But it is marked I think. Mm-hmm. Shouldn't be. But it's al is that also the name of the source? So it should be this one plus the pink. Line broadness, and I think that should be in. That's true. Well okay yeah. So we've been in here. Alright. my table for now. Rich iron spectrum. You're probably right. To the feature of the spectrum. Does that make it a spectral feature? Um It's a feature of the whole spectrum rather than you can't say there is a rich iron spectrum, you can say this is a rich iron spectrum. Yes, it's not a spectral feature. It's feature of the spectrum, which is different. Yes. And then with the same. Gosh, we're getting through this now. Um giant ellipticals or ellipticals. We were inclu are you not They are separate, but are they a separate class? I think they probably are in the ETA B_T_G_s and things. Ionized emission. Yes, I think you want ionized in there. You can point to ionized emission rather than Hmm. Emission from high excitation lines. Yeah. It it's pointing there and saying, look, there's a high excitation emission. And there's not high excitation. K Mm-hmm. Line ratio. What's different there? Oh there, yes. Narrow line Seyfert one should all be one. With the red inside it. That Yeah. It's describing the line you're looking for. We've included it before when you've said this has been detected. From I think should be in there. E emission lines. Quasars I missed. Damped Lyman also is not systems, yeah. Mm no, I think it's a spectral feature. You can point to the damped Lyman a alpha resorption, in in the same way you can point to H_ beta emission, although H_ beta emission is a process. Or emission from H_ beta is is a process. No, the damped Lyman alpha absorption systems we crossed out. We also crossed out What did we do back Mm you can point to low red shift damped Lyman alpha absorption 'cause you're shifted in the spectrum there. Um would it be if it was H_ beta absorption? And you just took out the low red shifts. Quasars with H_ beta absorption you'd put in. Because it's a spectral feature. I think damped Lyman alpha absorption I think it's both. Because we've every feature is produced by a process. Yes, it's depends whether it has t whether it means with low red shift damped Lyman alpha cloud absorption. If it was damped Lyman alpha absorbers, that would be different. But I think absorption It's a process, but it also produces a spectral feature, where you can say there's the damped Lyman alpha absorption, there's the in the same way that the, yeah, H_ beta emission is a process. Yeah, I think it should be in there. Micro-quasars. They're dubbed micro-quasars. Is it gonna be a decent source type in the future? I haven't heard referred to since. But But just talk about the micro-quasar. Yeah, I think you're right, they have ma Mm on the other hand if we're having hyper-luminous galaxies where, you know, they've just got ultra-luminous and oh, even more hyper-luminous. Well someone must have made that up for the first time. I think Same as a hyper-luminous galaxy being very very extreme. I reckon a dwarf amorphous nuclei star burst galaxy, a dance, is a Yeah, okay. But what about the acronym because that's has that should be in. star burst nuclei. You're right. Oh. The object. If it was star burst galaxies, it would be in there. Star burst nuclei refers to a region within an object which would not be observed separately. Um Okay. Because the acronym has star burst in it uh galaxies in it, in the S_, and if the acronym includes its Then it has to be in there. Continuum flux you can have. U_V_ and optical emission line ratios. But U_V_ and optical emi U_V_ and optical emission should be in there though. No, it shouldn't 'cause it it modifies the ratios. Oh gosh, no emission l okay, so I've highlighted this in r red and then the whole thing in green because type two Seyfart galaxies are one. So I think that's right, as long as this is T_V_ gamma ray emission. We weren't doing broad-band detections, yeah? Using the. It is, yes. Very stupid, but it is. F_B_S_ objects shouldn't be in there. I don't know, but it's got object. And the MAMA scanning machine is an instrument, it's not a telescope, it's an instrument. Oh yes, it should be. Narrow emission lines from high iron yeah. Absorption features. Weak continuum. That should be separate. Continuum radiation. Neither. Mm-hmm. Yep. Oh, there's emission from the narrow line region, yeah. Narrow line emission should be in. F_V_ low BAL is a source type. Stupid Keckers. You used to b oh no, Keck observatory. Yes, we did decide Keck was going in. At all, yep. And we shouldn't allow emission. Radio quasars? Yeah. Oh, no, radio loud and radio quiet are.. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Um Ye I think they're a separate class, yes. We're not putting them in spectral, but I think we are putting them in because it's so broad band. But yes, they are separate. No, you can't point to it, yeah. Missed group. Subaru telescope, you're right. It's under a proper name 'cause it's got a capital T_. Wonderful. Well once we've got them identified, a lot of them were the same problem going round and round. Um where's the bin in here? And more to the point, can I get to it without going ah, I can carry my little bits in the with me. Excuse me, camera, I need to find the bin. Um and there isn't one, is there?
Cheers. It should be this one here. Do you reckon this stands for lambda or yeah, okay. I forgot to keep track of the overall score, like who wins and who lose. Mm-hmm. Well, w within the sentence that you sort of currently looking at um feel free to correct it that way that you'll do you know like it's not only about resolution but it's sort of like coming up with a corrected version based on these, yeah. Have you do you've seen that there are the other one there, the quasar, right? The uh right, sorry. Mm-hmm. Oops, no. Or actu actually sorry, I think um the um this cut up page continues in the next side. Yeah. Characterised by unusually No, is it? Hmm. Yeah. And give it an acronym. G_B_H_C_, ooh. get this out of the way. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Wait, fr from the linguistic side, if you if you mark star burst before and if you feel that star bursts are like objects, then I think it sh it should stay in in this case, even though it's modified by activity, or it's it's m modifying activity actually. Hmm. Is is goo again or is it really Z_ equals two? Mm-hmm. Alright. Mm-hmm. If it was radio-loud quasar, then you would mark it as one thing? I I think it makes sense to um mark the whole thing then as one. I don't know what you feel. But Um so sorry, and the the A_G_N_, I think that should be one entity, right? The the uh w wasn't it that according to the uh acronym rule, the first one? Mark the la la. Mark the whole string as one entity. One acronym. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. What what's this N_ thing? Because that is not marked in the No, sorry, I mean the um so so most the Right. Hmm. Yeah. But Yeah. But it's s so you're mostly settling uh settling for for the uh solution where you mark all contacts individually. Right. Something that you can point to, right? Or Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh, I see. So in that sense it's like like a derived property. Yeah, I see, uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Hmm. Sorry, what what happened now? So you you f you found that dwarf amorphous blah blah galaxies, that that's not a proper name? But you still include the acronym? Or Oh okay. Alright, okay. I see, mm-hmm. Hey, wow. Under two hours. Amazing. Yeah. I th I think so, yeah.
Hello. Right. Mm mm hmm. Yeah, it's hard to know what that is. That's this is a bit of H_T_M_L_ goo. I think there should be a break for and. And they don't know what to do with the H_T_M_L_ goo. But this this isn't a s yeah. And this isn't a separate thing, so I w I would agree that you underline the you underline the goo in each case but not the and. Right? Yeah. Okay? Mm mm-hmm. Mm. Yes. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Right, you don't get that. ESO isn't an instrument. You're right. We agreed for to keep hubble. Yep. Yeah, that should be a source type, yeah. It's Yeah, do you think that's part of the name, yeah. I don't yeah, I have no way of knowing, yeah. Yep. Yep. Right. Mm yeah. Yep, that's fine. Nope. I win. Uh Okay. Yeah, I know. Is there a prize at the end? Bottle of champagne. Um okay. Mm that's a spectral feature, that's okay. Ye Emission line A_G_N_. You can get A_G_N_ without emission lines. I think in Phil's paper he does, doesn't he? The paper I pointed you to a few weeks ago or last week. I didn't know what he meant, but yes. I've seen people talk about them as separate classes, but I don't really know what that means. Yeah. Yep. Oh. Mm 'kay. Yeah, that G_ dwarfs are things, aren't they? That's alright, yeah. I saw it yesterday. Uh yeah. There he is. By Lyman alpha forest and Lyman limit systems. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Emission models, definitely not. Um why associated? Yeah. It means it's associated with some physical thing, but it doesn't have anything to do with the spectral features, I don't think. Does it? Mm-hmm. I'm happy to say M_ two what-not absorption is a spectral feature. But associated means it's associated to some physical thing. So yeah. So that shouldn't be in. Alright. Yep. Those are mechanisms. So they don't count. Don't think. Um Yep, I just missed it. And that's it. Hmm? Yeah, we should do. Yeah, we did that the same. But it's different from what we've been doing. Yeah. Yeah, and it's not in the manual, is it? Yeah. So let's do that. Extend. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Yep. It's a kind of a regular galaxy? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Ri right. That definitely gets to go in. That's not a component. I think. Yeah, we could come to blows over soft excess. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I agree. That's fine. No. No, for continuum. Um. Yeah, that's fine. Uh I can agree with taking that out. That the so-called yeah, I don't think it should be, should it? 'Cause it's a region, yeah. Yep. Yeah, it's badly written. Infrared galaxies. We said not to mark things based solely on So it's just defined only by wave-length. So we can't include infrared galaxies. And star bursts count, surely. Mm yes, yeah, they are. Galaxies. Mm. It doesn't really matter. I'd say continuum flux but I don't Obviously. But I don't care. Yep, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm no, I'm happy to take that out. Oh. Mm no you can't point to it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Mm. Uh we're missing weak weak line.I don't oh y so they're saying weak line radio galaxies are a separate class of radio galaxy. Okay, yeah. Okay. Right. Oh. Yeah no, you've got line in there. M And should come out. Okay, mm-hmm. Yep, that's okay. Galactic black hole candidates. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think that's a source type. Mm mm-hmm. Yep. No, it's not right. Right. Uh line emitting gas I don't like, yeah. Far infrared galaxies we can't have. That's okay. Yeah, that's okay. Damped Lyman alpha absorption the same. Right, yep. Emission feature. Yeah, that can't be in. Yep. Uh yes, it should be. Yep, that should be in. That is not a source type. What were you thinking? Yeah. Dibulae absorption. No, but it says it covers a significantly small angular size. It's a physical thing. Yep. Uh this feature. Yeah, okay. Alpha. Yeah, you don't get that. Do you? Those are those are regions, globs, nebulae. Yep. Yeah. X_ ray B_L_ lax. Yep, that's okay. Intermediate types. It now if we're d Did we in the end? Yeah? Oh right. You get it then. That doesn't go in and that's okay. Right, that's okay. We don't like systems. Yeah, that's okay. Are we? Okay, yep. What line are we taking out? Line width, yeah. Line ratios. We've been taking out line as a word that relates to other words. My head is going yeah. But lines are still lines. Yeah, that's okay. Right, I agree that that can go out 'cause that's a fitting thing. Absorption features in the U_V_ spectra. Okay. It's likely one spectrum in the U_V_ which you can see absorption features in. Uh Right. Quasars quasars. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm right. And here I think I'm right again.? Line centre. Yeah, you'd you'd say line wings. Alright, you get it. Right, you win. Um eclipsing I don't think. Yeah, you're right there. Y yeah, but then the A_G_N_ like activity. So both of them have to go. A star burst is a class. An A_G_N_. But we're counting star bursts as star burst galaxies. No, but a star burst galaxy is only a galaxy which has a star burst in it. Like an A_G_ an active galaxy is just a galaxy with an A_G_N_ in it. Yeah. I think they're the same. They either have to both stay or both go, and I I think they should stay. Yeah. Star formation we weren't putting in. That Or was it's a wave-length region. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm right here. That's part of a name, yeah. Mm 'kay. Infrared galaxies. This time you have it. But galaxies should be in. Right. Uh oh, what have we done? Hubble. Yeah, ok i in the galaxy distribution. Yeah, okay. Mm. Yeah, we did it before. Yeah, that's okay. Oh. Yeah, okay. We weren't doing spectral shapes, were we? Yeah, that counts. Mm-hmm. Well Yeah, that's true. That counts. They are and it's a big joke. High balls. Uh yeah. Um next. Yeah. Yeah, that doesn't go in. That means objects that are identified and maybe at a particular red shift based on it. Yeah. That doesn't count. Mm continuum luminosities. I don't remember about luminosities. We've been putting in continuum flux. Yeah. Mm. Mine too. Oh. Radio loud quasar should be in, Z_ equals two shouldn't. The rule was to leave it in, was it? Yeah, that's for things marked with and. Yeah, it doesn't say. Z_ equals two is um means at a certain distance. Um so that shouldn't be in, but radio loud quasars is a thing. So it's whether to include the Z_ equals two in the Yeah. Oh. No. Yeah. No. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm no, we can't have that. Yep. A source type. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Um right. Yes. Um yeah. Yeah. We can rid of that, can't we? Galaxy with the galaxy. It should be the galaxy, yeah. H_V_C_ complexes. I don't know what H_V_C_ stands for, but since they're complexes we can cross it out. Huh? Do you know what H_V_C_ stands for? Yeah, that doesn't count. Mm-hmm. Scuba, that's an instrument. You're right there. Should be this and it probably is, that's probably what that means. Oh, I see. Yeah. Right. Beta line.. I don't think that matters very much. Okay. Hurray. Um oh, beta, yep. Mm no. Do we? But enhanced relative to what? Okay. But when yeah. Oh, I don't think I was doing that. Yeah, I've missed that a lot. Yeah. Okay. Oh yeah, extended emission is extended. We we've not been including extended emission. So Yeah. Weak emission levels is just a way of saying yeah, I agree. Done. Star burst contribution. Yeah, that's true. Red continuum. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that should be out. We weren't doing components. So Yeah, this is this a radio transfer thing. So they don't mean they mean photons in the lines escape. Not that that's not something you can point to. I don't think that counts. Mm. Uh-uh. Mm that should be oh wait, is that s that's an observatory, isn't it? The C_T_ is the C_T_I_O_ four metre uh the name of that telescope? No. And the A_A_T_ is an observatory as well, isn't it? So Yeah. But we if we put Yeah. But then we have to include four metre as well. No. Yeah. Right. Yep, I agree. Mm-hmm. What is that comma doing there? Yeah, no oh, I see, I see, I see, yeah. Accounting for galactic reddening contamination from blended iron. What they mean is blended iron lines. Yeah. Continuum fluxes, yeah, we're doing that, yeah. No. Uh yeah. Damped Lyman alpha Q_S_O_. Uh I don't know what that means either. One damped Lyman alpha Q_S_O_s. It's not a source type, that's definitely true. So What's D_A_? And there's W_D_s. It's twenty five of D_A_ type and six of D_B_ type. Yep. Yep. Yes, you're fine with that. Nope. Okay. Yeah. No luminos Yeah, low luminosity Q_S_O_s, no. People talk about them a lot, but Well we're doing ultra-luminous galaxies. So we should do Yeah. People discuss them as a separate class. They are as as much as ultra-luminous galaxies are. And yep, that should be in. Excellent. Regions. I shouldn't have done that. Oh, A_ and B_. No, that's the conjunctural. I'm right here, I think. If yeah. Yeah, that's okay. Uh Oh. Right. In the A_A_L_ outflow, it's a r yeah, that doesn't count. It doesn't count. And I didn't Ooh. How do you know what's going on here? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know what this means. Oh, I highlighted all as one, right. Okay, yeah. The N_ should be. Yeah, yeah. Mm. Hmm? Yeah. Oh, I see. So your N_ starts yep, yep, I see what you mean. Mm. So N_ probably should be highli Yep. Absorption components don't count. Continuum source, does that count? Shouldn't be. Mm oh so it is. That's right. Probably, yeah. Yep. Uh line broadness. That's a way of saying line width though, and we don't mark line width. Oh. Rich iron spectrum... Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yep, that's the rich iron spectrum. I agree, let's get rid of it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Right, that's not shouldn't go in. Is that everything? Yeah. Okay. Yeah yeah, we aren't gonna make it to our second cookie break. I don't mind. Are giant ellipticals separate things? I don't know. Yeah. Okay. Line emitting gas doesn't get in. If you're doing emission from high yeah. Hmm? Well she She was allowed emission from high excitation what-not. And that's exactly the same. Yeah, that's exactly the same as No. Well I'm not certain if high excitation should go in, but if high excitation should go in, I think ionized means the same thing, doesn't it? So Yeah, you're right. You've got X_ ray source R_ one seventeen. Mm-hmm. No, that's This is describing the band you do the observations in? Yeah, that counts? Alright. Right, okay. S S Yeah, okay. Yep. Yep. Ooh. Those shouldn't be there, should they? No. Oh okay, okay, okay. Ne yes. I think this is what we agreed to cross out before, isn't it? I think it's a process too, I think Especially when uh they're saying we're y we're choosing low red-shift absorption. That's not really something you can point to. Mm. I'm not too fast, I don't think. Mm no I'm not sure. It's whether it's a process or a a feature. But I can't remember what we've done before. Well if it was if it was absorption and damped Lyman alpha clouds, you'd not mark absorption. I do think it's a process, I think. Hmm? Mm? Well we've both marked it. So let's leave it there. Micro-quasars. Yeah. That means it's new-fangled. Yeah. Yeah, but they've made up that word. Yeah. But w do they what defines a micro-quasar? But. Uh yeah, you y there's not been more than one study of dwarf amorphous nuclear star burst galaxies. So that do we say we take that out? Yep, that's it in it. So that's okay, yep. Oh. Oops. Yep, that's fine. Mm-hmm. Yeah. We wouldn't have line ratios. So yeah, that goes. Yeah. No, it modifies ratios. Mm. Right. Yep, that's fine. Plus red. Yeah. We weren't doing broad-band detections. Right. That's definitely an instrument name. Right, you're right there. What does it mean? Yep, you're right. Yeah. Okay. So you can have that. Right. At the other one we stopped after four metre. So maybe we should do that there as well. Yeah. We did it this way before. Yeah, you're right. Continuum radiation. No. Neither. Narrow line region emission. Uh do you th I think that goes out. Yeah, we don't Yep. Uh yep, white dwarfs is a source type. Yeah, you're right. It is. Uh Keck is yeah. Uh we didn't allow iron spectrum. So we shouldn't allow H_ or helium two O_ spectrum either. Yeah. Iso-electronic. Yeah. Radio quasars are s type. But radio quasars means radio loud quasars. U_V_ accessors are right, isn't it? It's a spectral feature. We weren't doing flat spectrum quasars, were we? No. Were we? Right. Right. Uh you're right there. Line strengths. Means equivalent widths, yeah. Uh I did mis-group Yep. Hey. Excellent. Yeah. Hurray, we're done. Excellent. Yeah. No, you can't. Oh. Do we each remain wired up? Are we done? Excellent.
Great, thank you. Yep. Sorry, mm yep. Yeah. Uh yes, course, of course it is, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think it all is yeah, I think it is all m one name. Yep. Yeah, these are s s species ions again, not individual lines. It's not a competition. Uh Yeah, and this one. Um Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well it's one of them out um over here I think actually at the moment. So 'cause our sun is a is a T_ dwarf. Mm-hmm. Uh Well it's a process though, isn't it. Isn't it a process? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't have that. Well I think y bu y y you can actually mark it if it isn't altering what's in the manual. Uh um it's only altering earlier rules. That aren't allowed. Yeah, then then do, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Y yeah, yeah, but yeah. Yeah. Just a p what are you doing there there, sorry? Yep. Isn't remote. Yeah, fine. Um yeah, that's actually marked ex explicitly in here not to have A_ bar clusters. So yeah. No, I I'm I'm not arguing. I agree, yeah. Do you want this one here? No? Conti continuum. No, okay. I think that's a s species again. Yeah, I think you have. Yeah. Well n I think I would actually leave it um with only th on those Br broad l Line in it. Um because I think that's s what you have been doing earlier on. Yeah? Yeah? No. The difference only weak line, isn't it? Oh yeah. There's a line there as well. It's different. And an and. Different as well. They just made that up. That's yeah, exactly. That's not a source type. That's we did earlier anyway. So No, they just made that up as well. No. That's a process though. Yeah, it's a process or a source. I'm sorry. Yeah. Well hang on though. But wasn't there one just a minute ago in which only had a line? But you just Keeping lines there. So Adjective. Uh yes. Right. Okay, okay. Okay. Yeah, okay, fine. Yeah. Yeah. That has to go as well then, surely. A star burst is a class. As is an A_G_N_. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um are they uh if you say so. Okay. Okay. Well you haven't been earlier, have you? I don't think you were. Uh Have you? Oh okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I think so. Uh No. High velocity clouds. There. That's right. Why? Y yes, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Uh Really? If it was Are you? N No. No. Nor weak emission then. No. Oh yeah. Sorry. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Um m uh y ye well, I don't know. Yeah. But Hmm. That's the actually usually. But anyway. I don't mind. Yeah. I gue I guess keep it then. Yeah, I think so. Blended ion lines, yeah. Yes, you do mean ion lines. Yeah. No. Yeah, it's if it has h h Hydrogen or h helium in the atmosphere of white dwarfs. Yeah. No, that's right. That all goes. Yeah. I guess you could keep it then. Yeah. But it's a region though, isn't it. Ye ye the N_ as well. Uh yeah, Right. Yeah. Well kind of, it it's uh uh d if you had a s sp spectrum, you have all the l lines of actually lots of different elements, and you have to work out at all the ones sp which are ion lines. Then after that you look and say um ha has a lot of ion in it. Um But b yeah i That's right, it's it yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so. I think so. Yeah. Really? Really? You think? Okay, if you both think so. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Well hang on though, but um Is it just um to s scrub your mechanism there? It isn't uh a spectral feature such as oh, it's a process. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think it's a process myself. Yeah. Well that's true. That is true. Yeah. Yeah, okay, okay. I guess keep it probably, yeah. No, they've made that one up certainly. I've never heard of that one before. No. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I wouldn't, yeah. I think all of that goes then, doesn't it? Surely. No. No, I don't think anybody goes. Yeah. Mm no. It's an instrument, yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's it. Hurray. Well, very good. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's it, isn't it? We're done? Right.",EN2006b
"Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. It is the initialisation of. Yeah. But then it is iterative. Okay. So you you should first train the P_L_S_A_ stuff, then you initialise this link uh spreading thing, and then you iterate over okay. And it converge and so you have the boost uh initial P_L_S_A_ and P_L_S_A_ plus the link thing then. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. So th yeah, you you you were saying that you would like to evaluate that now. Yeah, right. Hmm. But but maybe you you could have some some other labelli li or the task like if if you imagine you have some labelling on of of the web pages like like like for example you you look at at at at at a set of pages, and you have the m the directory entries of these pages, so so f like Yahoo or entries, so you have categories and and entries, so for example you have I dunno, cars, S_U_V_, etcetera. So what you would like would be that two pages on in the same um category should be closer than than two pages being spread across different categories. But you you would not use this you will not use the Yahoo directory or n the directory in the training step of i of the model, okay. This is something you have just for evaluation, and then for example you you your task would be to say I have some page and and I know where it is in the in the in the directory, and I have another page, I don't know where it is, and I would like to to know uh whether it is in the same category as the first one, just by comparing their uh aspects. If they have the same uh yeah. So basically what you would like to check if is is is there some similarity in the in the in the aspect distribution, tells me uh something about uh the sim the the fact that they could be on the same category in the the this end end label categories. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No no no no no. How would So so so w what what you would have have basically would be to have a directory which give you labels for some part of the documents. Okay, so this is a directory and this is some some some some web page, okay. So the labelled one, okay. And you have some page which are unlabelled but you have links between those two. So what what you would do is that you would try and P_L_S_A_ and and uh and use a model over that. Then then you would like to for example what f what could be very simple would be just to then to match each pages like that. So let's say you have you have a a page which is labelled, and you say okay, the the label page two should get should be the one w which it is the most similar to, or any kind of classification rules you can imagine. And so and so you say okay, what what's if I from from this page which have the similar so so the the criterion would be to compare those two distribution, okay, and then and then you would like to assign to this document too where you don't know the labels the same one as this one. And and here, that you use only for test, so this is your. Then you can evaluate how wrong you are or cu how close you are from the real assignment, the right directory category. In this way I think it's fair if you kn if you know only if you know only that and that and what you would like to discover is this. This is a r like a real task. Like like if if if this directory uh uh company would like to extend this directory to new pages without the hassle of having human labelling. Yeah, you have t you use this one. You you only have the labels for some uh small part of the So So you you would train it you this is this is t t all all those links are known. The links between some labelled document and unlabelled document. I d I think you can do it as a two step process. First you you train uh well maybe s it wou could be better if if if you take it into account. But but maybe you can you can do just a two step process, first one you have this uh unsupervised task over both P_L_ and P_U_, and then you from these unsupervised starts you can know which document of P_L_ is close from the document of P_U_ or the reverse. And you can infer some label to a document of P_L_. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah, but Yeah. Yeah. But but here you can you you say given a random page of P_U_, which of those two model is more likely to to to to to say for example that thi the page of P_L_ which is the most similar, so you so so from this so you take any distribution comparison things, so so Hoffmann in his paper was doing just cosine similarity, but you can do anything. So so you just compare uh those two distributions so of D_ one and D_ two, okay? And so with that you can you can determine for example for a document o of the set two to the most similar So you you you you select D_ one so in this set which is the most similar to D_ two according to the distribution from one or the other model and then and then for this document you automatically assign to it the label of the document uh one and you check with this which is your uh your your if you are right or not. This is what what this is very related to what Frank did with the with the keyword uh image annotation. So you would have a set of keywords, the set of image label with keywords, and he has a set of unlabelled image with some, and it would check whether the the label he assigns, so in this case annotation word h are correct. And I think it's fair uh it's fair uh setup. So maybe this classification rule is not the best. There there's some might be some work to do, but the general idea, I think it's it's fair evaluations, it's a task. That can be dep Yeah. Yeah. No, but according to this directory yeah. yeah. I I I think it's w Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What's good with the directory is that you have a good coverage of various topic humans humans can label. But then if you want to detect different languages, this is another task. I think the task of this latent model is to discover some some semantic like some topic proximity between documents, and here this la this directory is doing the same thing, like associating some topics with some documents manually. So comparing them is is is is good setup with respect to the goal. I compare those two, like the P_L_S_A_ and the one over this same task of assigning good directory. I don't know if if it if it will provide good result result or not, but it is clearly a benchmark for those two goals. On on the infra yeah, yeah. Yeah. Like bag o yeah. Yeah, you can have tree setups, uh yeah. Yeah, basic cosine over the P_ of T_ given D_, so over all this uh empirical distribution. And the two uh aspect uh models. We have to repeat over and over. This is like advertisement. No no, it's joke. No, it's jus Yeah, yeah. This is really yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But the point is that the Z_ the the the aspect like the Z_ are are are come unsupervisely. It's it's more like if you were giving the people you you said to them okay, uh divide me this bunch of documents into five topics, and you don't give them the topics a priori, you know. So the two person could come up with very different one is very interesting i in Yeah. Right. Yeah. So I I think I think it's yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But eve ev even someone would would provide very different labels, like like someone would say it's a page in English, someone would say it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a web page uh wh which has very few uh information in it or anything. So I think there's no hard clustering, and what's good with those model is that they they can they they are intended to provide you some some kind of way to compare two documents rather than to give you pre-defined sets of documents. This is not hard clustering. The o I I don't think one one one aspect or one latent topic has any sense by his own. It's when you have the word set and the word distribution that you c you can tell something. If you just take one of them alone, so you take all the P_ of Z_ given D_ and all of the P_ of W_ given giv given Z_, you you you can do anything with that. It's it's the whole set. I would say an an and this is oh it it should be evaluated, meaning that like for example uh the the example about marbles is that the point what you can learn from all these sets made by people is that is that those two those two marble would be consider as more likely to be in the same sets, because they they share some common properties which are not seen as the same for every one. But they share some common properties that people will notice. And if you look at the two the d all possible pairs of marble, you would have some mu much more agreement between people than than if you look at the predefined sets people would would just cut at some precise uh point. You know what's Yeah. Yeah. Well you don't you don't really have two clustering no no no no, you don't you don't really have two clustering. No no no no, you don't have two clustering of of of marbles. What you have is y is you have is you have one clustering of marble, which is this one, and then you have lots of people telling you I consider those marbles as very uh have to have very salient feature that they share in common, I I c I would like them to be in the same cluster. And you c and and and those two, so and one of them is labelled, and the other is not labelled. So you look at that, you say oh, someone told this one was very similar, and this one is said to be blue for example, I dunno if it's the label. So I put it in the blue bag. But but you don't you never use the blue bag, you don't ask the people to look at the blue bag. You just look at the people you you just have the people to compare those two marbles. And then it happens that some of them have been clustered. And and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, this is I reverse both role. The this is the players. I i no no no no no. It comes up with not with the clustering but with some way to compare two marbles, okay. Some would say would say I consider those two ones are completely dissimilar, and the other ones say they are very similar. And if you find that in your unl unlabelled clustering those two uh balls uh marbles happen to be in the same uh cluster, you said the user algorithm might be wrong. But you average that over lots of documents. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They make sense only so global optimisation, the likelihood is optimisable globally over the whole aspects, etcetera. So it's it's you never ask the model to do hard clustering of documents, you just uh ask uh it to find a distribution over aspects such that a document uh is more likely according to the restriction that the number aspe aspect is limited. And and so it the it just makes sense on the uh looking at the whole set. So y I think all evaluation should take that into account and look at the whole aspect set. Like here you look at the aspect set because you look at the similarity of two distribution. An any st any kind of thing you where you un unfold the model and look at it manually, looks weird, like like in those Hoffmann papers where show you columns with words or things. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But also it depends on that could be a good effect. Because if you if you can be if you can if you are uh highly reliable about one page, but all the page linking to it are actually about very different topics, so you could say maybe I was wrong from deciding only due to the text that this page was about this aspect distribution, because because all the other pages are voting in different direction. While there's a balance Hmm. Yeah. Pedro's always speaks about cars. But I think for any kind of way you have to select those alpha you you have to look at the effect on on the re on the t evaluation task. And then maybe you can find some patterns that are then then once you have the once you have the task, you could look at at which pages are completely missed by one model, which others are are successful with one model, and and you can maybe infer some some rules afterwards. But if you have no task, you can uh blindly select s good alphas. Like like if if you look at uh if you look at your task and you see that, I dunno uh, the the long pages for example have good P_L_S_A_ model without fusing links, so then you can infer some heuristics like okay, the alpha should be proportional to the lengths or anything like that, or to the number of image in the pages, or anything. But you should have some some task where you can individually look at the performance on every on every page. And and and and at as a second step you could infer some kind of rule about how to select alphas with respect to the task. Maybe it's v it's very simple rules, but select them blindly s might be odd. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But but but still li like the the the work I did on on hyperlinks, like I used uh Wikipedia, i I think it's g because it has fairly high level of inside links between Yeah. Well you can categorise them because they are th it's there's a structure on the on the web page. So you you can select only the links which are within the article or within the categories or it's it's it's well-structured, it's it's uh easy to manipulate and Yeah. You can even isolate the directory from the categories of Wikipedia. Well yeah, actually I I I divided in three equal size parts which have one hundred fifty documents. There are a thousand documents. And well, but Well, what I did with the link well, but this is not th exactly the same setup you would have. So in this setup, the whole link structure could be known, and the only thing you wou don't you w don't know would be the assignation to uh to a category. In my setup it was different, because I I sh I couldn't use the links between different sets. But this is not I don't want to mess you up with that, it's not the same kind of experiment. But you could just use the whole corpus like this, and and for some of them you assume you don't know the the category assignment. And then you can run this set of experiments over Wikipedia. Yeah. But this is the yeah, this is the hypothesis between this uh in this P_L_S_A_ with link stuff. Oh yeah, I thi Yeah. But you can you can think also at at other uh task like that. Like for example you can take proceedings and assume the categories are the keywords of the of the d of the documents, and then if you have the archive of a journal, you can you can use the l the links between uh the citation links. So if you want to have a bigger stuff so Wikipedia would be kind of very small with lots of Engli in links, and then if you take a journal you will have less links and and more documents. And then you would be likely to say that P_L_S_A_ might be better over that, because you don't have enough links. So you you you can find examples which are not the web I think it's good to work in closed set. Wikipedia is kind of closed set, ma even if there's lots of outside links, but there's lots of inside links. You have to think at at at at at at at database where there's lot of in links. Wikipedia might be one, citation, for example if if you take the NIPS arch archive, which is available. NIPS author always other NIPS author, which are often themselves, etcetera. Well, it's reported, I I won't say. So but but but but yeah, I think th th this kind of setup maybe web pages it's hard to find, sets of web pages which have good links stuff if you start from one page or something. Okay. But it's discrete uh no, the Okay. Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay, yeah, thanks. Okay, yeah. Well there are lots of good ideas that are recorded and someone will Yeah. Because the data like will be released very soon.
So is it correct or no? Hmm? Yeah. Well, so we hope. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh, this is is frozen frozen okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah,. Perplexity, uh. Yeah. Oh, no re no I don't even remember the the you said I would tell you that evaluation should be done based on likelihood or perplexity. Well it's bu yeah, it's basically the same, but I dunno. Yeah, another task or Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No no no, i no no no no, it's doesn't have to be that if if you use the latent representations or distribution over aspects, you could use this to save two documents uh in the same directory or not. And this you should be able to evaluate then. Um Yeah. Clearly wha we we had done these. You can train after that uh an S_V_M_, saying this is category one or two on the label document, and then we will have an unlabelled document and you just say this is directory one or two. And if it should improve it, if you say this feature extraction process is better than you can have a better cleaner separation between those two. Yeah, well but Yeah, well, but I mean if you have to judge it's with respect to a given task, I mean you can't say of course it's always good, because it's maximising the likelihood of whatever. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, it's the same. Mm-hmm. Fus. Mm-hmm. Yeah. 'Cause I don't think there is any way to say generally this this is better or worse. Yeah. It has to be re it has to be really to with respect to this, this clustering makes sense or I dunno. Yeah. You can e even keep the bag of words and do the cosine comparison or Just showing just showing how just first how better this is with respect to bag of words and hopefully then how you new uh regularised P_L_Z_ given D_ is. I dunno just uh yeah it's basic. Mm-hmm. But Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, just know where. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. No, it does Yeah. It doesn't have to match. Yeah. But yeah, it just re Mm-hmm. Yeah. Because the the latent aspects really doesn't have to match the final uh directory category. It can be anything but it's just a way of saying yeah, those documen documents are similar in some sense. So Is it just it just sometime dangerous to say th these latent aspects means this. Yeah, I think yeah. Good, good good. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and the others usually don't mean anything, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. For your model, mm, good. Nerd. Nerd. Mm. Yeah, cars and web. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Which ones, uh? No, no. Hmm. Okay. Well in in three months. Oh yeah, it's too late, three months. We should wait.
Oops. Mm-hmm. The rapple also. No. Okay. Mm-hmm. With the link here in. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Of the value, yeah, mm-hmm. Mm of the previous r uh page rank or of the Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Mm. Okay. Mm uh-huh. So wait uh, I don't get it. You you have two representation, one which comes from this link uh stuff, and one f this one is not based on P_L_S_A_ too? Yeah. Okay. Y A T_, yeah, uh okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay, okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Ah uh okay. Yeah yeah, it's okay. Mm mm mm. Yeah. Or they use the perplexity on the the likelihood to say oh good, this likelihood is uh is it's smaller than the other. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh it's the same. I it's making the assumption that uh this human categorisation is related to the one that is discovered uh mm. Mm. Oh, yeah. No, but But I have the feeling i in But in this case you you have to use uh the label one, yeah. Your los But how does it enter in that? I i you have to train your uh Your training data. Yeah, but the point is that you should change in a way that to take the label into account, or not? Okay. Okay, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-mm. No, but w But i No. The the there is not uh v uh perfect uh clustering clus wh what is the how do you judge uh what is a good clustering? And you're not exactly compar uh. You're comparing them Ah, okay okay. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Also like a baseline, yeah. You m you still not combi No no, but it's another Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-mm. In fact I I have seen a paper in I_C_M_L_ where the guy was trying to learn which word he um aspects of clustering, so I give you I give the real users mm the person um a bunch of marbles and they begin to say okay, and they have to divide it in five group, and in the end it's not al it's it's always different to the clustering each people has, because it's completely subjective. But in but there is uh some characteristic that are for transparency, colour, which are um features that made the clustering, that can be extracted even if the clustering it's always different. So so that's only to say that uh it's it can be really infinitive clustering. Mm-hmm. Say another another example apart from uh this uh search. Uh I don't get it exactly. What you mean, then don't don't use a Google page because it's uh too uh s root, but uh another page mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Oh, it's not that People being your algorithm? That's the point? Mm. It's getting Mm-hmm, exactly. We're not trying to to fit yeah. Mm. You had onl two topics? Or no? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It was linki, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So it was a a good point for you. Mm mm-hmm mm. Like this, yeah, mm mm mm, okay. Mm-hmm. mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm, probably not, yeah. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm. Yeah mm. And Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, w w I think we've agree on that, yeah. Mm-mm. Mm. Mm probably heuristic it will be easier to compute because Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, yeah, mm. Mm. Mm. Did you manage to to divide the link uh properly or Okay. Mm-hmm. L_D_A_. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm pyramid, yeah. Ah, okay. Yeah. Mm-mm. 'Kay. Mm-mm. In two months, yeah.
You never know whether you've got these things on right or not. You never know whether they're on right or not. Feels wrong. Okay, so I don't need that. Okay. So David came in to me and to say uh i something we'd been talking about for a while was some stuff I'd been working on about using these topic models with uh with networks, with n things with links between them, documents that are linked. Uh n uh it's actually it's related to rapple, but it's not actually that th this is something I haven't actually been working on for a couple of months now, uh just because I came up with something more interesting that I've been working on, but uh th at the time basically I'd been trying to use P_L_S_A_ and those types of models on web pages, and that came up with uh a big problem in that most web pages have very very little text on them. But you can tell what they're about based on the other texts on the site, the texts on the things they're linked to, so what I wanted to know was can you combine the topic models that the pages, that have lots of text on them, with something else that that tells you what a page that has no or very little text on it based on the links, yeah. So quite simply if you have a page one which is like a home page, and that'll maybe have five links and a picture on it, and then because it links to page two and page three. Can you tell what this is about? Yeah, so I started looking at uh Google page rank, which kinda does this by saying well, the links go the other way, it says if this page is about fish or in Google, they say if this page is good in some way, and it links to this other page, and we don't know what this is, then that page is more likely to be good. And it's just page rank is just a simple algorithm for doing this over the whole big network. So I wanted to combine the topic models that tell you beforehand what you think this page and this page are about with this to maybe get a better idea. So the idea is say you've got some text on a page, that's only part of the picture about what of what the page is really about, and the links pointing to that page are also part of the picture. So I basically came up with an algorithm that's just a i it plugs P_L_S_A_ uh plugs page rank into P_L_S_A_, right, so page rank you basically just d uh say You basically take the how good this page is, which is X_, and how good this page is, which is Y_, and you then say this page is based on uh how do you do this? Based on the the links coming into it, uh it's just a like a sum over all the the links of uh well, X_ link I guess. O of of the value. Uh uh the but it's not it's Yeah. If if so if this is page rank of X_, page rank of Y_. I think this is roughly it off hand. Page rank of Z_. So you say page rank of Z_ is equal to uh one over a constant to normalise it. Uh sum over all the links into Z_ of page rank of the link. Yeah, tha it's like that, yeah? So similar idea. If you got a vector that says what the topics are, say you've learned from P_L_S_A_ a d a distribution of topics for every page, so if you say a probability of topic one for uh for page uh Z_ uh is equal to, and you can use the same sort of thing. Right, so nicking a whole bunch of maths from how you work out page rank, uh it comes up with uh just uh an iterative algorithm, which is just uh the current probability of topic one given Z_, so that's probability old plus uh i yeah, plus that and then you normalise between them, so you say alpha and one minus alpha. Yeah. So w basically what you're saying here, one minus alpha say link contribution you can call this I guess. So what you're saying is that a page is partly from its text that you've got on the page, and it's partly from what the links say it's about. So that alpha thing is how much do you trust the text on the page, and how much do you trust the links. So that alpha could be different for every page. So what I did then was try this on a big database of web pages. Uh and I had some results from that, but they were all on temp two, so that's not important right now. Uh but as it is not really important, I can regenerate that. The problem was that this gives you a new vector of topics for every page. So you've got two vectors, you've got the one that you've just got from P_L_S_A_ or whatever model, and you've got the one that you get from this. Uh how do you tell which one's better? I had no way to evaluate this well. How do you tell that this page because you don't know where the topics are, 'cause they're learned automatically, uh so It it is, yeah, because uh b yeah, you initialise it with uh actually thi this is kinda wrong, this is not old, but start this is how you this is how you you start it off. So this this is what P_L_S_A_ gives you to start with, and then you iterate this and it becomes something else. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's it, exactly, yeah. Exactly, yeah, so you've now got you've got P_L_S_A_ gives you two probabilities, right? So it gives you a probability of a topic given a document, which is Z_ given D_ and a probability of a word given a topic. So this is the same for both models. Yeah? Well yeah, what you do is you're taking this and iterating over it, the probability of the topic given the document. Uh so have I made that clear, I'm I'm not sure if I'm explaining this well. Okay. Right, so y i you m Yeah, so we were struggling at how do you evaluate this, because uh I mean if you look at the way that P_L_S_A_ and all those kind of models have been evaluated, it's th they never quantitative quantitatively do anything, they always say uh well, look at the clustering, there's here we've got some documents that all appear to be about the same thing, and here's where we get some other documents that all appear to be about the same thing, and you can't really tell exactly how good that is, you can just get an idea that it's Yeah, so tha that's the first thing th that thing when I spoke to you about this, you suggested d use the likelihood and Pedro came up with a really good example why that could be bad. So you have uh you have the uh oh, let me thing of what this was. It was to do with cars basically, if you have you have a topic that's uh representing cars, and you can tell that that's representing cars by looking at this distribution, and it's the same for both. Now you wanna tell which i i this page, uh Pedro's example of what it was, is that is says on the page Lotus Elise. Okay? And that uh no f I can't I just remember it was a really can you ig remember what it was? No, okay. Yeah, I didn't really consider doing it on perplexity, actually, that to be hon but okay. Okay. Is that fair though, because I think one of the things with these topic models is that you don't know you can't make them cluster Okay. Hmm. Yeah. Okay. And that is is that really fair though? Can you say that if a set of documents if the clustering of these documents is closer to the effecti what you what you've got there is uh a clustering of documents a as your devaluation, yeah? Uh thi this these labels, the Yahoo categories, that's that's a clustering. So you're by saying that this clustering is closer to that clustering is is does that necessarily mean that it's better? Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-kay. Mm. We uh I think your point was that you you train this without labelling first, yeah? Mm. Mm-hmm. Well th yeah, the the thing that worries me about this approach is that say the really really really simple example of this where your directory had two categories in it, uh good and bad, and and and you run P_L_S_A_ on it, now that doesn't do it good and bad, it does, I dunno, English and French pages, so they don't match, but the clustering is still very good in in one respect. Uh but but you you can extend that up, even if you have a hundred categories, P_L_S_A_ can find a hundred clusters that are a good clustering, but are completely unrelated to the directory. Hmm. But but what I wanna know i is that which of them has the better representation of a given page. So so given a random page, uh and these two models, uh and the wo the words that these two models give, which is more likely to Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. S okay. I'm I'm just n concerned that that's uh that that's it's answering a question that evaluates in some way, but maybe not in the way that Well that maybe not is the same way I was thinking, but maybe it's a better way um so what I mean by that is that sorry, I'm trying to process all this. Uh Yeah, i it's the same thing, like it it does tell you whether this uh which clustering is better for this task, but it doesn't tell you which clustering better represents the pages necessarily. But it it's it you you could say that it possibly doe it probably does. Okay. Mm. Yeah i Mm. Okay. Mm. I think mm. Uh no, I th I'm I'm coming round to it actually. No, I'm so I I I think I g uh I I get it. Uh I I th I think it probably is fair, I'm just I I've gotten um uncomfortable with it, but I think that'll go if I think about it enough. Uh but but yeah, the it it but it just seems a little suspect, but I think that's just from the whole point that you can't tell which clustering is b better. But uh what I'd thought before was could you get people to evaluate this by by hand basically, could you give people a set of pages and like say you did it with five topics for example. Uh now you give people five sheets uh you give uh a t a a user five sheets of paper, each with words in varying sizes representing the probability of that topic for example. Try give the user these pieces of paper to get an idea of what these topics are, that's this P_ of W_ given Z_. And then you give them some pages, and say which one would you which piece of paper would you put that with, and then you get like an intuitive ide uh like how would a person cluster pages given the what these topics supposedly are. 'Cause i you've got something that's fixed, the the P_ of W_ given Z_ with respect to both models. So I was tr I was hoping you could use that to Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Hmm. Okay. See, the the thing about web pages I thought as well in that getting humans to evaluate it in some way is that you have most of the web pages that are uh well a lot of the web pages that are important in some way are are are home pages, so Google dot com doesn't actually say the words search on it, I think. I maybe it says go, but you only know it's about search through the thing, but someone looking at it can tell that it's a search engine, because of the way it's laid out, because of the pictures on it and because of all of that. There's a lot of information that's completely lost in this bag of words representation, and I was hoping that in some way you could use that to evaluate this. I have no idea how, but uh yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Okay, I think I know it. But it yeah, thi this is effectively what we have here though, and th that directory is one clustering of the marbles. And you're hoping that it it so what you're saying is that I have two clusterings of marbles for my two models, and I have a test clustering of marbles. It's saying that one of these is more close to the test t t to the the one that we've been given, is that it's saying that what does that actually say? That doesn't uh it says it's g better for this task, but it doesn't really say anything else. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh and so and so if I get that right, what what the algorithms are still coming up with is in this way you're looking at a clustering of marbles, yeah? If each of the algorithms comes up with a defin Ah okay, right, that makes sense. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm convinced, I'm convinced, alright. So it's good. Right. Uh alright, well thanks. Um I'm trying to think of anything I haven't said about the stuff, but that uh from looking at the results I got it looked quite good, um just like hand reading them in that one of the things I did was I started a i a web crawl at the IDIAP homepage. It did not very many pages, only like two thousand or something like that, but enough to get the pages that were close to IDIAP to have a lot of links between them. So that there was enough to be able to run this link clustering algorithm. So what you find is that the pages around IDIAP, there's a lot of English pa speaking pages and a lot of French speaking pages, so of course this uh P_L_S_A_ completely separated those out into into categories. Uh so when I looked at the the word likelihoods, there were two topics. One was very clearly English words that most likely word was the, and one was very clearly French words most likely words was de I think and uh No, I had many topics. The others looked like garbage, couldn't tell what they might have been. But anyway, uh tha that's often the case, when you look at it you can tell very clearly that one or two topics are a b not the rest, yeah. It is. Ok Hmm. That w uh anyway, that when I run it on that, uh what I found was, looking through some of the sites uh I looked for the sites that the models differed on, that where one said it was probably an English phrase and the other said it was probably a french phrase, and I found a good few examples where you had a site that looked uh well one that I remember off hand was it was a page and it was a big picture, and links down the site, but the links were all pictures. So you couldn't the the words were in French and the links, but there were no words picked up by the when I did the crawl for the model. And there was a small bit down here, and in this there was uh meant to be picture in there, but it didn't load uh or uh b it was meant to be something else, and it said uh in English it said four O_ four this page cannot be found. So all the words on this page were English, but it was very very clearly a French page. So the first model said it was an English page 'cause all the words were in English, second model said very definitely a French page because all of these pointed to French sites and it was only pointed to it was something dot F_R_ as well, it's Yeah. So I I found a couple of examples that were kinda like that. Mm but the the problem that I found when I ran it, uh the th the thing that was a bad point was that if you have uh say tryin I was trying to say if you could evaluate this with search given some keywords like which model would more likely find you a p good document, that that sort of approach. Uh what I found was that say you had uh Uh th tha that's not too relevant necessarily, but if you have say a topic distribution for uh one page, and it very very highly scores on the P_L_S_A_ for one of the the topics, and that's right, okay, this model, because it's averaging out over all the pages nearby, all of the topic distributions become more flat. It it becomes more uncertain about everything. So I don't know if that's necessarily a good thing or not, yeah. In in some cases it's gonna be a bad thing, b because ev every page is linked by the way the algorithm works, every page is linked eventually to everything else, so it every page has information incorporated in it. Or i the distribution learned for every page has information incorporated in it, from every other page's distribution as well, so it averages out, it flattens all the distributions, depending on what this alpha is. Mm-hmm. Well I I think that the thing is Yeah, that that there's a balance in the uh for example take a page like uh Slashdot, and it's like a news site uh for geeks, and you have uh nerds, yeah. News for nerds, stuff that matters. Uh all of the like hundreds of thousands of pages point to that, but they're about completely different things, so you in effect are losing information about what that page is about, because there's so many things pointing to it and they all average out as Yeah, so that Th that's my first idea w was how I set this I remember for the Lotus thing wasn't there? Um so I thought you wanna probably set this alpha per page, there's probably some heuristics, for example this page, there's no text in it, will set it very low in user information for the links. Problem is, this is what Pedro immediately said, what if you have a page that looks like this? It's got a big picture of a car uh Anyway, and it says Lotus Elise, so you know that it's definitely about car, but it's only got two words. So you can't just do it by words, because those two words completely specify into something or other. Uh su you suggested doing likelihood, but at that time and I can't remember what my problem was with that. It might not have been a good thing, but you've got two likelihoods for it as well. No, maybe not. Mm. Yeah, maybe do it by cross-validation, something. Okay, there's Mm. Hmm. Yeah, that that is fair. Yeah, okay. It yeah, d No. Yeah, i so uh I I think that that's too easy. You can do it with some heuristics and you can learn it from the task results in or combine the two, so tha that's kinda straightforward, I think. Yeah, the the the thing about doing it through cross-validation or something like that with the task is uh the problem with doing a page rank style algorithm is that is that it gets better it it converges better and it gives you better results, the closer a network is to being a small world network. So small world network mean basically some far links, but generally very clustered locally. Uh now the thing about doing a web crawl is, the bigger your web crawl, the closer it'll be to the overall structure of the net n the internet, which is a small world network. The smaller your web crawl, the less small world network like it's gonna be. So the more pages you get, the better your results. And people running this style of algorithm, the page rank style stuff, generally run it on about two million or twenty million pages, or whatever. The the Stanford web base data set that I was using for this, for for a bit of this um, they have a a d I can't remember off hand, but they have m maybe a bit over a theta byte worth of web pages in this, a bunch of servers. Uh Yeah, maybe Wikipedia is a good thing to do. Was I was concerned about Wikipedia though was that it's while it has a high level of inside links that has a lot of directory style links as well that might mess up it actually being a see wh while you have Ah okay, that's good. That plus I guess it's actually straightforward to say to start with is this a small world network and then run it on that. You were running that on what we what was it, like half a million pages, something like that? Is it and that was for half of it? Uh if I remember. Okay. Okay, the whole thing was Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. I mean I think off hand thinking about this model it would have to work better, because two things in the same category are going to be linked. So it it yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's I think tha it's gonna be more true in some networks and in some tasks than others, and I think in the Wikipedia it's probably gonna be it's a good one to test on. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, it I'll maybe I'll have a look at the Wikipedia stuff anyway. I'm stuck doing something else for the next month or two anyway, so. Uh this is always the case. Uh the there's another thing, um uh this was new but I haven't thought about this too much, but it's on the same lines in that uh have have you guys seen this uh correlated topic models work? Correlated topic models. It's David Blei, the guy that came up with uh with L_D_A_. He's got uh a new model that's it's published in NIPS this year, but his co-author put it on their web site a month or two ago. So uh you know L_D_A_? D you all know L_D_A_ or yeah. Uh okay. So a L_D_A_ you basically draw a a Dirichlet which says like what type of document this is effectively, and then you draw a topic given that Dirichlet distribution and then you draw words given that. Alright, well that's for for every word and that's once for the document and that's you've got a parameter coming at this globally. So that that's roughly what the model is, plus other little bits. But anyway, so what they did was they they reworked this because one of the problems with L_D_A_, and I think P_L_S_A_ has this problem as well in is that uh the more topics you have, the less uh expressive it can be, because the topics it cluster it it pushes a document if it is pulling a document into one topic, it pushes another topic away from that. Doesn't that make sense? So the topics are necessarily trying to be different from each other. So the more topics you have, the more th they're sort of squeezing into the space of what things can be about uh and things are kinda pushed out, so once you m go over you try it one corpus, and once you go over about a hundred, maybe two hundred topics, uh the the new you add more topics and it doesn't get better in any way, the model doesn't. The n new topics are effectively going to just be garbage. Uh, alright, so what they did was they they they stopped using the Dirichlet and uh they're starting to use uh a Gaussian there. So it it in to spare the details basically, they've they've got a variable here, I think they call it eta uh and they from this generate a distribution of topics in some way, but it's generated from a Gaussian space, from a from a a space, so it's given a a mean and covariance uh and Yeah, uh so what it does, the this is the the bit that took me forever to understand actually, uh same model, but this is given a Gaussian space it maps that down into the simplex of what a topic can be about. The so the simplex basically if you've got a say you've got two topics. Now say i i say you get three topics, that makes more easier to draw. Uh for this is theta one theta two theta three, these are the probabilities that that a document is about uh this theta one is the probability that this document is about topic one. Theta two is so these guys all have to add up to one, yeah? Uh so that basically means that what a document is about lies on this space between them, yeah. So this is the simplex. Uh so basically a distribution generated by this guy is basically a point on this simplex. So what they do is they've got a distribution that maps uh a Gaussian and some space into a distribution on this thing, so it maps it into Gaussian in that. The cool thing about that is that if you've got two Gaussians, you can tell how close they are. So you can now tell how close two topic distributions are, right? So you can have as many as you like, uh and you can tell that they're close to each other, so there's load of ideas that I had about this uh in that if you can tell that two topic distributions are close to each other. So for example if you split a document into two parts and said that the two parts have to be close in the distribution, you can see how the doc t the document changes, for exa stu stuff based on that. With this idea, what if rather than working with this P_ of Z_ given D_ thing that you had from P_L_S_A_, but what if you worked from these Gaussians that you get for every document and you said that in some some function that said uh that the Gaussian representing this should be similar to the ones linking to it. Now I haven't thought about any of the maths for this, but but it should be uh straightforward I guess to to formulate a basic in terms of the mean should be similar and the covariance maybe should be similar as well. So it might actually be a better model again. I dunno. I'll send you guys the link for that correlated topic model stuff if you want, but uh I don't know if it's too interesting to you. Okay. Alright, well than thanks for hearing me out and the idea especially. Maybe I can do more with this. Alright. Yeah,. Yeah, b Bastien, you can't release this data for four months.",IN1005
"I mean if you're ever, you know, late 'cause of that, it's not we'll find a way around it. And I've put you guys on Mondays at this time for my convenience, but it's not like it's important that Really? I really? Great. I was th so what'd they have to do, back up? Ah. Nasty. Yeah, yeah. Go i we're glad they'll look after that bit. Uh I don't know. Do we wanna look at anything? It's not up yet. I can Oh I don't know what it's doing. Oops, that fell off. Doesn't like silk. Stay. And now we're gonna discover we've got no reason to meet, right. 'Cause everything's going swimmingly. Oh. 'Cause uh I haven't been I haven't read the Wikis in my email since I left. So um Oh yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Um the oh, well um I don't know the Mozilla stuff. So if it turns out that it's idiosyncratic in some way that teaches you funny habits, then it won't have been a good idea. So Yeah, yeah. Uh well y th there are certain companies um that I don't wanna name who don't always get it right. I c but m yeah, Mozilla. Yeah, it'll be alright. So okay. I believe you now, it's a good strategy. Mm-hmm. Uh wh why does it help that it's X_T_ H_T_M_L_ instead of just X_M_L_? Yeah, but most m most browsers, when when you uh put an X_M_L_ file up in it, it'll just apply some default style sheet to it anyway that shows you Okay, yeah. Okay, so all you're gonna have to do is swap in tag names later. Okay. Ev everybody's got their different ways of doing these things. I'm sure that's fine. Like having to uh g it's Yeah. No, I'm just try I'm trying to l think of the things that could go wrong. Um but since I haven't tried it this particular way, you know, um but yeah, that sounds good. So um i so you say we haven't finalised what the G_D_F_ looks like. Is that an implicit request for me to do something? Or Uh-huh. Yeah. As a well, I mean there's two two cases in here, right. There's things you can get straight off the original format, and then there's things you have to do some kind of post-processing of the original format. But it's not just a data format change, it's actually some kind of computational process to get the thing out of it as well, right? And it wasn't uh y I think it was a little bit um confused uh last time we spoke about um whether U whether you consider G_D_F_ format to be um the thing that's just the straight-forward translations of what's in the original eye-tracking output, or whether like whether the post-processing utilities are a separate step. 'Cause I think you and I had separate different views on this, but I can't remember w who had which view at this point. So y are you working uh actively on this anal these analysis things or you just working on the translation? Uh so the data format translation. Oh okay. So you haven't looked at what's in there and what isn't in there that you need to do some really intensive transform to do. Not yet, oh okay. Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay. So this sounds like it's under control and you're happy and you guys are telling each other what you guys need to know. So I don't need to do anything, right. You're all fine. But there was a number of things that came before this, right, that it sounds like they're not under control yet. So so you know, the G_D_F_ stuff with so i Ellen's view on this is we go through everything in order. Like the priority is exactly the pipe-line order, right? So um Camtasia you mentioned. And I'm not sure what else, but we should check what other things were before this on the list of things to do. Until you get the oh, microphones. Batteries. Okay, uh are they really really strange batteries? Have you tried Maplin? Are they expensive? 'Cause you know, like a wee bus journey over to Maplin might solve the problem if it's getting in the way. So this isn't actually um ruining your schedule for anything, and that's why you're waiting. Right, okay. It is i so it sounds like you're not actually worried about the fact that this is the m yeah. When you get worried, go to Maplin, okay. Phone them first to make sure that they're in there. Somebody around must have a uh probably Steve. Somebody in the techie group will have a Maplin catalogue. Fact, I'll see if I can um yeah, it's useful to know who's got a current one anyway. I don't seem to get them anymore. I guess I don't buy enough equipment. Oh yeah. Of course. Duh. So you can find out whether they have it. But you'd have to phone over to find out if they have it in stock down there. I actually live not that far from there. Um so it would be a half hour um diversion from my morning routine to pick up stuff. Uh w but then again, it's also very close to Haymarket, so it's even less of a diversion for you, probably. Except you don't know your way around. Ah yeah. Oh yeah, c yeah. Yeah. I just think well, you know, for the sake of three quid or however many quid it how many batteries does this thing take? Doesn't take a hundred. Yeah, then, you know, put your mind at rest. 'Cause, you know, you wouldn't want it to be the morning you were supposed to be recording and then suddenly discover yeah. You know this. Uh check they got 'em first though. Their stocks are a bit funny down there. 'Cause you know, it's not that attractive an area to walk through if you're not gonna get anything out of it. So of all the things that were on the Wiki do I need to pull up the Wiki? Ah, it is gonna let me log in. No, I do not wanna change my password. Um But you guys probably know off the top of your head, is there anything else that we we we were waiting on before you could run? So all those tasks Craig had when it started. Uh his last day was the thirty first of October. Uh yeah, no no. It's ours. Yeah, it's ours. Oh, so he's got ours left.He's behind-hand. But no, he was billing for he was billing by the hour. So I thought well, I mean obviously if he wants to finish off then you know. I b Oh well they're probably away then. Wasn't Ellen away? They're really at the same place. Oh, yeah it could be it. Oh, you have no models at all. Oh, that's a pity. Model buil builder, that's what I was calling the graphical model editor, right? So you use X_ fig to make the parts and then you this thing. Oh okay. Yep. Okay. Um I have something in my email about from Joe. Uh he wouldn't have sent it just to me, would he? Do you want me to check that? I'm not gonna project my email. Okay, I think I mighta heard Thursday or something. I can't remember exactly when it was. Uh Okay, so I've got something on the twenty eighth. That's Friday I think. Oh, he just wants to know how to get paid. Right. That suggests he's done done done. Anyway, he's in Edinburgh. So well I suppose he won't come by 'cause Craig's on his desk. Yeah. So Well, he's just not gonna try to le squat there, that's all. Uh well I so the last thing I've got from him about work work was the nineteenth of October that said he uploaded some changes that you wanted. That's Oh, so you didn't get that. It was me and him. But presumably the he put it on the Wiki. So So he's just telling us 'cause he things we probably don't read Wikis. And I'll just check. Yeah. Well I I haven't replied to him about yeah, I really don't have anything more more recent from him. S I haven't replied to him about um you know, how to submit costs and stuff like that. So um but that suggests he's at at the end of things, but w we could just ask him. I mean maybe you guys would just wanna ask him directly you're done done, right? 'Cause um it's worth you guys knowing. And then of course any problems that remain you inherit. Uh right, you know, it's worth taking a look at what it does and making sure it does what you want, I guess. So th the problem is you want you wanted to construct some models in it for your experiment but you were hoping to get some from Marloes. Ah yeah, yeah. Right, have you you tried cold-calling her? That's what I do when I need things that Ach, try phone. When i if you get 'em today, when are you gonna start running? Oh right. So you have to be you have to be ready by then. Yeah, or re change the schedule. Right, okay. Uh-huh, yeah. Makes sense. Um subjects, you're gonna have d Yeah. So s y y you don't have subjects lined up, but you don't expect any trouble getting them. Mm-hmm. Yeah. By? Um I don't know this person. So they well, they need to be serious about it. Who who's their is that a staff member or a student? Okay. Um well, we kinda paid for the lab. So it depends, but I suppose talking to them sometimes solves these problems. Um you might it depends on what sort of staff member is it? Is it a Right. Um I mean presumably he or she is not running subjects the entire Block book for how long? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Um so uh um Ellen's still out of town, right? It's just uh y you could try calling this person and see how this works. Ellen might be more persuasive. Um it's just sometimes uh academic staff have a bit of a chip about um research staff. And since I don't know the person, I can't tell whether it's one of those or not. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and then escalate, I guess. But uh, you know, or whether they can be put off for a little bit or something. So I have no idea how the booking system works. Well, you're discussing it on Thursday, right? At the moment, there's just a booking system. Yeah. Yep. Well that's that's one to raise at the meeting. Um I v might talk to Ellen about that ahead of time 'cause uh they may have she and Martin may have had discussions about appropriate use of the lab. Oh really? Yeah, but I g don't you guys set up for isn't block-booking more appropriate? Because I i isn't there set-up involved in changing around for somebody else? No? Or in the software or anything? Okay. So there's no cost associated with it being mornings or afternoons. Yeah. S so in the worst case um you may be able to make an argument if you actually need that week that you can collect in the mornings that week. Is this something that's known outside Ellen's head? It's on the w booking system. Oh well. That's something. Uh-huh. Well, most the time to to p yeah. So it sounds like you've got a lot of possible ways of getting what time you need. Of course try to be kind to other people. But you would anyway. So So those are the only things that are worrying you, Camtasia and lab access. And otherwise no sweat, you're happy. Oh and the model builders, yeah. Oh yeah. H uh-huh. These this is gonna take a little while. Mm-hmm. Yeah, but you were gonna try and figure out how to overlay something on top of the video that or no, you were just g really gonna run a video of the sep of the trial. Yeah, okay. That's that's much easier. So um with the model-builder, what do you need to do with it? Th the um which one you is gonna look at what it does so far and you'll just t try out do that. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Um how many models were you relying on her for? So are you suddenly gonna be Well, what I'm trying to get at is is your start time gonna be delayed 'cause you don't have the models ready if she doesn't come through? Uh-huh. Yeah. Well Um can you draft Craig in to build some if necessary? Yeah. Well you know me contingency planning and all this. I always worry about the worst. You can um call a JAST telcon between you and Marloes. You know, i if it's not that see, you know, with the cold calling you can usually at least find out whether they're alive and get an an offer to to get something. But, you know, the next the next escalation is saying no we really need to talk about this. We're gonna talk about it, you know, Tuesday, at such such a time unless you um But presumably whatever it is they've been going through is now over. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I d I'd just hate for that to c um to slow you up in collecting stuff, that's all. Obvious yeah, uh okay, that's true. Well that sounds That's quite a small thing she can do for you, I guess. You know. It's not like, you know, w sitting there brain deadly constructing, you know, some models that she needs to do. It's just to provide advice about this, which must take take less time. Well, that all sounds fine. You guys worried about it? You worried about anything? We've mostly been talking about the experiment schedule. So. Mm. You're gonna run out of things to um f do that we haven't set you up for any time soon. The G_D_F_ sounds like it might take a wee while. Yeah, but you don't need anything from me for that, 'cause that's already sorta speced. I mean again that's the pair of you. Yeah. It's just what I'm worrying it w worried about is him being in the lab all day long and you not being sure like what to do for the analysis on or something. 'Cause you're gonna be completely unavailable when you're recording? Or will there be times when you don't record all day. Uh-huh. Yeah. 'Cause he might oh yeah, no no no, I understand that. It was it was more like oh, it was more like, you know, you so this week he's got, you know, the G_D_F_ stuff to do. Then next week you're planning on recording. And what happens if suddenly you're unavailable all of next week just when he runs out of work? Yeah. So so we'll worry about it then. Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah. What I do don't know is we wanna bother with a part builder. I mean the idea was it wasn't worth the investment, right? Yeah yeah yeah. Or Do y M yeah, but now now that the guy building these models know that they need to do the rotsym some stuff, do they have do you have trouble doing it? No, so Yeah. Well g I mean um we might want to um severely cash limit the investment that you put into making a part builder, right? So how how many person days would it be worth, like if Craig discovered it could be done in X_ days Right, so there's your limit. Don't spend more than a day or two on it. Yeah uh 'cause it really isn't worth it. You you have to understand there's things about this project we've hidden from you so far that you'll have to learn about. So it's it's not like you're out of work. Oh really? Oh, that one'll just be a little add-on. That'll whatever it is, it'll be the same skills as you've learned for something else. Um and it'll just be I'm not even sure that's you 'cause I think somebody else is doing that actually. But um I'm thinking more of the fact that um at some point we should probably tell you about this N_X_T_ stuff. So Oh, yeah yeah yeah. But you know, there's X_M_L_ and X_M_L_ and, you know. It takes stand-off links and stuff and it's um some some people if they're not used to linguistic annotation c um uh it c take a little time to get their head around the way the do data data model works. And um, you know, there's stuff to learn there. So Yeah, yeah. Yep. So Yeah. So just don't witter away, you know, weeks on fripperies when we've got the real me meat of this yet to come. We'll find we'll find plenty of really really crucial s things for you to do. So Okay. So uh I'll uh remind myself to look at what's next before the next time we get together. Yeah. So you collect on Monday? That means you don't wanna meet, right? Oh, r right, it's actually next week. It's actually the week that you were planning on. Oh okay. Well, I don't know. Anyway um you'll tell me whether it we cancel this. Or whether I just talk to Craig. In which case we won't be up here 'cause we don't record twos. Oh yeah. That should be fun. Let's see, that's like the That comes at an ideal time for you then. That's like the twentieth or something. Uh I can't add. Monday is the Yeah. Oh yeah, you have to promise to tell us how that is. 'Cause people do ask me. Yeah, on a scale of one to seven. Yeah. Yeah, you'd be surpri these things do Well, if they were gonna do that then they'd force you to go to it. I would and I would know somebody who'd gone to know. You know. I'm pretty sure they didn't have induction in my day. So Really? But you only started here They were supposed to, I'm sure. Oh well. Oh yeah. Uh Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Seems reasonable. So um it'll be like in uh monitor. But yeah, they'll all be different tiers like that. And then there's the language stuff as well presumably. Yeah, this is the easy stuff. Yeah. Well, eyes and mouse. Eyes and mice. Uh-huh. And that's enough for you, right? I mean that's just the way you want it. Course there are lot lots of things that can do that. But it's the language part that's the hard part. Yeah. Yeah, that's That seems fine, yeah. Do you know what the um the sets of codes are? Well the whatev whatever whatever you're getting out of the JAST analyser. So I mean blinks as well, right? Oh so you don't want a pa uh part of this data? Aye. But I think you I think you should well, there's two views on this. Um if you do then the people formulating research questions will ask about them. But if you don't they'll probably ask about them anyway and then you'll have to add 'em after the fact. Uh so it's probably easier just to s shove 'em in. You can stick 'em in a different um track and uh and then load 'em or not load 'em as you please. 'Cause it's not well, I don't know. With is it is it part of so th these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets of codes against time, right? Isn't blink a part of this? Yeah. But but isn't that important? Because when they're blinking, basically it's like an a nil code. You c can't find out what they're doing otherwise. So it may actually be important to have the blinks registered in there because you may discover you need to take them into account to smooth some kind of analysis that you're doing. So it could be that if they only they hadn't had a blink just then, they would've been I don't know what. I'm thinking more That you wanna know about. Oh, I hope n not to much relies on missing stuff 'cause people blink. I was thinking more like um, you know, the person looks a p a part and they've got a uh fixation before and after and there's blink in the middle. And, you know, there may be times when you wanna treat that as one thing, right. Oh right. Okay. So but in that case Right, uh-huh. In that case then um these tiers are already like blink corrected. And then you wouldn't have blinks as part of this. You'd want blinks as a separate tier if you're gonna have it in. Yeah. Yeah, so the key thing is he here is mutually exclusive and exhaustive. And um the second key thing is um it better be really clear to the people who are dealing with these codes um uh w yeah, whether any monkey business has been done around the blinks to correct for that. Um 'cause, you know, it wouldn't necessarily be obvious looking at that set of codes that Uh yeah, I suppose if you know about eye trackers then you'll just know. But It I think you're just saying it comes out of the eye tracker already, right? They're already blink-corrected. Yeah. Yeah. But what we need to know is like at what stage in the eye tracking stuff where it does that and whether that gets through so that um Craig gets it automatically in what he's translating or to G_D_F_. Whether he needs to redo the same analysis because something about the data path cuts off that analysis for the eye tracker. Or whether we even like it, right, and wanna do it some different way. Yeah. But it could be these things are corrected for blinks in this way plus there's blink information. So, you know, it it treats it as a fixation around blinks and it also just happens to tell you where the blinks are. 'Cause as they were saying, they like to use blink rate as measures of cognitive difficulty or something. So If they're not still fixating on it when they come back out of the blink, then why is that is that the right thing to do analytically? Oh right. Yeah, you said that. Well, but does um the duration of fixations count for anything? 'Cause it if you're just adding the length of the blink to the fixation, you're not treating it as a saccade. Okay. Wait. Okay. I kinda get this. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. So more complicated than I thought. I'd forgotten about the multiple fixations on an object. Yeah. Okay. Well, it's not okay, I mean this is kinda what we were talking about before, this confusion about what's in the G_D_F_. I mean you might see it as the initial G_D_F_ is just whatever straight-forwardly translates without, you know, without transforms, with just the data format changing from the ASCII. And then there's a bunch of other things that get added that you might still want to be in um augmented G_D_F_ format, you know, like this blink and the gaze and whatever else. And then you translate to N_X_T_. So you might still wanna have everything in this one G_D_F_ file format that represents everything. And then the N_X_T_ thing is just a splitter. It's not doing any fancy analysis. So I see this as, you know, a bunch of little routines that take the the G_D_F_ without this information in it and add new information into th sub-script versions of the G_D_F_ file that contains these post-process analyses. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it to some extent it doesn't matter which data format it's in, N_X_T_ or G_D_F_. But it makes more sense for the converter between G_D_F_ and N_X_T_ not to add any data. All it does is do this this stupid data format conversion. And it it's just, you know, separating it out in the little steps. So, you know, there have to be these other scripts that add any um data transforms um not data format transform forms, but data transforms. Like this idea of um of putting together gazes from fixations. So y you know, i if we keep it simpler like that so that it's in little pieces, then it'll be just easier to understand w what the wh the whole thing does. 'Cause you you c you know, i if suddenly you discover there's a problem with the G_D_F_ to N_X_T_ transform, you wanna know whether it's one of these little post-processes going wrong or whether it's just the thing that dumps it into the multiple files for the and G_D_F_ to N_X_T_ transform is c is pretty simple. So um, you know Oh yeah. So that's like all the analysis that you need to do to things. Are you just gonna copy what they do? Or Is it documented like why they did it they way they did it? Or is it just Well it's good starting point, right. So it'd be interesting to see if you agree with the decisions that they made about how to do things. Mm. Ah. Well b but we don't wanna build it into our data path. We just wanna learn from it, I think, right? Correct? Or no? Yeah. I'm just thinking, you know, like i so this takes the ASCII to to a d simplified ASCII. And simplified in with transforms in it ASCII and it's just it seems to be harder to maintain something that's got that in it if it'd be better to break things up into like steps. That you know, as part of the the and als Well why do I think this? I don't know, because it's somebody else's programme and then they're gonna give us the next version and that's gonna break our entire pipeline. You know. That's the main reason. Yeah. Uh yeah, I can imagine I can imagine that also requiring some discussion about whether what they do is what we actually wanna do. That should be interesting. Uh Uh-huh. Well, sounds good. Yeah. And if in doubt um don't filter stuff out, keep it in, right. 'Cause we always dump it to this other N_X_T_ track that we don't need to load necessarily. So um the idea is you just keep stuff unless Mm-hmm. Oh yeah, and it's easy enough to dump stuff into an into separate track. W we gotta teach you about this at some point though. So um but still not quite sure when. It sounds like maybe in another week. So Jonathan made me promise not to um tell you about it when you first arrived 'cause you were gonna get overload about learning eye trackers and No. It's just too many things at once and it wasn't important that it be then. Yeah. So Yeah. He's a cool customer. He's ready for it. Okay. I think we're done, right. Sorry? Oh yeah, I don't know. I do not really need to this just says look at the Wiki. Find out what's next. You could give give Craig more work to do. This one's mine. It Oh yeah, well that'll take forever. That's that's really fun. Check your batteries.
Yeah, it says Is it sliding past? Yes. Still fifty six percent completed. Skip it. 'Cause I'm just doing a b yeah, disk check or something. Yep. Is everything going smooth? Hmm. Mm. As long as it comes out in the end. That's Mm. Uh nope, don't think so. Um Mm-hmm. Uh it's batteries we're waiting for. The they're they're due uh i I was told the beginning of this week. Um th they are quite strange. Mm uh uh it's w uh r um a Avril has ordered them from somewhere possibly. N no. They're probably one fifty each or something like that. Uh well hopefully. The they should've been here last week. But uh Caroline then phoned up to chase them and they they were s they were told to be here. Should be today. Uh r b well we can still test whether Camtasia runs anyway. It's just the uh whether it's the microphones are picking up things correctly that we need to check. Not yet, no. Right. Mm right-o. Virtual. Yep. Uh right. But what we're I I Mm-hmm. It no, it's two batteries we need. Uh no no. No. Yes. Fair fair enough if you want. Mm-hmm. It's still probably even that angle. Can't remember the Wiki. D um The only thing that well the thing that's holding s me slightly up is um checking whether Joe's f finished that there i there is a working um model builder. But I'm not sure if it's the finished finished version yet. And the the ninth Yeah, he still had n hours left. I wasn't sure uh if it was down to the number of hours or whether thirty first of October f uh certainly uh uh he right. I think he's had something like seven. But uh n I've n ni Nijmegen has gone dead for all those last two weeks. Well uh it w e e Ellen's away. N no, um but I think what they had was some big review. Uh a and so I haven't heard anything back from them. So uh the models for Yes, uh-huh. Well no. Well we don't need to um make the the parts are all the standard tangram ones I had before anyway. The X_ fig thing's only when we come to building airplanes and new peculiar shapes. Uh but for this experiment it's just the tangram type uh task. Um yeah, if you got right. How r f how recently that nothing I haven't i heard anything from Joe for a a week or so anyway. So Yeah. That's that's newer than the It's the last thing was in sp response to the thing I was saying last week about the parallelogram being the wrong way around and uh w from the model builder to the actual yeah. Um that nothing has I haven't heard anything since from either sort of the Netherlands or from you. Yep. Oh, is he back? Oh is he? Oh no, right okay. Yeah, it was after it was after that that uh there was the thing about um w w why the parallelogram was the was a mirror image. Mm-hmm.. Yes. Yes, or at l least um she was meant to have have some idea of the level of complexity. 'Cause they d they d have actually run things and to uh get an idea of the sort of style and to check that they'd be alright. But all very quiet. Yeah. Uh no, it has just been email rather than uh f f the telephone type of uh request. But I'm down for a week. What's the seventh is a w a week today, I think. Next week. Um well uh I haven't booked anybody in or anything. But uh that's when I'm hoping. We have been of course put back a bit by the eye tracker going down. But uh we're we're needing we're certainly needing some data in the bag by the first of December, I think No. Um hopefully not. The only other slight complication is um which will be b I think brought up at the meeting on Thursday for all the eye tracking users. Um uh the lab has been block-booked again. Jules from um Psychology. Have di Yep. Lecturer. Well presumably not. But uh it's sort of quite solidly booked uh for f certainly w what six days from ten till five for two or three of those days. Um I wouldn't I no I can probably at least email her and ask her uh if she's really needing it all that time. I i well yeah, at the m yep. When people just uh if they can log on to it can book it. Mm-hmm. Uh i th in theory JAST is meant to have it every morning. Um but it uh there shouldn't be any changes in the physical connections or or anything. No. Uh no. that as long as p other people don't for some reason, I don't know, disconnect some bits of the equipment, there's no reason why they should. It's just the Uh yes, it's um it's on the p uh it's not on the booking system. It's on a web page that Frank created about the lab. Which I don't know if anybody actually knows is there. Mm-hmm. Yep. Should should be. I've also got to get Camtasia we well, yes the m the model builder. I've got to get Camtasia working um as a sort of little multi-media thing to generate a video of how to mi sort of a an instructional video. It's what I'll have to do this week. Hmm. U Yep, yeah. Uh I'll I'll do that. Yeah, and just yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Have a look at uh um hopef hopefully there's not a p a problem. But uh they said Marloes was uh also meant to be checking it and doing things and quiet. Um I've I uh it hasn't been divided up in that sort of way. But Um depends how quickly I manage to get a grip of it, how long it takes me to generate them or how I get on with the Camtasia. Mm-hmm. Un unsure of yet. It it shouldn't the there shouldn't be any great uh problems. Just checking that the they're of a suitable level of complexity or or of whatever. Yeah. Yeah. No quite quite right. Yeah. So yeah. Um yeah. well I was hoping for some feedback from yeah. Yeah, exactly.. Yes. Yep, mm book a time and I think so. Right. Well, I'll try and get ahold of her again today and see what I think it it was up till the end of October. So presumably today they're now free again. Or taking a week off to recover. Yes. Um well hopefully it it won't anyway. It's just if I then do it I hopefully will get the right models. That's that's the pro so uh uh it will be generated. It's whether the models are optimal or not that I think that's right. Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well so it was the whole all the dynamic region part of it that's uh Mm-hmm. Uh n um no. Uh well it depends how how many I can book in and get get running. Yeah. And before my brain melts it But w when when the experiment's running, yeah, it's I'll be in the lab. Uh I can't just go in, let them get start and then come back. It's uh so some people can, but Uh th they'll certainly be time because I'm right next to the lab anyway, I'll come back just to check my email and things anyway, so uh yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh I wouldn't bother more than one or two certainly. Mm-hmm. W Mm-hmm. I don't think you'll be twiddling your thumbs, no. Um well at twelve o'clock next Monday the lab is technically booked by Jules. It Uh it starts the uh on we this Wednesday and goes through to next Wednesday. Mm-hmm. Um what else? Uh Yeah. My then other complication is two weeks tomorrow I start my teaching Mm-hmm. For I've got two weeks of that, fo four lectures and four labs. Yes. Uh what's tomorrow, is the f tomorrow the f first? So it will be the fifteenth for two weeks. Oh you've got your uh induction, that's right. Uh yes. From a total waste of time to, you know. Mm-hmm. It's probably the university'll cover itself legally, I think, by doing this. Uh mm-hmm. Uh no I suppose rather than being Nobody's bothered so far, is it. Uh well I don't remember being asked for an induction. So In April. I got invited to a um a a a summer garden party for new staff members. But that was but that's all. Hmm. Uh-uh. I have one N_X_T_ question which hopefully won't be well, it's not one. Just hopefully as part of the output it will be something like that. Is that correct? So you've got the gaze position of the first person, gaze position of the second, mouse position of the first, mouse position of the second and, I don't know, a common mouse action there or something. Does that t just in in sort of layers like that. Yeah. Yep. Yes, uh-huh. M that's that's just the the eye movement uh other sort of stuff, yeah. It ho hopefu uh hopefully that's yeah, I guess it's that's why I dre As well. Yeah, mm-hmm. Yeah. So I was just yeah, I was just checking that uh I know the language part because they say L_P_ here but uh this would be the the the new part. New stuff. Uh yeah, whatever that is. Um yes, I'm not sure whether we need to know exactly where they are, just how many there are in each tra um uh p I don't know. I suppose it could go in. Uh I mean I suppose it we're as well to have it if we can. Right. Well uh just say stick 'em in anyway. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um blink would uh uh at the moment just get lumped in with the sort of previous gaze. Mm-hmm. The way they're looking, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. M uh yes, mm-hmm. Moving somewhere else, or is more likely to be uh blinking at the same time as the other person was doing something, I think to mm-hmm. Yeah. Yes. Norman normally uh would be just, as I say, like add the blink time and duration to the previous fixation. 'Cause you're not absorbing any new information and that's what the critical sort of deciding factor is. Yes, so that they'll include the So i i yeah, would ha it would be as a separate tier where just to mark the actual position. Mm-hmm. What's included and what's n yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. No, not certainly l not looking at codes, no. Mm-hmm. Know what to look for and what not to, yeah. Uh i there are well they're already identified as blinks. Then it's uh i it is at th hmm at what stage. The software that I've used uh p pools uh the blinks, so will add it on. I'm not sure what the default Yes. Yeah, so I'm not su i certainly it's listed as a separate event in the stream. Blinks are a tag uh from the E_D_F_ and and that sort of thing. It's registered as a a detection. But Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh i y yeah. Uh I mean it it it won't because of the fixation it will be down to what we define as uh a gaze. So basically the time from when somebody starts looking at an object until they leave it. And so if they blinked a lot within that they're still looking at that object. So it's just the time in to the time out. Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Some other way. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yep, there's a blink sort of event. Mm-hmm. Yep. It should just be a matter of treating a b adding on the blink to the last fixation or something anyway. Uh well uh the the real reason is um as long as they've been blinking, even if they then open their eyes somewhere else, that's when they start absorbing the new information. It's basically like a just a long saccade. Mm it you kind of have visual suppression when you move and it's the same when you're blinking. You're not taking anything in. So Uh it it's yeah, that yes, um that's for the sort of gaze time measure. Uh it's not actually the fixations are still um independent. So the they w fixation duration isn't doesn't include the blink in the ASCII a output. It's only when we start looking at sort of the total gaze that um the total amount of time spent looking at one particular object, which includes all these sort of multiple fixations and any blinks and that sort of thing. Is it it's a a sort of composite uh viewing time. Uh yeah, I'm afraid uh mm-hmm. Yep, yep. Although we'll also still need a count of the fixations just so we can have you you've got measure fixation duration again just to s see if those they spend longer just f amount of more stable move uh eye fixation or not. Uh Mm-hmm. Yep. To ye yeah, mm-hmm. Viewing times. Mm-hmm. Right, yeah. Mm-hmm. Well that's partly why I brought this up now is it I'm not sure what point down the data path things sort of happen. But that's what I want out in the end. Um well the N_X_T_ stuff will have the more complete picture 'cause it will include combine all the linguistic stuff with all the movements and the actions. Um but there'll be I suppose just some purely eye movement stuff we could do. I s presumably with G_D_F_. Uh Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. C An And uh yeah, that's also why I sent you the mm Saarbruecken software f that uh the stuff that takes the ASCII sort of format originally and then just uh sort of compresses it and things. Yeah, the German stuff. Uh because that little utility um does things like t well but you can tell it to what to do with blinks, whether just to lump them in or or not. Uh what the minimum fixation duration for a stable fixation would be, sort of you have if it picks up t fixations less than say fifty milliseconds, you can tell it just to again lump them all together, that's not a sort of reliable enough fixation. Uh you can put in these sort of of things. So that's uh that's a bit of software that's sent and that includes the source code and things as well. Mm-hmm. Uh no, there's very little documentation as you might imagine for these sort of things. Yeah, so I g I uh yeah. That's that's why. So Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Fine. Good. Mm-hmm. 'Cause uh al also just filters it. There are a lot of um strange event tags that the eye link produces that are fairly meaningless, I think. And it can stri it strips out a lot of the junk uh as well. So it cleans it up. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Right. Uh b fine. Well um possibly. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. The pr Uh yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah, I see what you mean, uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Six or Mm-hmm. It's it's not quite s it so it's not gonna be quite grabbable 'cause it is it's written in Java. Yeah, well yes, uh-huh, the actual uh Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's always better than making too much compression to start with and then being out of unable to go back or yeah. Lossiness. Or or you leave very quickly. Uh-huh. Yep. Well I'm I am. Oh dear. Uh my page is blank still. I guess not.

Yeah. Yeah. Well uh I was expecting to get, yeah, though and I did did make it in time. But it just just 'cause all the leaves and things. Um the stra the trains weren't stopping at the stations. So they decided to put speed restrictions on Yep. Yeah. 'Cause apar apar apparently p uh I'm not sure. Um the and they're bussing people into station have particular problems on it 'cause it's on a 'cause it's on a hill or something. Um so I had so I had to bus people in from like stations either side. Yes, yes. But yeah, at l at least it was speed restrictions instead of like trains flying past into barriers and things. So Oh, f yeah... Okay. Well, you know, apa pa apart from apart all apart from waiting for the get get Camtasia sorted out. Yeah, I haven't I haven't added anything to the Wiki recently. So uh 'Cause I've we've been been working on trying to get the X_M_L_ stuff working. So some the ba basically they only had to how the DOM works, um so I can do the next so I can ge generate D_D_F_ files. Huh? Um so so th yeah, so just just been reading through documentation, that's what I was doing the end of last week um just so I know how it all works and figuring out the best way to do things. Um but I'm at the moment I've I've been playing with the DOM stuff in Mozilla. Uh 'cause I 'cause uh ju just so at least I can see how it works with the H_T_M_L_ pages so I can generate um the X_ so I can generate X_H_T_M_L_ stuff and see how it all works there. Just 'cause to just see how things work in that um and It well, thing is that the A_ the A_ well the A_P_I_ is standardized by the W_ three C_. So the A_P_I_ is stan is standard between everything. Um Uh or Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is. It it just has a couple of yeah, yeah. Um well yeah but if they will b but it doe does look like it does does that this is and things like that. So I was doing the is anyway. Um it's ju it's just that that's that's quite a quick way to just to get into how how works. Because I can just quickly generate quickly generate a web page and then just add and take yeah, add things to and take things away and don't see exactly what's going on at the time. So Oh well just 'cause X_H_T_M_L_ has a nice you know, you got browsers there, so you can actually see you can actually see directly what's what's going on. Yeah, well I'll I'm using X_H_T_M_L_ uh to deter that's uh all all the web pages are X_H_T_M_L_. So it's X_M_L_ just with the H_T_M_L_ D_T_D_. Yeah. Ju ju ju just ba just 'cause we haven't uh we haven't f haven't quite finalised the um the G_D_F_ format. So just just well just Yeah, yeah. So all have to do is just change it change that sort of thing so it's uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but Um that what what what what I'm doing the moment I'm looking through the s the uh stuff that Robin put on the Wiki to say what's, you know, what what we need in the in the t um in the output format for the for the task, you know. So what what you're what you're gonna do the analysis on. Um so I'm making sure that I can take get that information out of the G_D_F_ as it st state of the moment. And if I find something that you can't get out of it then I can add that to the add that to the G_D_F_ format. So Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well the Well I'm I'm I'm ju try I'm making sure that the G_D_F_ format we've got at the moment will d will output say well I've output old analysis that that Robin's looking for. Um so so I'm using that as a way to to get into ha ha using the DOM things as well. Um so yeah. So at the moment I'm looking at act actually the G_D_F_ format itself um and then to generate the G_D_F_ format I'm gonna be taking stuff out of the gest analyser um and then using a DOM parser to generate uh X_M_L_ output from the gest analyser. Uh no. No. But uh I'll when and out of the output of the gest analyser does does do some of the processing already, which is what I'll m plan to use that as the basis for it. 'Cause that already that already picks up like target regions, things like that. So you get so so it knows whether you're looking at a part or whether you're looking at target area or what or whatever. Um so yes, as long as it got that in it somewhere. So it's just a matter of pulling that out and put that into the um into the G_D_F_ stuff. Yep. Yeah, um bu Yeah, yeah. I um I think the o the only thing I've got left to do before the experiments can be run is get s is get the check Camtasia works. Um now I've got Camtasia running on machines and I think they're set up correctly. But I can't test it until we get the microphones working. Microphones. 'Cause Ah. Well he must some these days anyway, isn't it. So so Yeah. So we all got off easy. Yeah. Ah well ca I can easy I can easy get to mapl uh to Maplin I know where it is off I used to live there. So I know I know where I used to live here. I'm a geek. I know where I know where Maplin is. Yeah. Well I suppose I could gi I could give you a call on the way in tomorrow and if th not bi it's not been in your in your f um pigeon hole, I can easy go off the train and early and just pick 'em up from there. Right, yeah. Well I'll make sure I make a I'll make sure of I got the f the phone number in my phone so I can call them. All true. True. Um uh it's Dalry road, isn't it. Um Yep. I t I'd say you don't be. Mm. Yeah, yeah. screen shots. Yeah, yeah. Oh. Hmm. Well I'm I'm using DICE machines. If he wants to pop in for five minutes, the the Windows machine is free for him at the moment. Yeah. Yeah I mean I considering we get an email from uh the I think it got sent through saying that he'd updated the the whatever it was on the Wiki. So you do he'd he'd uploaded a ne a new zip file and overwritten the old one. So Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well when the whole thing was if it was gonna run a trial that'll give you some some screen shots to work with. And then it'll just be a matter of adding new video f mouse movements or whatever. So Uh have a look. If you th anything prob any problems with it um think there's a Wiki page up for that f for that piece of uh for yeah, for that thing. So if if you just put just put whatever recommendations, bugs on that page and I'll work through them read 'em as and when I can. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Um Yeah. And like these yeah, I mean I've used the software and there's not that hard I mean. Uh Yeah. If Yeah. So well I can't imagine the building the building the mold is gonna be that hard. I mean I can easily just well however many thousands are on that uh Dutch web site you found. Just, you know, pick pick some of them, redo them in in the Ja in the J_C_D_ format. That's yeah. It's pretty mechanical. I can easily d easily do that. So but it's a matter of choosing which ones you need to do. Which I guess you have to do. Well yeah. Yeah well you need to you you and Marloes need to sort out, yeah. Um I don't think don't think so. I mean uh so the the major thing I've gotta d got to do is get this Camtasia sorted out. So just waiting for the batteries for that. Um if Robin's not worried I'm not worried. Um Um p Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'll go gotta finalise that format and then once that's done, I've gotta start looking at the analysis side of it. And that's Yeah. Um Yeah, yeah. I think yeah. No, the the analysis I think the analysis will take a little while. I don't think it's gonna take that long to get its stuff sorted out. It's gonna be how to display it and all that sort of stuff. Uh whatever makes it easiest for you to do. Um but once w Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Um yeah, so I still gotta work on the gest analyzer and turn that into the t into a G_D_F_ outputter. Um and uh oh yeah, and I'll I can have a look at the model builder as well. Um 'cause one thing I'm thinking about is w we're looking at the the part building pa type stuff. Uh and it might worth seeing if we can add a little part builder thing into the um model builder. Um just just the ju I just gotta tidy tidy up some the code for generating the parts anyway, the J_C_T_ um parts from from S_V_G_s. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But I'll wanna have a qui have a quick look and see see how easy it is to add this things to it. 'Cause um if if I can use it to generate um um the rotsym angle for example and the rotation symmetry stuff for it, which is what was causing the bugs uh before. Um so if I if I can use the model builder to automatically do that then that would sa that would save quite a bit of work and it'll d save a few bugs. So No. It's uh it's just something you gotta remember once the part's been built. So um Yeah, yeah. Well I'm not not not pl not planning do much on that. It's just Yeah. I mean I've I've already I've already got this yeah. Yeah, other I saw saw saw saw something about map task like little further down my task list. Right. Right. Yeah, well that that's that's just X_M_L_ to X_M_L_ to X_M_L_, isn't it. Turning G_D_F_ and what other bits into N_X_T_. Yeah, yeah. Right, right. Um yeah 'cause that's the yeah, o other than you have from what I've heard about it is both X_M_L_. So the the programming side of it doesn't sound too hard. It's gonna be making sure that it fits what you expect out of the format. So um but no that's that's fine, I'll d I'll have try to find I'll I'll have plen plenty of uh plenty of questions for you once I once I get to the last stage, I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we'll Yeah. Well the we're gonna get Camtasia sorted out this week and then it's concentrate on the on the gest analyzer, the G_D_F_ stuff. Um and then yeah, once once we've done that it's whatever whatever you whate whatever you whatever you want me do once I done the once I've done the G_D_F_, I guess. Yep. Yeah, so I think the G_D_F_ will keep me busy for a little while yet. So um yeah, well that's yeah, certainly keep me busy until this time next week when we can start suggesting things that might might need to look at for the next stage, I guess. Yep. Okay. Yeah. For the first, yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Actually yeah, that reminds me, I wo wo I wo I won't be uh on Thursday I'm gonna be over in my induction day. So so Fair enough, fair enough. I mean uh I don't it's meant to be that in depth. It's Yes, yes. I mean I d I don't expect to be that in depth. I mean it's fifteen minutes on a variety of different topics. So it's just it's uh it is. Uh yes it is. I'm sure most of it I already know. It's like fire safety. Yeah. Health, safety, data protection. Usual sort of stuff you get everywhere. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, I mean I can remo Yeah, I can remember when I start being a st when I was sta starting being a student. I mean ha we had the inductions were compulsory because um a lot of students were doing te were doing teaching. And you couldn't do the teaching unless you done the induction because you had to know about health and safety and fire safety before you could take a charge of yeah. 'Cause you were the responsible person in the in the class room. So So But uh yeah, I'm not sure I'm not sure why the why why I'm doing it now. But okay.. so see how it go. I'll I'll uh give you my report on Friday or something. Yeah. Huh. Okay. So so that mean you need the blink corrections part of the analysis then. Um Right. So tha tha that's uh that's for the rest of the stuff that comes the eye tracker, isn't the analyzer software that comes the eye tracker. Right. Right, okay. Well i i if if you want if you want the blinks mer merged into a fixation, it might worth making making a cr part of the requirement for the G_D_F_ stuff. So to remind me so to to just add that analysis to, yeah, to to it. So it's I mean it's easy enough to do, just che just checking the times th times of the events. Right. Okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah 'cause I think the ASCII format as it stands does contain blink information um 'cause uh d d I'm sure I'm sure that's appeared in the in the documentation I've read through. Possibly. Possibly, yeah. Right. Okay, okay. Um yeah, so might might worth us us having a look at that and just just seeing what dat is what data is already in the ASCII format and whether you want me to do any correction as part of the analysis. Um 'cause I've gotta do the analysis for the fixations on parts and things anyway. So yeah, I d I I I didn't think check for blinks during that. Isn't gonna be a shouldn't be a big problem. Yeah. Yep. Um so we'll be Right, mm-hmm. And so are you looking for a final thing that just sort says between this time and this time you're looking at this object. Between this time this time you're not looking anything. And Yeah, yeah. 'Cause I think I think at the moment the G_D_F_ format has fixations in it. Um so so I gue I guess that'd be part of the G_D_F_ to transformation would be turning fixations into gazes and whatever else. Okay, okay. Well tha tha don't don't uh worry about that just the moment. But Right. Right. So so so w will you actually be doing much of the G_D_F_? Or is are you expecting do most the analysis on out of the N_X_T_ stuff then? So whe when you uh when you actually generate your results. Mm-hmm. Right. Yeah. Uh yeah. C well yeah, you told that earlier 'cause you could do a quick ana you could do a quick analysis on the G_D_F_ stuff without having to before you hit before you do the dialogue analysis type stuff. So you can get some some results anyway, can't you. Okay. Yeah. Right. Okay, okay. Right. Oh yeah yeah. The Germans don't yeah, yeah, yeah. Fair enough, fair en Yeah, so so they they we're allowed to do whatever without without source code. There's no c sort of restrictions on that. Fair enough, fair enough. Yeah, I suppose I can easy look through and start writing up some documentation on it. That'll gi that'll give us a starting point for us to sort to talk about it to look for what analysis we n actually need to do on it and things. Um yeah, easy. C yeah, create all the uh switches and whatever else you need to do. So um Okay. Okay. Yeah. So we'll on once yeah. Well once I've had once I've had a bit of bit more look at this G_D_F_ stuff, then start looking through that. Start looking through that and make sure that works. 'Cause Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I've l yeah I've no no noticed that the the the gest analyser knows quite a few things as well. So um but as Yeah. Well uh I use it that useful for generating this G_D_F_ stuff, I can easily incorporate whatever functions it takes from into gest analyser when I'm do doing the G_D_F_ stuff. So Yeah, yeah. I mean but what, yeah, say what what I'll what I'll plan to do with it then is take the is take to the software, find out what functions are useful for us in that, and then use those functions to generate the stuff that goes into the X_M_L_ file, the the G_F_ format. Yeah, yeah. So so the fir fir first part that'll be documenting what they've got and then discussing it with Robin. So uh yeah. So so I suppose pose that that way the Right. But yeah, well I tr mo mostly, yeah. I'm sure I sure most the logic's gonna be gonna be the same. So um Right. Yeah, fair enough. Yeah, fair enough. Well so so it's so long as it's X_M_L_, N_X_T_ will handle it, won't it. 'Cause Yep. Fair enough. Okay, okay. Yeah. Well I'm well I'm well g I've got the hang of all the stuff I've been going through. And it looks like l looks like I'm coming to end of the stuff the stuff list there already. So I'm gonna have start looking at that as the next stage. So Yep.. Well, I ma I ma I may be maybe I want to check out these batteries and things, won't I? So tomorrow. Well, that'll be something to do. well well will the will the will will do if the trains are tha as bad as today. So",EN2009c
"So we only get one printer for fifteen people? The three person room? Mm. Yeah, I w I would suggest that too. Yeah. Okay, so th that's a one person room, but we don't know how how big they are. Or it's hard to tell. I mean, Gisella has this funny uh typing uh thing. Yeah. Computer, fax. So probably sh she should get the fax, right? 'Kay uh will it be dedicated for reading and for studying or can we have meetings there. Can reserve it for meetings. Well, the the problem is if you have to go across the building and it adds some overhead every time you want to have some short meeting and discuss some issues. Or maybe we shouldn't call it reading room, but So people would like to see uh the office organised by uh by by rank like professors and students and Yeah, that's a good idea, yeah. Yeah. Everybody agrees on that, yep? How about how about this room? Yeah, at the bottom in the middle. With a view to the mountains, yeah. It has three windows so I think it's uh Two? O one two The the middle one. Two. Oh, the big Oh. Ah okay. Me too. Yeah, and you can look outside of the window if you have a sh quick meeting there. You know, quick meetings always get longer. I don't know. I was thinking of maybe we should assign Gisella into this three person office? Because w we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes. Then we could have Gisella and the two fifty per cent people sharing the three person room. Well, th They're fifty per cent, yeah. Well, I mean it W yeah we could. We could. I mean, I don't know how noisy she is. It's uh Convenient for her, yeah. Okay. It's fine with me. Yeah, it's it's not the m Yeah, yeah. Y Okay, we should write this down. Do we agree that the that the photocopier and the networked printer goes next to the mailboxes? Yeah. What with I mean she is sharing an office right now and I Has anybody heard of any complaints that she's too loud or Okay. Yeah that's true. She needs spaces. Okay. Okay, so Gisella at this southwest office? Yeah, yeah, that that one, yeah. Oh right, yeah, that's southeast, yeah it's Yeah, this office, yeah. Uh yeah, I was just talking about uh here on the map. The three people room or You get lots of sun during summer, yes. Plus spare, yeah. We got For fourteen people? Yeah. So we are good. Alphabetically. Is is any Is there anybody who's not happy with the current situation, so we could try to just keep the same arrangement just on the new building? Okay. So, let's start then top to bottom: Maggie, Susan,. So how long is?
Mm-hmm. Alright. We can put it. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. 'Kay sure. Yeah That's a good idea. Ad administrator. Yeah, that would be maybe convenient. With someone Yeah, and with someone who is who is fifty pro percent. Yeah, okay, mm-hmm. Typing machine. Yes, yeah. Or uh yeah, professor assistent or uh Or uh yeah Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Mm mm. But still I find it's quite easy if you are with people who work in the same project in the same room, because you have the meetings or people come and ask you discuss things maybe. I don't know if it's uh for other people who is not working on the same project. Yeah, that's true. That's that's true. Yeah. You can u mm-hmm. Meeting about the project. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. People coming and going. Yeah, we don't. Yep, yeah. Mm. Yeah, it certainly is. Plus the com Mm-hmm. Yeah, but if there are people coming in, I mean, we have these people working for uh two months, who comes in the summertime or something. I th think we should reserve a little bit space for them too. So uh It's quite big Mm. For soemthing, yeah, mm. Yeah, that's yeah, certainly is. Maybe that would be good. On the sixth floor, I don't know. Yeah, if you are if you are reading. Do so Yeah. Why not? Yeah. A library down downstairs. Mm. In the middle, yeah. Oh it's g good enough. And uh Gisella? We thought a one person room. Person room. Or f Yes, yes, she does. And the place where we all pass kind of. It should be some central place. Yeah, that's a good idea. I it Yeah. So for example now if uh we reserve Yeah, yeah. But we can uh reserve So if you reserve a two people room, we can put uh trainees Further on if they are in the same room. In the corner. South. Southeast, yeah. That's southeast. North. When do we have sun? But s Well, there is a quite a lot of sun. Y yes and no. It's, yeah, it's really warm, that's Yeah yeah, that's true. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay, good, p so And next. So we have reserved now two two person rooms. Mm-hmm. For fifteen people. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Marianne, Marianne. Yeah, why not? Yeah, that would be fun. That's boring. No, we don't. Okay.
Okay. So as you guys know f, ISSCO is too small. Well, the building is too small for our group. So we're moving to a new building. Uh it's gonna be the building across the street. And we're actually moving in three weeks. But the problem is that the administration wants to know who is going to be in what office in the new building and where we're g we're gonna put things like the printer, the fax machine, all the big equipment. And the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people and equipment. And they want to know where we're gonna do all this by November second. So that means basically next Tuesday. And since we don't really have any other time we have to make these decisions today. What we're getting is nine rooms for a maximum of eighteen people, which is okay, 'cause there's only fifteen of us. And all the rooms have windows luckily, so there's no fights about who gets a window and who doesn't. Um there's two views, either of the old town or the mountains and the rooms have various sizes. There's two three people rooms, five two person rooms which are on the corners of the building, so you actually get windows on two walls, and two one person rooms. That's pretty much what the building looks like. Um and then you have the number of people per room. The courtyard, because we're on the sixth floor, you can't actually go out to it, but it just means that the windows look out onto open space. Um you can see the bathrooms, the elevators are sort of further down the hall. The purple bar at the bottom, sort of on the right is the mail-boxes. All of the windows open, you can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building. And the equipment that we have to put somewhere are like I said the photocopier, which is really big, the fax machine, which is not so big, and the printer, which is relatively big. Each office has a white board, a bulletin board and a coat rack. No cupboards like we have in the current offices, and each person gets their own chair, their own corner desk, so like the n the ones that we have now, um a small filing cabinet with three drawers, and by small I mean they're about that tall, and one sort of hanging shelf. So we don't get the bookcases like we have now, but just one shelf that's attached to the wall. And the people that we have to place, uh you can see the list there along with their position and the project that they work on. And I guess the question the first question is how we want to organise people. Whether we want to do it by rank, or by project, or I don't know, put all the P_H_D_ students together, all the professors together, that sort of thing. So the idea is that we come up with a plan. there's another group who's gonna be working on the same plan later this week. And then Andre and I have to do presentations for the university administrators on the second. So we have to come up with a plan, possibly, if we have time, a presentation, a quick presentation with arguments for why we think our plan works best. Okay? So, anyone have any ideas or I guess Yeah. Um I think it's the security is sort of the same as it is in the current building. So as long as the things are physically attached to the wall, so they can't be removed, then it should be okay to leave them in the hall. It's just a question of whether you are printing sensitive documents or n whatever. Um well we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers. I think Susan has a personal printer, Gisella has one maybe. I can't remember who else. Yeah. But no-one else gets their own printer. In terms of equipment it's sort of the same thing as we have now. Um. So what I'd propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics, and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals, as to exactly where to put people. Does that work? Oh, and on the map the little half-circular, well, quater circles are doors, which I'm assuming you've figured out, but just in case. And there's just the one room that actually has two doors going into it, the the three person room on the right. Yeah. Yes, yeah. A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room. So we should leave a space for that. And we can, because like I said maximum eighteen people in those rooms and there is only fifteen of us. And I don't know if you've noticed, but two of us are only here half the time. So Martin and David um are half the time at the E_P_F_L_ and half the time in Geneva. So sort of keep that in mind, I guess, when you are doing the actual planning. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But Gisella's really the only administrator. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And she's always moving around. No. Yeah. Which I don't know if we can assume that there isn't going to be any overlap between them. Yeah. Either that or maybe put her in a two person room with the equipment or Like with the the photocopier, or Maybe not the photocopier, but the printer. Yeah, yeah. And not with a hundred percent staff yeah a staff worker. Yeah. I mean the rooms aren't tiny if you look at the this Yeah, yeah, that makes sense to put the fax in there. Uh. So. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the third option is just completely mix everyone up, which some people say is better sort of for a group environment, so that you are not stuck only with the people who are working on your project. Right. So if you share an office with someone who's on a completely different project, you find out about that project, but you also sort of interact with other people on a more regular basis. Yeah. I think it's not a question of reserving it, because there's other rooms at the university that you can reserve for a meeting, but if it's empty, then sure you can use it for a meeting. There's nothing wrong with that. But I think if someone's already reading in there, it's not fair to go and kick them out just because you want to have a meeting 'cause But if you're having a short meeting you don't really make an appointment for it. You just kind of go to someone's office and go down for a coffee or whatever. 'Cause there's still the cafeterias that you can use for informal Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And the other Marianne too. So there's three of you. Well, but then you either share offices with each other, which doesn't really solve the problem, because chances are you are not gonna have office hours at the exact same time. So you're still going to have Like unless you get individual offices, I don't know if there's an easy way to find a solution for that. 'Cause even if each of you share with a professor, then it's the same thing for the professor. But it is something to keep in mind. Unless you end up sharing an office with someone where your schedules completely don't overlap, and then you can schedule office hours when the other person isn't there. Some people come in around eleven and some people come in around eight. No. No, but you sort of see people's patterns. I mean, even if it's not always like that, I mean if it's like that, you know, eighty per cent of the time, then But you're right, we can't make assumptions too much. I think Well, it's up to us how we do it. I can see benefits of both. But Yeah. Plus the computers. And we all know what it's like to have five computers in your office. Yeah, that's a good point, because if we take the three person room out as a reading room, then everyone has an office, right? 'Cause it's maximum eighteen. So take away three spaces and you're down to your fifteen, and you're right, if we do have a stagieur, whoever, who comes in, then we have nowhere Well, we can put them in the reading room, but that kind of defeats the purpose. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Or again find people who don't work the same hours. It doesn't completely solve the problem, but Yeah, I think so. A one person'll be too small anyways. The one on the bottom? Yeah. Two. Well, which W There's three two person rooms. That has two windows. Which is fine. And still a big room. Yeah, so I should have explained that. Yeah, but then you get don't get a lot of light for reading. Really? That's I dunno, I like the idea of looking out over lots of space. Well, I mean that that's the whole point, right. It's just somewhere to get out of your office and go and do something else for a while whether you're reading or just kind of staring off into space. Yeah, we could do that. Yeah. We have some shelves, like cabinet type shelves for the reading room. But it's not really intended to be a library. I mean, we have an I_T_ library. Um but the other idea is to take 'Cause right now we all have bookshelves. So one idea might be to take sort of the books that aren't frequently used by people, put them all into that room. So it becomes sort of a mini-library, but not like a library system library, just go and borrow your collegues' books. I think the middle one. Yeah. It's also sort of m central to the layout, so everyone sort of has more or less the same distance to It's not that it makes that much of a difference, but Why not? Uh. Yeah. Actually what I can do is Yeah. Um actually that's a good idea. J just put it up. Yeah. So. This really isn't to scale, but Oh well. Um. That's really not to scale. Um so we've got an office there. And there's two and one Is that all? Okay so this is that. And this becomes the reading room, right? Yes. Sure. Yeah. Okay. But if Gisella works fifty percent and they work fifty percent That's true. Yeah. But Just Does Gisella have her own printer? Well if you put her in in this room here, it's relatively close. True. Yeah. I don't know how much the proximity to the mailbox matters, because usually when she's here and she picks up the mail, she actually brings it to your office. It's more the I_T_ administration that uses our mailboxes. That's true. Yeah. Yeah unless you put it into an office, which is just an annoying, I think. 'Cause even if you put it into Gisella's office it's gonna be Yeah. So. Mm. At the beginning we said that we were gonna give her one of the one person rooms. Okay. Yeah. Well, she's Go ahead. Stagieurs in there. And they are not really in a position to complain. Yeah. I think it's just a question of work conditions, like if you are a stagieur and you co only coming in for two months, then you can put up with it, but if you're there, you know, for the full year Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, in there if they need to go. Yeah. Yeah. South Well, southwest if that's north. Southwest for us. No tha Well, I'm assuming that's what you meant, right? That But that's southeast anyways. This office right? That's. No, I I'm very bad at orienting where's north in Geneva, I always get it wrong. But I just assumed Nikos was talking about the orientation here. Oh, that's true. So wait, we face the old town we face the old town now, and we are facing northeast. Okay. So. This is northeast. Yeah. Mm-hmm. This one. It's the oven. Yeah, we're the top floor. Yeah. It The building design is pretty much the same as the one we have now, we're just getting more space this way, because we couldn't move in the other building, 'cause it was occupied by the other departments. Actually, why don't I change it on here as well. So that's Gisella. Plus fax. And then this is the reading room. Oops. Um. So that leaves us with what? Six, eight, fourteen places, which is For f Yeah. No for fourteen, 'cause Gisella's already got a room. Excuse me. Okay. Um. So I'm gonna take Gisella off of that list as well. I'll put her in grey, I guess. That's boring. Can we? No. We have, we have one extra one person office and Two three person offices, yeah. Plus we have the two people who aren't there now that we have to put somewhere. We can keep some of the people together that are together now, but not everyone definitely. Well, why don't we take a break and go off and think about it? And then once we have more concrete ideas we can come back and finish it, 'cause if we just sit here and discuss, it's gonna take a long time and we're gonna start arguing and get cranky and Alright so Yeah. Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay.
Mm-hmm. Uh do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the hall in terms of security stuff if we can I mean my idea is to put the photocopier and the fax in the hall. Um. Okay. Mm. Okay. Okay. Mm. Mm yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and that's it. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm okay. rooms, yeah. And do we need a room like a reading room or Yeah. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. The first split we can do is between administration and reasearch uh. I mean, it's completely different work so we can deal with administration and decide something for administration and then for the other. Yeah. But at least deal with that particular situation and then see with the other, because I was thinking uh Gisella is quite, I mean, Gile Gisella's work is quite noisy, because it's secretary so, yeah, lot of phone call and stuff like that so Yeah, so you won't share an office with Gisella unless you are fifty per cent and not the fifty per cent Gisella is working, which is another condition. Yeah mm. So I don't know, maybe we can decide that Gisella is having one of the one person room. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. But at least the thing we know that Gisella is gonna be alone. Or with equipment, but humanly alone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then I think the main discussion we should have is um if we want to make group of among the same project or among the same title or Yeah. Or Yeah. Couple of professor and assistant or That's more a conceptual question than a practical question. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but we will have this reading room, which can be Mm. Yeah, for a real meeting. Mm. Yeah. Mm. No. Yeah. Mm yeah. Mm yeah. The other thing we should take into account is if you receive student or not, because Marianne and I interact a lot with student and we have reception hours and stuff like that. So it means you get time where a lot of people come along and talk and So it's maybe Yeah, so maybe it's not really nice to have to share an office with somebody like us, having a lot of social life and Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I dunno. Yeah mm mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, but that's something we can't reasonably assume like that and make plans with that because Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I don't know. Yeah. One point I can say by experience, it's really hard to share an office with three people, because it makes much more noise that only being two in an office. Plus the computers. So Yeah. So we might be It might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room and not to be necessary a room with three people. A working room. Oh yeah. Mm. Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah yeah. So the other solution is to say, okay we use a three person room, but only with two person each time. And leave a spare space for or But avoiding having three person full-time in a same room could be a good idea, I think. Yeah. Mm. So for the reading room we will have a two person room. Okay. Yeah. Which one? With the mountain? Yeah, it's Big black stripe is the windows, not the thin one between the big But what about the d the other one which has only one windows, but in the courtyard it maybe more quiet. We have electricity so I hope. No it's a question I mean it it's quite noisy outside with the streets and Yeah, we are on the sixth floor. Yeah. And stop reading. So it's a relaxing room. Yeah, yeah, no okay. Yeah, yeah. Mm yeah yeah. Mm. So what about one of the room in the corner? So you have three windows. It's even better. But you have less wall to put shelves and stuff like that. If you intend the reading room being more a library or Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Kind of, yeah, small library. No no, no no. No no, sure but Yeah. Mm. So are we all agree about these two person rooms? Which one? Corner or not corner? The middle one. Okay. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. So we can exclude this one to make an office. Or maybe write on the board, I don't know. So we have the map and It's alright. Three, yeah. Yeah, yeah mm. So Okay. Is that a mountain? Okay. And that an old town? Yeah, should we decide also the administration stuff? And So we exclude the n the thing we are quite sure, and then we discuss the That's really noisy to be in the same office with the administration. Yeah, that just imply you expect people to come when Gisella is not working, and that's not really fair if you So we can put Gisella in the two people room which is near the mailbox. No. I don't know. I it's just the question, you always have the phone ringing, even if the af even when she's not working. Yeah. Yeah, but that's that's a good point from Nikos to say that she needs to be n near the mail box and the printer and and the photocopier and stuff like that. Yeah. Exc except the door is not really convenient. No, but I think, if if the main, um how can I put that, the mm If the main reason to put to to choose Gisella's place, is the proximity of the mailbox, it should be a two pe people room and not a three people room. Otherwise we have a one people room and Yeah. Yeah. No but it's it's also it's also the place of the photocopier. Yeah. Because if we put the photocopier near the mail box and it seems to be the only place where there is room for that Yeah. Yeah oh no. Yeah, no, it's too And it's too big and Yeah. Okay. And then we can for the moment put Gisella in this corner room if you agree, I don't know. Yeah. But this option of putting Gisella near the photocopier. I mean, she is not sharing an office. I mean sh we put some trainee in Gisella's office, because there is a spare room, and that's quite imp Yeah, that's quite uh I mean, that's quite important to keep a spare room in Gisella's office, if we need more staff, but I wouldn't work in Gisella's office. Yeah, yeah. Mm yeah. For example, and there is no room in the cupboards for any people except Gisella, because she got lots of paper archives and files and stuff like that. So it's really, she needs space. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Are you sure it's southwest? I dunno if thi if this map is a Okay, the map is north oriented. Okay. No. Okay. I don't know. Anyways yeah, but Okay. You know because with mountain mountains and old town it's not No, sorry until but Okay. No, because sunrise and sunshine is quite uh sunshine, sunrise and sunset is quite also a good um something to take into account. Uh northeast. Sunrise. It's east, yeah, east. No, east. We we have sun in the morning only. So it does mean that the three piece room which is in the opposite of the northeast is the most sunny one. Let's say that. It's it's the one you have of now, you both. More or less. You get the sunset then. No? And it's really warm and Do you Uh by the way, is it a six floor building or is there more Okay. So it's warm. Mm. Okay. Mm. So how many rooms and uh how many place do we have? Yeah, plus one spare place, but really the last place to be used. Yeah. Okay. We got two, three, four, six, nine Fourteen places? For fourteen people? Yeah. T Okay. Bless you. So Can we group people by their name? I to Marianne. So it's gonna be Mariannes' office. Yeah, that's going that can be. That's boring, but that can be a good idea, but do do we can we do that? Because there is No we can't, because No we can't, there is two And two three person room. Yeah. So Mm. Yeah yeah. Yeah. I think we clear the things a little bit up too s Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So let's have a break. Save your file. You have X_P_? That's nice.",IB4001
"You can write on the paper, yeah. It's it's okay. Right. Right, right. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Okay. I have a question. Is the scale linear or is Mel scale, like in M_F_C_C_? Is it bar scale, like in like in sp yeah, okay. The overlapping is different, right? Yep. Mm. Okay and? Okay. Uh-uh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. I have never done anything. Yeah, tri-band G_S_M_, yeah. Different frequency. Yeah, exactly. Mm-hmm. Okay. True. Mm. Mm-hmm. I've never done any coding in my life. So I just have one curiosity. So this is coding then s you code the speech, then you're also supposed to transmit the speech, right? Th let's say in G_S_M_ or something else. I remember when I was doing some image processing, there were techniques for compressing and then coding. So adding channel information on the image at the same time in order to save sound bits. You see what I mean? Exactly. I d was just wondering if there's some s someone was doing it with speech as well. Well actually, when you compress yeah, all like first you compress the signal, right? And then you al you add com some complexity to the signal in order to recover the error. So I was wondering if by any chance there was something like this in speech with the speech. You don't know? Okay. Well It's not the most difficult, right? Sure, sure. And and this was the problem actually because you were No not not in G_S_M_, definitely definitely not. Uh Okay. Then th they some, you know, source. So yeah. Okay. Just one. Yeah. Definitely. Is it good? Okay. Okay, thank you.
Yeah, at least on paper. Yeah. Yeah, at least you can write on the p Yeah, CELP. Yeah. Hmm. No, but Marius is it's similar stuff. No, Marius is also using like Hilbert transform and then Both. Yeah.. Uh is some kind of D_C_T_ or again yeah. Yeah, ok Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. How c Mm-hmm. Yeah. Because use linear phase or Yeah uh Oh okay. Yeah. Yeah. Same frequency. Yeah. For L_S_F_. Main bit rate. What is Good. Oh. Ah, okay. Hmm. Hmm. S Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Hmm. Oh yeah, type. Hmm. S Hmm. S so Oh okay. Smoothed? Or like apply more Hmm. Ah. Hmm. So after you're doing L_S_F_s so or like I mean how you're finally hand coding Ah. Oh. Yeah. So first you apply these triangle filters and then do L_P_C_ coding or like Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Filters. Yeah. Oh okay. Hmm. You can do the L_P_ analysis on each sub-band, yeah. Yeah, m yeah, ok Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So how many L_S_F_s you're using and Oh okay. So but you how many bands you're using? If you're you're not skipping any bands or like oh ok fifteen into twenty then. Like uh. Hmm. Ah. Oh yeah. But phase you're not encoding anything. Phase you're directly transmitting that. Uh no th Yeah, yeah, yeah. The phase of Hilbert envelope. You're not transmitting at all like. Yeah yeah, is noise. Fourier. Yeah. Yeah. So what is the CELP standard now? Like it's it's two kilo-bits per second? Or the Oh that two two kilo-bits per t Ah ok Ah. Some Yeah, yeah. But Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. But this is codec centred, no. You have code book. So Oh it's not codecs code book. There is not code book. Oh ok Oh. Yeah, CELP is Yeah, it's it's it's around one kilo-byte like. Yeah. Yeah, that's a, I think, even G_S_M_ and all this, G_ seven two nine. Yeah, yeah. On based on CELP. At least it gives But still they use a code book, no. So that's really uh it's maybe better than like using just random noise or Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. Yeah. Ah, okay. Hmm. But Hmm.. Inverse, yeah. Inverse Hilbert. Yeah. Yeah. Or output signal like Yeah. And then yeah. Yeah yeah. Hmm. Oh ok Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. But yeah but it's more towards industry, no. Like the yeah, because I worked in a industry for like a small time. But they're they used to implement all these coders, G_S_M_ and I_T_U_ standards. No, just before my P_H_D_. for like few months. Yeah, but that's uh like industry it's really a big deal like. So they they they work on a lot of these standards. Yeah. But mostly they're all based on CELP like mainly. Yeah. So How? Tri-band is G_S_M_. C_D_M_A_. No no, but C_D_M_ is there but now slowly they're introducing G_S_M_ also now in U_S_ like. Yeah, G_S_M_ tri-band. Like the frequencies are different, like very uh Ah. Yeah. Now it's really big competition. Yeah. Standard maybe like established. Yeah. So where do you think your thing is useful? In C_D_M_A_ or G_S_M_? I think maybe in C_D_M_A_ it may be m C_D_M_A_ is more like More time domain. The they they are c doing only Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you know really the these long line telephones, they already have delay, no. At least half a second or yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But mobile m And this one is Uh harmonics and the Yeah. And then picking yeah. Yeah. But maybe the bit rate is the problem, no. Like what David was doing. Like it's really uh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, maybe you can just see how many how many harmonics. He was using twenty, I think. Like yeah, maybe you can try to reduce. Yeah. Yeah. And the f And then all this amplitude. Ah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Each again. Some kind of linear yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some function or like a Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. The size of the But you don't do any voice un-voice decision, no? Yeah, the that's even advantage I think for this approach. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. sorta the modelling, it's really another issue like. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then you have to combine all this harmonic model and noise model. So again you may end up some. 'Cause Oh okay. The pe peak uh Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. S Yeah. Yeah. So that's a you have to tune lot of parameters like I am. But anyway, you don't really need hard decisions, no? Like voiced unvoiced. So m maybe it may help you, but it yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. But do you really really need it or like voiced unvoiced? Yeah, but yeah. Yeah. But it's not really you need t you don't need to specify at each point it's voiced or yeah. Huh. Yeah. And then amplitude. But you're telling even frequency's also shifting, no? Like your delay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So then, yeah, then it's not exactly amplitude modulations or it's it's in between maybe. Yeah. S yeah. So yeah. Yeah.. That's what Marius did, no, like. But but he was keeping all the phase information. No, but even the his coded like he just he he didn't do anything, he just transferred it that way. He was aiming for he's not really kind of doing speech coding, but he want to do it on music. So he doesn't really care about the band-widths or he want to have the quality, no, like. Yeah, but even especially the audio series and the that that's what he was telling like. Yeah, at least even ten K_ bit. Twenty kilo-bits also is okay. So but he's uh he's not I think finished with all that thing. He's just transmitting all the phase and then but he's encoding the envelope, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then leaving the phase, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, or Auto-correlation coefficient and Yeah, they again give the phase. Yeah, again give the phase. Yeah. Oh. Hmm. But this phase is different from your carrier, no? Like yeah. Because you're just doing on uh your uh yeah. And also like yeah. And Yeah. Hmm. But even you can use as a can you use that phase directly? Whereas the d yeah, this one is direct But this is phase of your d uh spectrum, no? Like it's not in time domain. So Of your signal. It's not so then it's bit tricky. Like how Okay, but still you get only the the magnitude of your Hilbert envelope. You won't get the No, but you started with Hil Hilbert envelope, no? Like magnitude of Hilbert envelope. Magnitude of uh no, before D_C_T_ your d oh. Yeah. Ah, ok so input to the D_C_T_ is the speech or like your yeah, okay. Just you're starting with Ah. Ah. Ok ok ok Yeah, maybe the then Yeah. Ah okay. Yeah, it's in frequency domain, no. Yeah, definitely it's d But now I think people Yeah. Yeah. So when is your turn? Uh Oh. Oh okay. I mean just before. Oh you.. Low bit rate. Yes. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah, you know, the the Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Uh. No no no, yeah. Yeah. But it's mostly like this is uh s CELP and these thing. No, I was t uh doing some uh like writing some code for testing and these things where I'm making some t standards for that. So so th th there are like li the thing, these standards, how it works is like they give all the pseudo code kind of thing and then they put severe test conditions. So you have to pass those test conditions. Like then j you can say okay, we implemented D_ seventy eight or D_ se Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's why it's really even the t standards they give the test signals also. You are t you can't really do it on whatever database you have. So so you are to use the uh uh yeah. Uh it yeah, it's more like uh they define. So I did for some even also. They're also they define all this the speech condition. Everything they define. So you need to follow all those. Yes, this industry is again different like, yeah. Yeah, I think there isn't only se most yeah. Ah. CELP is from uh A_T_ and T_, no? Like A_T_ and yeah, yeah. It the all this L_P_C_ stuff is Yeah. Ah, ok Ah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The Yeah, that's the main thing even. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like I. Voice over I_P_ or yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And again, lot of this stuff like whe even when I was working mostly that company was developing for voice over I_P_. So they're to put all these things on again D_S_P_s. And also it's mostly like how to how many L_P_C_s are yeah, how many co yeah, it's optimation and then it's even Yeah. Again, now now now even they're also becoming yeah. Even the memories are not really yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So even I think uh then you can have whatever band-width is. It's short really. But no, I think uh but still then that's what maybe people are going toward sign sort of modelling, no. Like I was before when the bandwidth conditions were really stringent then they were using all the p L_P_C_ based source filter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, if you want you can look at his code and. But only th yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But definitely it's better than co coded speech, no? Different. Yeah, it's really but uh how much you can get the compress these like what you're telling is you can do all these tricks like. Yeah, these yeah. In yeah. Well yeah, I read uh I reviewed one paper like yeah, the that's that's from no. Yeah, maybe you can look at dates from uh you know east of uh east uh yeah, East Anglia. Yeah. Uh this uh e east University of East Anglia, Ben Milner. Yeah. I yeah, it's yeah, I can forward you that. They're doing lot of tricks. They're like they're again training Gaussian mixtures for different frequencies and then but they can they're following the yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No no, the those things are again based on L_P_C_, no? Like mainly like yeah. Whereas like the pitch estimation in in the X_ waves or these things, they're all dynamic programming based on again L_P_C_ analysis. Yeah. And then construct that. Huh. Yeah, again like uh no, the problem is different for everybody. Like these guys, what they're doing for distributor speech recognition mainly, this uh so. Uh yeah, M_F_C_C_s. So No, it's E_T_S_A_ or something. European Standard yeah Hynek really n yeah, even it's h kind of Aurora framework. So yeah. No, but now it's bit. Yeah, now they're And then yeah, M_F_C_ s But even at distant point they're planning to use for j uh standard D_S_M_ or D_S_ it's not? Or Yeah. E_ uh E_T_S_A_I_, yeah. European, yeah, commission. So M yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, i yeah, all these standards are really okay. Yeah. But Yeah. But the quality again problem, no like? No no. The the eu again, European standard, what this give us, they give the M_F_C_C_s and they give the pitch. Then you are to construct the thing. But if have M_F_C_C_s then like again you have to get the high order M_F_C_C_s and then yeah, then you're have to Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Mm. Yeah. But I think again it's different, no? Like these standards again, all these G_S_M_ standards. Maybe they have the compression standards and again coding stand but maybe uh I I read ah yeah. I don't remember anything like yeah, they're doing yeah, combi yeah, the even even G_ even normal G_ seventy nine, normal speech coder. So they have the speech coding standards again. They are these channel coding. So yeah. So it's mm. Yeah, b Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Again, yeah, i So okay? Yep. Th thank you then. Oh.
Oh my God. Yeah.. Okay. I should start? Yeah, no so I thought that we might s t speak a little bit about speech coding because nobody is doing here speech coding and I would like to have some maybe feedback because except me. I've I've supposed to some speech coding stuff here with Hynek uh but you know that little bit at least that uh based on some let's say Hilbert transforms using a longer temporal context and deriving some parameters would be tranf transcs transmitted to a decoder and So it's a little bit different than the stuff which people are using now, which is like a L_P_C_ based. And but we are at the beginning with everything more or less. So still um we can't uh d encode a speech. But of course there is there are many problems which we still didn't solve and the biggest one is quite similar to L_P_C_ stuff where people still don't know how to exactly encode a carrier or the source signal. We know what to do with the envelope or how to approximate the envelope, let's say. Um when you have got Oh you mean that it would be nice to plot at least s Um maybe I I can I can So what we are doing now, yeah, you mean. Okay, i uh everybody knows L_P_C_ stuff, how it works. So I don't have to present anything mores. But it's uh m more or less very simple. We have let's say at the beginning there is some speech signal. What we are uh we might see it uh in very simple way that we are using some Hilbert transform h at the beginning to create analytic signal. The analytic signal is the signal which is a complex which you can create from the uh real uh uh some sequence. And if you get if you apply Hilbert transform on this, on such a speech signal, like a real trajectory, then you get a complex signal and if you take just the amplitude, then you get Hilbert envelope code. So I well I I don't know. Yeah, let's say ups. Yeah, it's u it's not P_L_P_ at all, d Mm. No he's it's pretty much the same. Uh you're lit I know what you mean with the pu P_L_P_. They are applying P_L_P_ with some iteration with this this one approach. So they are doing some smoothing of a spectrogram in two ways. One was right. Right. But P_L_P_ is using just the spectral uh direction. Let's say you are doing uh for every twenty millisecond processing one one feature vector. Here you are processing one spectral band, frequency band, right. So it's different direction which we are w using. But anyway, this is very simple. So applying that uh absolute uh absolute operation, you get a Hilbert envelope. And of course then there is the phase. So it's just the complex operation. And that's more or less all what we are doing. So now what we know what we know is how to approximate that Hilbert envelope. We are ap we are applying that Hilbert uh him what is the Marius' uh stuff. So he knows how to encode uh the Hilbert uh envelope using like L_S_F_s or L_P_C_. You are applying again to some linear prediction model after that. But it's uh right, it's in a it's a little bit difference in not applied in the frequency domain. So instead of classical L_P_C_ domain, where you have a spectrum, let's say something like that, and you are applying some linear prediction model which is trying to approximate the spectrum, right. So this is frequency. In our case we are we are trying to approximate s kind of instantaneous energy. So if this is a time, and you get one and add one frequency band, you can see something like this. And we are trying to approximate that envelope which is that Hilbert envelope. Right? So again, we know what to more or less we know what to do with the Hilbert envelope. We know that we can apply linear prediction model and it works pretty well. But i if you want to really construct the speech signal or the you need also the phase signal, which is in uh some sense quite simple for voiced speech signal, say. But s uh the phase no, you ac It's a phase or you can encode it like a carrier. So the carrier is, if you know, uh amplitude modulation, right? You may see something like there is one cosine which is uh very would have quite a f right. Yeah. It's called like the phase. Right, right. Exactly. So the this is the signal which you also have to somehow encode or transmit from a code of the decoder in order to re-synthesize it, right. So What do you mean? Again. For this one? For the the linear prediction model? Well it's uh just a linear prediction. Classical way. I mean oh, okay, w well, if you want to see it in more details, I mean Oh, you mean uh yeah, bit bit rate you mean? Okay, yeah. Sure, sure. So whereas we are what we are now is, let's say, something like one point two kilo-bits per second for uh that Hilbert envelope. Is It's again a roughly estimated somehow. But we still know that we can go down and right. Exactly, yeah. I don we are using like fifteen bands. Right. But they are first they are inter oh well, integrated into fifteen bands using oh classical way like in M_F_C_C_s or in P_L_P_. You just apply some those uh triangular windows or something like that in order to to get a li really like just fifteen bands, right. And each band is then processed independently. So for one band we more or less have w like w one hundred bits per second. For Hilbert envelope. Right. Right, right. You yeah, you can just right. Right. Right. Yeah. Uh right, that's what we did. Yeah, sure. Sure, sure. Yeah. There are many things we would wouldn't at all. But yeah, exactly. But now what I r really trying to do is somehow approximate that uh carrier signal, to do something with the carrier. There are many simple things which you can do like uh quantization quantization, for example. Right. You mean something like uh f uh that CELP coding system where you're or wh wh wh what is no, what is exactly scalable system? What you mean by that? Oh yeah, yeah, sure. This was yeah. For dif yeah, right. Right, right. Yeah. But I think this appr approach can do that because you really can split it into several bands. And you can decide how many bands you want more or less. So Yeah, this is a bar scale we are using. Yeah, or Mel Mel scale, so it's uh it's being uh more wider for higher frequencies and of course the s the spaces right. Yeah. But what I w my sense is that it is not so much important still. I mean it doesn't matter if you're als use Mel scale or bar scale. But right, yeah. But that's what we are using, yeah. Uh actually we are using just Gaussian windows here instead of those triangulars because they are more uh no, it's better than for decoding it's better to play with them because they they are not zero anywhere, you know. They are they are approaching or in they are in zero. But actually they are not. So d you don't have to care about some zero values here and but more or less it doesn't matter, yeah. We are using just Gaus Gaussian windows. Okay, so l those are that the Hilbert envelope is um is approximated by linear prediction. So you have L_P_C_ coefficients which you can transcribe into L_ L_ L_S_F_s, which are right, exactly. Yeah. Right, exactly. So first uh the approach is quite sim simple. So at the beginning we apply D_C_T_ in order to get to frequency domain. Then you apply those uh triangular or Gaussian windows. So this is done for one second, eight thousand samples for eight kilo-hertz sampling frequency, right? So for such D_C_T_ trajectory you apply those uh Gaussian windows. And then i so you split it in two frequency sub-bands. And then each one f frequency sub-band is more or less uh Right. Right. Exactly. You just apply L_ L_P_, so auto-correlation let's say, or you can do power spectrum, whatever. Yeah, so you for each one you get L_S_F_s here. Uh well, I'm using now like twenty L_S_F_s per one second, per one frequency band. Fifteen. No no. If I just keep all them so twenty L_S_F_s, each one is um is quantized by four or five bits. Of what? Three hundred bits? Two. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You mean this phase, the the Hilbert carrier? Or no, of course we did Yeah. Uh w well, there are many things you can do. We don't well the first thing what you can really do is just to replace it by Gaussian noise. So you can really use t like in uh L_P_C_ system. Right. Exactly. Or you can replace it by some cosine, one cosine generated in a cen centre frequency of that Gaussian window. Right. Yeah. It mi it mi yeah. Twelve hundred? Yeah. Yeah, it's possible, some of it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. R right. Well I'm just comparing with uh L_P_C_ ten standard, which is like classical L_P_C_. A little bit optimized. So there in the there is I think two point four kilo-bits per second, the bit rate for that. Yeah, definitely. This is no, uh I mean L_P_C_ ten is just L_P_C_. No no no. No. Just noise or just those impulses. CELP. Yeah there yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Four point eight or something. Right. Yeah, sure. Well more or less what we didn't do is analysis by synthesis, right. So that's what CELP is doing, right. So yeah, so this is what we do and uh that might help a lot, of course. But w yeah, exactly. That's that's the question. It will be. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure. For example, uh there what I also did was uh a simple peak peaking algorithm. So if you take a look on that spectrum of that of that carrier signal, which is more or less like the cosine if you really take a look on that. But it is kind of frequency shifted cosine or frequency modulated cosine. Right, so it's th the frequency still to be changing. Or of course the amplitude is just not constant all time. It should be theoretically. But practically it's not. So what you can see for a one second signal, you m more or less you already might see some like one one uh impulse there or spectral line for. But usually there are many others which are s quite small, but they are quite important. If you don't transmit them, then the signal is quite robotic or something like that. So if you're really transmitting just one spectral line. But this is what you can do. And you can understand pretty well. The signal is audible. Or if you're adjust uh th find one one line, one speaker and dom dom dominant one in the spectrum of that c uh carrier Hil Hilbert carrier, and you just transmit this parameter. No, n It's even easier because what you have to do is just divide the you just multiply that Hilbert envelope by the table carrier. That that's all. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. So so you just multiply that uh one Hilbert carrier, which is transcribed by L_S_F_s by that this one I_F_F_T_ signal. So Oh f you mean the phase of that uh of that carrier? Of of course I try to play also with that, and uh I found that it doesn't matter so much which what is the phase because we are using just one second window, right. So of course there there might be uh some uh disturb uh disturbed uh when you concatenate those segments together. But then the phase might be important. But otherwise, I mean, I didn't find any anything important with the phase. Like great, keep the phase zero and it works. Or Right. Right right right. Yeah. But it's again a little bit different, because they are i they are doing this in a frequency domain. But this is in time domain, more or less. Right. The spectrogram, you mean. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. Exactly. What we can also do very simple is just to get the magnitude spectrogram using this approximation without the carrier, just Hilbert envelope. But you just uh get it in in this way, in in the way of Rob's, right. But you can also get the s short time Fourier transform uh and keep it right. Just classical uh frame by frame algorithm, twenty milliseconds. Uh but you keep just the phases instead of magnitudes. And you can put this together, right. And it works pretty well, and then the signal is not uh just uh whispered. Then you really hear that there is the voiceness in the signal. But uh of course the quality is uh is not so good still. But uh you can use it for like two, three kilo-bits per second and it works. Like yeah. Right. Right. Yeah, sure. Anyway, so um hmm m maybe it would be nice if you t if you tell us uh what you do with the speech coding 'cause I d I didn't see any of P_H_D_s of you, I think. So if you did something so maybe it would be interesting at least to Yeah. Yeah, sure. It's true. So you were when when did you do that? Oh okay. Uh-huh. I think so, yeah. You mean using that uh C_D_M_A_? Or Yeah, it's not G_S_M_. Right it's uh kind of s no C_D_M_A_ is uh another level, I think. Mm-hmm. I think there is a l lot of money in that like, right. Like speech recognition, of course it's very interesting, but people don't use it so much as s just coding, just telephoning, right, or just Right. Yeah. They s yeah, yeah. Right. Right. No, I I. Well what we were what we were thinking about is oh, C_D_M_A_, I mean there is the b Well, the problem is this in with this application, or it doesn't have to be problem but one constraint is that we are processing one second of the signal. You can go down of course. But then you are losing little bit of the bit rate, let's say, right. So but there are many applications where you really can use it because you don't care about algorithmic delay, one second algorithmic delay, like for I don't know if instead of S_M_S_ you can really have some channel where you just right. Um so probably. Right, right. Yeah. Right. Yep. Right. What if s Which one, s oh Well, but the sinusoidal coding is usually m when you s at least what I think or uh what I know is when you are doing sinusoidal coding it means you just take the speech signal at the beginning, right. And you are trying to find to uh yeah, to find the harmonics in a temporal domain, right, for that. Right. Oh. Yeah. Right. More or less I did it maybe different way, but kind of algorithm like okay, trying to find out the strongest or the the most dominant peaks in the spectrum, which is more or less the same. But th But you know, the the f the interesting Right. Right, and that that's it. And then you do multiples of right. Yeah. Yeah. Like it If it is unwrap you mean. Unwrap uh phase. Right. You l right, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I also play with that. And for example what I found i well, in this case uh we are not trying to encode the speech signal. We are trying to encode some carrier, which is much easier, I would say, because you can really im you can see that even. So what I was trying to encode at the phases, so I just found that uh two bits is enough for that and you really don't hear the difference. So if you keep all the spectral lines as they were there but you were just uh quantizing with two bits or three bits for amplitude, two bits for for phase. So it's okay. The problem is that you have to transmit many of them. 'Cause there is not just one dominant component but usually more others which are quite small, right. Or what you have to do then you have to decrease the the the size of not one second, but you have to go down because then you can get just voiced part and unvoiced part. You know, one second it's usually mixed right somehow together. Not now, no. I wi Uh uh we don't no want to do that, yeah, because it's quite tricky. Right. yeah, sure. Exactly. Right. But for example what we also found is that if you use just the Hilbert envelope, that that one which is trying to approximate that energy in some low band, like ar around two hundred t uh hertz, and you take a look on the signal, on the trajectory, you can see that it works like kind of um voice detector. Because uh for a low energies there is usually noise. For high energies there is kind of a harmonicity. So it works pretty well for that. So we might use this one information for that. But Yeah, I think so, yeah. Mm-hmm. Right. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's true, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's that's a problem. Sure. Uh f That would be nice n not to have anything, yeah. Right. Yeah, yeah. My Mm-hmm. Right. Exactly. Well I don't know. Maybe if you we uh really want to improve the the quality, then we will need it, I don't know, still. N not now. Yeah, uh well, I'm gonna t have a time next next month or in three weeks so I'll try to play some examples there for you and What we are trying to reconstr How does it look like or sure. Yeah, more or less. It's kind of uh not frequency. Let's say amplitude modulation when you have ju just the carrier and that modulation signal, right. Yeah, we yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. It's in between, exactly. So it's not this and that. But still yeah. But anyway what also the other approach which is possible to use. The other is one to keep the phase like this one, like two spectrograms, one the phase and one the magnitude. And well I can again play it and it works on two kilo-bits per second. Quite what uh no, what uh he was doing he was using it for speech recognition, what I what I know, but for speech coding no no no, it was I don't know. For speech coding you mean? I don't know. I don't know. M maybe. Right. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well for example this phase information right. Yeah, yeah. I think so. There are m more papers which are using this approach, like trying to encode the magnitude spectrum or spectrogram. Uh the phase or you just uh re can again the phase can be replaced by the noise, which is pretty good. So that's uh the benefit uh variable approach. So if you really don't have a band width, you just can replace it by noise and it works. Of course then it doesn't sound as the original because it's more whispered or whatever. But you can understand well. And for example uh if you mention this one approach with the that uh trajectory of the phase, of unwrap phase recre uh I also use because you can do it here when you get into uh this domain where you apply uh or you're trying to compute uh s power spectrum in in order t let's say that this kind of trajectory, it doesn't in fit the same frequency over time domain. But here you are trying to compute uh doing a to do linear prediction. So we are just doing F_F_T_, right. Then applying uh power in order to get um to s to power domain, and then I_F_F_T_, right. So you get the auto-correlation coefficients. So before you're applying uh power spectrum, you can again get the you have got a complex f freq frequency or complex spectrum, you can get the phase, right. And the phase look quite similar like this. So you might see it's is more less like a line. Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah, it's it is very different, yeah. Then you are doing in different domain. I think this is in frequency domain, this in time domain. Um it is quite it's quite sensible to any quantization, what I found. Really it looks like the lines. So you just say okay, let's p let's put the line there. But it doesn't work. Re well, you can understand. But you can here that there are many artifacts which right, exactly. Right, right. And the another problem is that uh it's not band width variable. So you cannot say that this part will be the just the noise, which you can do in here in this this other approach. So that's why I didn't play with that so m more because I found there are more uh disadvantages than the advantages, this approach. So that's why. You mean this one? Yeah, if you take just the original phase and the Right. Yeah, it's it's it's not a phase. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the phase no, you can again put the that envelope with this phase together because envelope is twe No no. You g no, you get the f Yeah, you get the complex complex spectrum with this. No, no, I started with the D_C_T_ No, after D_C_T_ you are trying this is so kind of again a real trajectory, right. And you're trying to first find that Hilbert envelope. So uh let's well so this is a speech. No, but here what I want to say is really that y it's not part of Hilbert envelope, it's part of the D_C_T_ signal. So it's not it's enough if you have just this phase and f and the Hilbert envelope, you can put it together. You don't need the carrier. I mean this is kind of a carrier signal but in different domain represented. Right, right. So I what I think is that we already will need to apply s kind of analysis by synthesis approach mm uh in order to get something. Right. What I No. You mean ye Right. Right, right. Yes, that's true. But I mean that's maybe even the advantage here because you it's not speech d based, which means we are not Right. So you can when I tried and comparing with L_P_C_ ten on a uh twice bigger or higher bit rate, this work works better, it seems to me. Just for unvoiced speech. O I'm not mentioning uh voiceless because that's unvoiced, which means whispered. Uh yeah, but uh when you hear and try to use some examples with the music for example Right, yeah. Mm-hmm. That's true, yeah. Uh but anyway, it seemed to me pretty good. I mean that there might be. that's true, yeah. Uh it should be uh thirteenth December I think. I just uh you won't be here. Uh okay. No, I just swapped it with uh Mike Perrot I think 'cause h he is not going to be here this time. And I was supposed to have it in uh in January. So whatever. Anyway. So But anyway, I I wanted to hear something maybe from you what you are doing f with speech coding because you were you mentioned that By But it was based on like you were using kind of recognizer there, right? Uh-huh. Right. Right. Yeah, it's I'm I mean yeah, it's different. But uh it's speech coding at least. I think so. Right. Yeah, sure. Band you mean? Right. With different I don't know. But maybe what we can already do is uh to decrease this uh this distance. We can do a Hilbert envelope approximation with one second. But then we can split that signal into, I don't know, ten ten uh segments with the one hundred milliseconds or even less, and we can apply some other technique for that, you know. Still Right. Exactly, exactly. Yeah. Well, th more less they don't care what's uh what will be the quality of the of the or the bit rate, they just want to get something new, you know. So if you get the v very uh low bit rate with a reasonable quality or really high bit rate, which is c again different, but with uh high quality, uh they would be happy with the both. So You know, on one side it's pretty good but on the other you don't know which way you should go 'cause there are many of them. And uh Right, right. Okay. Well I I will W uh do you want to mention your speech coding experiments? So you are saying that you're doing something i in India with uh So you know the sub mm like um more details? Oh yeah. Okay. Right, right. Right. I see. Yeah, but it's quite interesting with the even with th uh s current speech coding uh technologies. We are they are still trying to use k zap or those R_P_ based approaches. There is nothing new, more or less. And if I when I was uh listening the uh the talk of uh Milan Jelinek, uh he's the Czech guy, but he lives in uh in Canada. I don't know the name of the university. But they they have uh the pattern I think for CELP even. Or Um I don't know how it is exactly but they got very very famous for this for that CELP. What they did exactly I don't know, if something different a little bit or not, or they just keep those patterns or I don't know how it is exactly. Maybe Hynek will know much more. But uh when I heard those that presentation, they didn't do so much new. I mean uh it was last year and uh I think Hynek, he was asking wh so what's new that you are so famous with that and they n they said okay, we we know exactly how to do that. I mean you know, not to make any errors like in because everybody knows how to do that. But uh it's not so easy to implement it, right. So uh there is nothing so much new really like. Yeah. Right. Right. Exactly. Right. Right, ri right, exactly, exactly. But then they are s still using like error signal, which is going to be approximated by code book, right? And a linear prediction, which is use which is approximating just the spectrum of for for and everything that that's that's all. So still Right. Yeah, yeah. Right. Well, I hope that we still have a a lot of time for that because uh I think yeah, it's pretty interesting, yeah. For example when I was uh you know, harmonic voice modelling, that H_M_M_ system which is using used for synthesis more less. It's pretty interesting. I mean it it works it works well. Right. Right. Yeah, yeah, it is. You mean uh in sinusoidal uh modelling? Yeah. And but anyway, do you know exactly how it is done when you really have those M_F_C_C_ coefficients, which means magnitude spectrum, and then you are trying to reconstruct the speech? Without a phase. Because I I tried you know those th those papers. But s I'm little confused about it. I don't know how it works. But Which one? Yeah, that would be nice. Oh. You know, m but there are some algorithms which were quite uh Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Uh it seems to me, yeah, something like that. Like try You know what you can do um maybe. What you can do is uh take just the minimum phase of which you can get from a linear prediction, right? You know what I mean, minimum phase signal. And it sounds quite uh reasonably the two. But of course they are li it's not original at all. So I don't know how they do that exactly. No, I've no idea. Right. True, right. For n for Aurora we didn't do anything with that. Yeah, but we didn't do any speech recon re reconstruction. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, sure. Right. Right. Right. Right. You mean with this phase uh sure. Yeah. Yeah, they do some kind of reconstruction of speech. Uh yeah. Right. That's true, yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sure, yeah. Okay. So how about you? Yeah. Yeah. You mean like channel and source coding together? Or no. Well I can imagine kind of like J_ PEG operations, which might be more less like it's source coding and then we also channel coding because we just smooth the or just I don't know. I don't know. Right. Right. Right. R right, right. I don't know. I don't know so much about s channel coding, like those Huffman coding stuff and, you know. I mean it's just standard. Yeah. They're just standard techniques. But Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. I think so. H yeah. end. Okay. Thank you guys. Uh if you find some good paper which you might There was that fam fam waveform pro prototyping cor
Yeah, still doesn't feel natural. I I wish, you know, the the the the room would just detect when an when a meeting's started it starting. Voila cool. So you better start. It was your idea. So. Well maybe uh is is the white-board working? Or or not. Um y maybe show us the general sort of outline. You keep w okay, you can just write it on the paper. Yeah. So is this different from the original P_L_P_ two stuff then, is that? Uh 'cause that's what you started with, wasn't it? This this stuff that Marius Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. H he's parameterizing it both temporally and across the spectrum, yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yep, okay. Yep. Yeah, to that. Yep, yep, yep. Mm yeah, but it's a it's a it's a different linear prediction model, isn't it. It's a complex linear prediction or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Okay. You need the phase. Ooh uh Well Well it depends on how this i I mean you're talking b yeah, just the carrier. Okay, so it's not necessarily phase, but if you're using some sort of sinusoidal coding, it's phase, yeah. Okay. Okay. W What so what sort of bit rate do you get for the um encoding of the this the Hilbert transform? The s the spectrogram. W what sort of coding do you get so far for the no no no no, f f yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yep. Uh wo well, it's no no no, but what sort of bit rate do you get? Is it is it uh id do you have any sort of m idea of what sort of band-widths? Yeah. 'Cause Okay, and that's in that's with the fully optimised sort of compression scheme or that's just the raw data or? Okay, yeah. Yeah. Sure, sure. You just cut out m bands and just use interpolation or whatever. Yeah. T so that's one point okay, that's with the full spectrum basically being used then. Yeah. Yep, yep. Yep. Yep. Yeah, yep. Okay, that's quite good. So and Hynek was showing me how scalable it is in terms of um you can take half the bands away and still get decent performance. You take you take three quarters of them away, it starts to degrade, but it's still intelligible, that sort of thing. Yep. Okay. And that's without doing any sort of um prediction of what the missing bands might be, right? You just leave them out. I mean you you shou you could be able to do some sort of code missing data sort of Bayes stuff, yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. It it would be it would be nice to have a scalable scheme though, wouldn't it? Like because you've got a nice scalable scheme for the for for the the coding of the the smooth spectrum. It'd be nice to have some sort of scalable coding scheme for the for the voice signal as well, right? Well, I don't know, I'm just Well, at different bit rates. So the actual uh excitation as well. Because I mean it'd be nice uh l let's say if you had twelve hundred bits for the for the sp smooth spectrum and twelve hundred bits for the voice, and then you could scale them both. Yeah. Sure, sure, sure. Yeah. Uh No no. Just long as it's some sort of non-linear. Yep. M The place more emphasis on the Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. And then vector quantize or whatever. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. So times fifteen. Twen that's t it's twenty times fifteen, it's not Okay. So it's it's yeah, it's three hundred. It I mean it's it's total of three hundred sort of parameters per second. Um Well, y you're not you're not carrying transmitting that at all really at this point in time. I uh And and you get whispering type synthesis, yeah. Yep. Or one of these glottal pulse things. F and just use basic L_P_C_ ten style. Yeah, which is which is probably, I mean, if you're going to aim for like a very low rate code to below five hundred bits per second, I guess. That's that's probably fine. But Uh the lowest standard is MELP I think, which is twenty four hundred, the standard. It's been implemented at twelve hundred f bits per second using more more complicated quantization schemes and stuff like that, I think. I think so, yeah. I s I saw that they used matrix quantisation on the L_P_ uh on the L_S_F_ parameters or whatever. But I mean that's quite it becomes quite computationally intensive. But I mean I imagine the same sort of approach could be taken with yours as well. No. Yeah, that's the same. Twenty MELP*'s a lot better quality though. Yeah. ..No no. I think I think I think I think CELP or CELP or however you pronounce that. It's about forty eight hundred I think. Yeah. Well the standard's forty eight hundred or something, yeah. Yeah. Or based around that. Yeah. Okay. It's not terribly interesting though, really. Yeah. So I'm Well you you've well, I mean you've got a bunch of options, haven't you. You can use like uh a codec sided or you could use a Sinusoidal based. No. Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure, sure. Yeah, but what's more interesting? I I mean 'cause c I I I suspect there somethings like um CELP. You're gonna get h lot higher band-width, aren't you. I mean it's a high band-width standard. So yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Hmm. Okay. So I mean How Yep. Yeah. 'Cause it's a bit tricky, isn't it. That's it's not like a standard I'm just thinking, I mean what sort of opt it's not like you can't just do standard um, you know, inverse filtering for um signal reconstruction or anything like that, can you? Uh oh okay and then you just then you just do the inverse F_F_T_ or whatever. Okay, the oth I mean the other o Mm yeah. But that's gonna be susceptible to having phase problems, is that, when you Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Hmm. And now I mean there is there are um mm there is research uh um pu that's been published showing, you know, speech reconstruction from the essentially the spectrogram without phase information. Yeah. So Yes. Yes, but I mean you can reconstruct the the f the th the entire Spectrogram from that, can't you. So you could do it that way. Cause I'm just saying there's a heaps of there heaps of options. Like if y you be exactly the same as sinusoidal coding or something like that. All you need is the reconstruction of the spectrogram in order to estimate the harmonic amplitudes and Yeah. Yeah. Ye Just by refitting. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, okay. D it's th Yeah. But that's that's the big thing at the moment, isn't it. If if you're mm if i if the if the exci if the if the encoding rate's two kilo-bits per second for the the excitation component of the signal. It doesn't matter how efficient your um encoding of the spectrogram is, you're always gonna have a high relatively high bit rate.. Yeah. Nah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure. Well, one could argue it's it's a field that's quite a sort of a niche these days, isn't it. Um In standards and yeah. Mm yeah. Well did you say uh who said Yeah. Is it Nokia's being sued in the U_S_ for their tri-band usage 'cause, you know, intellectual property. Uh no no, g G_S_M_ because they don't have G_S_M_ in the U_S_. Or I didn't have G_S_M_ in the U_S_. UH it's f uh okay. No no n Uh well that's tri-band, s yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yep. And apparently Nokia's in a bit of trouble over that one, but yeah. Well it's interesting. Yeah. Should've been a lawyer. Well that's But I mean coding is a much more sort of it's it's it well I mean it's it's uh it when it boils down to just mathematics to a large extent, doesn't it. It's it's just uh sort of it's, you know, communications s sort of No. Yeah. Sure, sure. Yeah. Sure, sure. Push to talk and stuff like that. Yep. And I mean, as you say, I mean that delay is, I mean you can squash that delay to some extent, right. I n I think as far as the co you know, c c Delilah's coding goes, I don't think you can probably do much more than what's already been achieved. Because to get higher compression you have to, you know, take advantage of redundancy over longer time spans. So Yeah, sure, but I mean that's transmission delay, not algorithmic delay. If you add those together you end up with a the nightmare scenario, I guess. We might have someone else joining our uh meeting soon. Oh yeah. I don't know, I mean uh you'd be you tried sinusoidal coding based approaches, didn't you? Sinusoidal coding. Yeah, but sure. Yeah, m yeah, tr yeah it's a yeah, but I mean the th the the thing is you'd need ti it part of the parameter set for that is uh the um uh the f uh the harmonic amplitudes. And then one way of compressing the harmonic amplitudes is just storing the smooth spectrum. And then you can uh and then you can interpolate yeah, you can just pick the the um the harmonic amplitudes on that spectrum when you reconstruct on that smooth version of the spectrum when you reconstruct. Y yeah. Well, I was just saying Yeah. Yep. Yeah, well I I th it's high. It's quite a high bit rate. But I mean once we it maybe it's something that's scalable. Well it I mean you can use as many harmonics as you want. I m h uh he was just using the fundamental frequency. And if you smooth it doing a smooth spectrum representation of the harmonic amplitudes, then you only need to store the the the fundamental frequency and and the and the maximum voice frequency. And everything else can be yeah, s yeah, sure. So, and then but then the tricky the only tricky thing that we hadn't figured out was the phase information. Um but y but uh you can still get a like you get th um basically if you do phase unwrapping and all of these other tricks, you end up with some sort of phase representation, which is some sort of monotonically decreasing function. Yeah, unwrapped, yeah. So I mean it's something that you could conceivably represent in some sort of low sort of r you know, low bit rate representation, I guess. And then maybe you'd need some sort of correction to um to correct minor phase discontinuities at some point in time. 'Cau Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Sure, sure. Yeah. Yep. Yeah, yeah. Hmm. No, and you uh you wanna avoid hard choices on voicing decision, yeah. Well that's one of the big problems with L_P_C_ ten for instance. I it stinks because this hard yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah, yep. But but that that two hundred this is what they use for like um st they they do use this for um for um pitch marking in speech. So this is what Alan Black's code uses. But it's very speaker dependent wh on what sort of band width you'd look at this Hilbert envelope. Depending on the pitch, depending on the person, y you'll get a different amount of smoothing and a certain sort of so I mean, you know, if it's a female speaker for instance you yeah. So it's sorta tricky. Yeah. Uh n no. Y yeah, but from memory that that basic script that they had wasn't wasn't very um effective. I mean maybe if you did some sort of initial first p guess and then and then chose your smoothing factor based on that. 'Cause it it you know, selecting at any particular point of what the what the pitch is at the may be inaccurate. But if you estimated it over a second, you should be able to get a decent estimate, I'd I'd think. Yeah. Well it'd be nice to it would be nice to really see what this what you're a actually trying to reconstruct here. This carrier signal, what what it really looks l yeah. And you did say it looks like a frequency modulated cosine. Hmm. Yeah. It would have to be 'cause pitch shifts yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yeah, it's like a yeah. And it it does start to get a little bit n non-linear towards the end. But normally that's that's when the components are not actually probably gonna be audible anyway in voiced speech, right. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. C C 'cause any sort of error in that in that line is is transmitted, is realised in a net as a phase error, right. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Mm yeah. Tricky, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Y y y you have s five slices like n across that way, I guess. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, that makes sense 'cause it's a time domain sort of approach. Um and I mean uh and and in in fact I mean it's what you're doing is so different to most approaches to speech coding that it doesn't matter that we don't know much about or haven't had much i it's I mean it's quite different to a lot of the traditional sort uh so uh voi um you know, source filter type approaches or or whatever, yeah. So It's just a matter of minimum distortion time. Yeah. Sure. Unvoiced unvoiced speech is very difficult to b sort of judge on quality compared to voiced, I think. Plosives. Yeah, plosives are very important though, I guess. So maybe it does a better job of plosives. Okay. It'd be nice if we had some demos here. Well, I suppose have to wait to your I guess. Oh it's a little wa oh bugger. I won't be, yeah. No. You'll practice it before then, won't you? Yeah, he's going to Oz. Yep. I did, yeah. But we're d we're doing a more traditional s s frequency slices rather than temporal based stuff. Yeah. Well that's w that was one of the approaches, sure. Yep. And the other approach was was this H_M_M_ based stuff, which is which is basically just a parameterization of the, you know, the the the the um the source filter type parameters, and then and then learning the, you know, training like a h speech recognition system. But that's not terribly that's got no relationship to this. I it's yeah. Yeah, sure. Speech coding. I I read some of the other techniques. Um little standards. But um I mean I think I think you're on the right track with the analysis by synthesis but that doesn't tell you how what sort of bit rates you're going to achieve or um and because you have to do it separately for each um band, it would be the I imagine that's the tricky part. Um because it would be varying quite rapidly, wouldn't it, your um your uh code book. Like w within each um when you go along the the the b the one second sort of segment of the band, you Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean yeah. First you've gotta choose your approach and not worry about the band-width, and then start thinking about how to given 'cause I mean I guess especially 'cause this is a this is a more of a commercial based project, you've g c you've you've gotta i match the quality before you start worrying about other things, right. I mean d d do they I mean what what what sort of uh Uh-huh, okay. Well that makes things uh With They're happy. Okay. Cool. Yeah. Sure, sure. And at the moment you're at sort of a point where maybe you have to make that choice a little bit. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh which is not Yeah. Yeah. Al although the standards, depending on what standard you're dealing with, sometimes it can be quite ambiguous, right. I mean all the M_ PEG standards are basically this is the container, we don't care how you do it, right, but it's gotta fit inside this this sort of this sort of format. Okay. And then you have the v and then you have to do M_O_S_ um testing and Okay. Well, ho it Okay. Mm. Yeah, yeah. Well, I th No, no, no. Uh no, no, no. Yep. Well the the what's what's new is in the transmission medium. Like you know, new like higher band width transmission or uh or like packet packetized based transmission. And then all th that sort of thing. The where th where they're they're not so much looking at the algorithm, but so much as how to incorporate the algorithm within a new transi mission sort of s medium. Basically s like I mean if you d if you see a lot of papers on like um on uh voice over I_P_ or whatever, the the publications are sort of like um how do we deal with packet loss, or or how was it affected by packet loss and and and things like that. Yeah, sure. Yeah. And optimization of the code and all that sorta stuff. Yeah. But even that's less of a big deal now, right, because all the little um I_ s yeah. Not really. You could trow Matlab on a mobile phone these days. Well, maybe not, but Yeah. Y yeah. Yeah, which David did, yeah. It's good, yeah. Yeah, we've got all his code implemented. So uh It wasn't perfect. There was little bit of bugs with some of the matching. But it was pretty hard to tell that it was m not not perfect unless you heard the samples sort of next to one another. So that's not too bad. Oh, sure.. And I mean it Well th The only trick is the phase. And we've got a student starting in January who's gonna start working on on how to actually efficiently parameterize the um the H_M_M_ yeah, yeah. And I think I think we've got a number of ideas for the the spectrum. That's easily enough handled just using standard techniques. But the Without phase? I've got no idea. Uh you reviewed a paper on a Uh Steven Cox, isn't it? Yeah. University of East Anglia. It's near c sort of it's it's near the sorta Cambridge side of England, I guess. No the much more mathematical, I think. Yeah, just basically doing a search through or or stuff stuff like that, don't they? Or Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah, yeah. Sure. Where you've only got the M_F_C_C_s. But th I think I think the I think it was to was it to do with Aurora or something? The Okay. I was Okay. Yeah, but it w it was for say um say you've got someone who has you know, they wanna dispute that this is what they actually said by the recognition. And the recognition network was wrong and you owe me money or whatever. Um and then they can say well we've we've reconstructed your speech from the speech recogni input to the speech recognizer. Hey voila it sounds like you uh Uh I mean obviously there's a lot more to it than that. There's a lot of sort of, well, does the quality stand up to legal sort of requirements or whatever. But um Oh no, that there's a separate set of standards I think for speech recognition. Y yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. Which uh I think requires, you know, that states the un the information they can send is this. So I don't know whether you tack on any extra phase information or whatever. You have to deal with what you're given. So Yeah. I don't know. I I it would be interesting. You I mean maybe that's the best approach to look at to begin with is just pretend all you have got is Yeah. Um because you can also interpolate the pitch information from the the spectrum as well. They do that. Yeah. So I mean maybe try to see how good you can go without transmitting any of that information. The pitch was really good, I thought. I th didn't think you could really tell. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but but the thing is if it's Mel scaled, if you have a Mel scale, you get quite fine reconstruction of the spectrum at the lower frequencies it which is what you need for reconstruction of the pitch anyway. So I mean if you wanted to transmit with fewer bands, you'd maybe still keep the lower bands or or maybe you could still transmit the pitch. The pitch isn't that big a deal. But it'd be nice if you didn't because then I mean that's well, I mean it's worth giving it a go and then men maybe seeing wh what information you can add to the data stream to improve performance. Um I don't know. That that'd be cool. So get coding. Mm I think w Ah, well I mean Huffman's easy enough. But but yeah, sure. Uh that that's where I stop. Run length encoding, I'm out of here. Okay. I mean I I th I think they do try to I mean obviously the the the techniques they they choose are supposed to be less, you know, susceptible to coding errors, let's say. You know, i but I mean that's maybe the the limit to that. Yeah. Okay. Okay.",IN1013
"Yep. S so Joel is going to talk. That's mine. Well, may from different point of view. But Yeah. Right. Let me just tell us so what you know already about uh, I don't know, how far you are with the s features. Or So you know s something like that. Mm-hmm. But t what Christos was doing. Right. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. What yeah, yeah. We shouldn't smile. Right. Yeah. Yeah, but I'm using that for different different reason, right. So it's uh speech coding. So uh what is the task is usual just take the speech of course somehow to encode it into as as small number of beat as possible and with a reasonable quality of course. And again to e uh decode it. And I'm using F_D_L_P_ for that, still playing with uh more less one second long segments. So just dividing the speech into one s one second frames doing D_C_T_. It's just the standard wor of work. And then doing some compression and computation of yeah, yeah yeah, sh oh, yeah. But you are doing the same, no? Yeah b yeah yeah you take the the D_C_T_ and you just divide it into several sub-bands, frequency bands with a different uh I d I do. You mean No, no, no. No. I don't do. Yeah, just one second with without overlapping. But in frequency domain there is a overlap. Because you can choose which filters you want, more less, or just trajectories of those bands. So there is overlapping. I'm using those Gaussian filters or classical those those TRAPet trapezoidal like in uh M_F_C_C_s, right. And then processing each f yeah, P_L_P_s. Okay, tr triangulars. That one. Then I'm doing s doing uh independent processing of each frequency band. So I'm computing that Hilbert envelope, which is just the envelope of some temporal trajectory. And more or less you can divide this into a Hilbert envelope, Hilb Hilbert carrier. We use something like L_P_, a linear prediction envelope. Auto-regressive model and excitation signal. Yeah, so those are two parts or items you need somehow to encode if you want again to get original speech or reasonable quality. And yeah, there is some compression factor, which is again when you're computing that auto-regressive model from F_D_L_P_. You can compress the spectrum somehow in in such a way that you rather um preserve those even also those dips, not only peaks in the spectrum. And it sounds better for some kind of speech signals. So it's kind of logarithm when you use logarithm for M_F_C_C_s, right. So it's again compression factor, something like th and but then you have to uncompress it again of course to get back the speech. And there other other things which I'm doing. But it's not related to speech recognition so much, or but Well Right, right. Well, it's yeah. Sure, sure, I know. I mean it's more or less the same approach, right. There is m uh just more right, right, right. Yeah. With what? Yeah yeah. Sure. Number of bands and You know, that's the problem for speech coding. Because I don't have results like in speech recognition. So of course I have to listen it and and s well so now what I'm using are fifteen bands, which seems to me fit fifteen frequency band, which seems to me quite reasonable. We can go down till like twelve and still okay I would say. But then you start hearing difference. Or also that's another problem. Once you can go down with frequency bands, then you will have much uh more c uh complicated data. Uh let's say excitation signal, or that carrier which yeah because broad bands, right. Yeah, maybe like that. No? So there is more and more s uh frequency components let's say or something like that in one broad band. So No. L_P_C_ will maybe. But then you have still another part, sometime something like a source and a filter. So when you are doing speech coding or Yeah. Why? I don't know now. It's quite long. Well I mean it's it's the same like when you are doing L_P_ L_P_ synthesis, right. So you've got source signal. I don't know. Source. Uh Yeah. And then there is some filter, which is that one divided by A_ Z_. And that's and that's it. And the source can be a noise signal or it can be some uh sequence of uh what is that? Pulses, right. This is yeah. So and it's more less or less the same what I'm doing. So this is some envelope, which is in our case related to Hilbert envelope. And this is a source signal which is Hilbert carrier. Right. Right. Exactly. Yeah. So this is now going to be frequency. Yeah. So more or less if we uh can we can plot it. So what we can see is some Hilbert envelope like this. And then there is that Hilbert carrier. Or this not Hilbert carrier. But this is the signal which we get from one di one frequency band. So you compute D_C_T_, right, from signal? Yeah yeah, exactly. And what we get from that is this Hilbert envelope, right. And the second, which should be that carrier should be something like this. It's just really close to cosine we m we might see if we do it do it properly, right. And this is what you also have to somehow transmit, or at least try to transmit in order to get Right, right. Right. No, I don't need L_P_C_. No, no. This is a residual for me. Yeah, I'm just wan I just want to transmit this signal right. It's and what you need is this envelope and this one carrier. And you again get the same signal, this this this shape, doing I_D_C_T_. Putting everything together. Right. But if you take a look for example for a s if you have a very g good music signal, which is very uh periodic you can really see something like there is one peak and And frequency more or less doesn't change. It's uh related to uh that frequency of the broad band or how it's called. If you add those filters, which are uh wider and wider this is that centre frequency which is somehow related to this one. So then you can transmit uh just fe It's worse and worse. Don't then you don't see any anything like cosine. But Right, right. Everywhere. It sounds like L_P_C_ when you excited by noise. It's better, I would say. Uh better quality. Definitely better quality. It lower bit rate. But that's a problem. So so ... Yeah, sure. Objective measure, well, it was some those uh distances, spectral distances well, Edinburgh saw probably. So well, I mean I h Alright. Yeah. Sure. I see. Right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Also there are papers about it that f if you have like twelve frequency bands it's somehow optimal. Compression is only to really to somehow feed that uh Hilbert envelope to yeah. Yeah, yeah. You can model it better. There is no echo or something like reve reverberance in the signal if you really go down with that compression factor to like zero point one, something that. Zero point one. So Right. It's it's s right. And it's still yeah. Yeah, you just preserve something different little bit. Let's say in R_S_S_. Yeah. I think Hynek has got ma many papers or some papers over that. So Oh. In I think I read it. Right, more or less. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Well I think you can really take those papers from uh Marius about F_D_L_P_. They are that's really enough on What is SAPA? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Just something. Right. Approaches. Mm-hmm. But there are also reports from IDIAP I think. At least two reports from Marius seem to me. Yeah, they are more less they are same like. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Right, right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Sometimes unreadable I would say. It's quite difficult, but yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think this year a lot uh Interspeech there was one paper. But it was regarded to speech recognition somehow. Y yeah, yeah. It was not something like speech coding or that D_C_T_ transforms. N nothing like that. So Right. Right. Mm. Maybe yes. Maybe no. I don't it's hard to say. Now it's not so bad with that if you really write it f well. And he did. I think so. Sure. R right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever. That's not important. Uh .. Oh yeah. Sure, it is important for this case. But still Right. Yeah, and definite. November? November. What are you going to t talk or to teach? It's just that perceptual stuff and Mm-hmm. Do you already know how many students you have? No. Oh it's graduate for graduates. Well I think Guillermo was thinking about. And Hmm. Well I would like to go there, but not just for credits. Just maybe to hear something new. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Oh, sure. A any I think so. Why you are you doing this. Good question sometime asking Right. Thank you.
Oh what what is the topic here? Well, I guess so. I couldn't. I would like to change. But I cannot. Well I think that I'm more now. Much more than me. Because Oh. Okay. Yeah. To the D_C_D_. Oh I cannot say it. To the Hilbert envelope you mean, no? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why that? I don't think so. Yeah, I just re-wrote in in C_ plus plus. I didn't do us so much on that. Well, we we tried uh many knobs to tune on th on that. Because you can decide what compression factor and everything. So I tried a little bit like um pick maybe three knobs and try to go through the three D_ three D_ cage to see what happens in which which kind of settings. So this we did. But we we didn't because there was still a question that I don't remember right now. Because there was some essential question I I don't remember, I would have to look at it f and because be before I wou before I we could u we could write anything I I would be have to be sure that something is right there. I couldn't be sure about it at the time. So and anyway, it it takes time, this this computation. It's it's very inefficient. It takes like hundred times more than computing some M_F_C_C_s computing these features, because it's uh huge D_C_T_, huge F_F_T_ everywhere. And Yeah. There is no optimisation. We just stick to the TRAP. We wanted to make as close to TRAP as is possible, which is silly, but that w you have to start somewhere. Yeah.. Y okay. So so what well, last time we we were s talking about what, about Gaussians? You you have the Gaussians running somehow. Like feature extraction. And then the tandem training c also, so the you are able to train the net now. No. No so they are going from ICSI? Huh. Yeah. Eh? But who who is the one who who is now developing the Quicknet and these things? The the M_L_P_ four and these things. Because it's It was Barry? Ah, I see. I see. Well still we have the experts who who made the software on here, you know. Olivier Bornet and Uh Quicknet training. Yeah. Yes, but Olivier make it run on on these machines and make the uh cross the two G_ barrier here at IDIAP. Because we couldn't we couldn't do something, I don't know what. But he is he is no good in Quicknet, right, I s I guess. Yeah. Um okay. So so? Right. So you just miss the back-end, which is easy because it's H_T_K_, it's everyone knows here. Okay. Yeah, okay. A and you you just need from us to hear w what are the other p front-ends and other features to to choose or something. Okay, so how do we do it? Shou shou should I list it? Or Yeah. Well, uh like I I d I distinguish between feature extraction and then the M_L_P_. Because see you feed something to the M_L_P_ which are not the waves. So so well and that's that's what I call it. And then the back-end. But okay. Well so what what I have here, what I've been working on since I was here was M_F_C_C_ P_L_P_, which is always needed for compressing purposes. Then TRAPs with w various lengths. And also uh you know TRAPs now? With var various lengths we were trying to to start them from from on the ultimate length of one one uh frame up to one second or even more. But it was mm so this. Also w then we apply the D_C_T_ on the TRAP itself, which is some something like the Gaussians. Applying some filt filtering. Basically the TRAP. So this. But this is mainly Franta who was doing this. So this is related to TRAPs. I was also trying the warping. Means if you have a second um which is uh a hundred and one samples, I was just keeping the central ten ten samples. And then I was throwing away some some of them, you know. Like with sampling this this uh one second of the TRAP to something which I which I uh preserved all the points in the centre and just uh picked every tenth point at the boundaries, which means the TRAP uh hundred and one TRAP trajectory shrank to say fifteen points with uh with still preserving the maximum resolution at the centre and throwing away most of the points near the boundary. So this I was trying. So these I have some results on. So these are TRAPs. Then the Gauss TRAPs. Then tandem system. Uh the tandem you plus minus half. Because that's that's just a P_L_P_s. And then there is a training uh with M_L_P_ that's taking some context of these P_L_P_ coefficients. So it's like feeding the P_L_ uh P_L_P_s or M_F_C_s, w whatever to M_L_P_ and taking some context. This is the tandem. So this set-up we also have here. I didn't experiment with this. But maybe you some more results oh it's Hemant who has the results on tandem I guess, no? Yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah. But uh I think the uh I think the most important results are already in the thesis he's writing. So so is there some somewhere. So this is tandem. Uh then uh then what? And then there is the F_D_L_P_. Then we can talk more about. Which is which I have more experiments on. Also this warping and compressions and all these things. So Well it's bil still sub-bands, no? Well yeah. But that you just didn't talk about any sub-band so far. And by the way, you don't do the overlap on the sub-bands, no? Or you do? Yeah, but you don't do the overlap on the time domain? You said somethi yeah. Okay, so that's the difference. Hmm. P_L_P_s. M_F_C_C_ or triangles? Okay. So you know about this compression, how how does it why it's okay. I just don't know. Ah he's new. He's he's doing you most of the things. So Okay. Well what? I what? I I d yeah. Well the beginning of the Oh yeah. Sure, sure, sure, sure. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So um just they in th um in the speech uh re-synthesis or coding, what you're doing, um did you try to to play with the knobs somewhere. Like uh many uh uh v widths? I m no no. The compression number of bands and lengths of the so what you what you were playing with and what other result? Like what to use so that it sounds the best? Yeah, o of course you you listen to it yourself. I d I'm fine with that. Because Yeah. Okay. But If you go down? I see. So so you won't say that the L_P_C_ is not able to fit it so that the residual was easy? Will be hero. I don't think so. No, no, no, no. are not supposed I think you have to push it push it as much as possible because it reacts to the Yeah. Yeah. Oh which lines? Yeah. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Mm-hmm. I see what you mean. This is the sub-band time signal. It's Yeah. I see. Okay. So Mm-hmm. I see. I was thinking the residual in L_P_C_ fit of the Hilbert envelope, not this. I was not thinking of this at all before, you know. 'Cause there are three things. First you have to encode this, then the L_P_C_ coefficients and the residual after L_P_C_ fit if you like. Oh you don't This is the residual? Yeah. Well i Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That that's nice. Okay. And so so so the so the broader bands do what on this picture? L left left. Hmm. Yeah, that that's Yeah.. Although Herve just said that we shouldn't s talk about confidential things here. That's that's the problem. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh okay. So so there is a compromise between the the lower bands the the worse stuff you just said and and the more bands the more coefficients to transmit. So fifteen is about okay. Okay. So this. And then there is a compression. What about that? So that you get so that you can't model it actually. Yeah. Of what? Oh oh oh, compression. 'Kay. The sub-band signal. Sub-bands power spectrum. L_P_C_. L_ uh L_P_ Yeah. S Well yeah. Yeah, yeah. Go on. Uh Yeah, they are. About three papers. There was uh the s s s SAPA or how it's called, the confere then then And one is in in the America uh yes. Yeah. I I don't know. I just n You were You don't know. Evaluation, that's that's bad. 'Kay. Yeah. Also I can um before Marius left, he he has he had actually left himself. But all the files are here. You know. So all the m MATLAB implementations of these are here. And there is also one big table that he used he used to yeah. He was also playing with all these compression factors and lengths of the of of that. And there is a big table in in Excel which you can look at. Yeah yeah yeah. This wa Uh yeah. Because it it it took a huge amount of time. And he basically he he was the first one to realise that these these guys are pretty slow to to do these things. So he he he just uh he just uh put here the P_ make environment and he didn't stick to any cluster or anything. He just put P_ make and run it on uh on all the machines here. So at some point he was using all the available memory by any mistake, you know. So at th in the morning all the machines were were just stuck. D no one could ever m move the mouse. So these these resul yeah. Because he was doing everything in MATLAB. So it was again ten times more demanding than C_ plus plus and then Mm But he did. He wrote it well. But anyway anyway. Because I w i in the code that I wrote I was like playing also with if if the mat matrix is parse I really don't use it all. I just multiply from here to here from here to here. Not to matrix p my matrix. And then I I just optimised it a bit. And also BLAST libraries and all these sta things. But okay. Oh well whatever. But the t Uh Yeah. Yeah. But there is a the back-end recognizer which I will give you which is turn-around of eighteen minutes or well from eleven to fifteen minutes. Normally it would take hour and a half. Yeah no. No today it was over one hour. It's just like ten times less maybe or five to ten times less. But still still you can you can five times more compute. Great. I have to talk to you about these. I I don't know. I I didn't try to. I didn't even mail to to Chernotsky, I must say. Uh I just talked to one girl there which told me that he would be possibly able to find me a job there. Any any job, like related maybe to field. But job. Not not anything any research. So if if nothing then then I could be able to get the job somewhere. Yeah, probably. Yeah, but t s but yeah. 'Kay. We hope that you find out that everything was wrong and that the potential is much bigger. Yeah, it actually work that too. No. But after you find out the back then it will be that will be the yeah. So we will send you the papers related. And I will point you to all the code which I have. And yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I can play it back. So I can just now tell the the locations of all the files and you can rewind. Yeah, yeah, ferret. Um so Any any more things? Yeah, until twenty four. It's the Friday. So November, yeah. Mm.. Mm-hmm. It was yeah, the last time it was for me it was good, the course from my from one special reason, because in the f when there th were the flats in I lost all my papers from my school. All the all the exercise books. Um how to say this? Note note yeah, all the notepads and everything, all the notes from any courses. So I was remembering what I was learned or what I was taught at the time. So so I have it now back, at least partially. 'Cause all the all the algorithms you were speaking about Yeah. Uh uh I would add Yeah. Now. Mm-hmm. Mm. Oh. some Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and also in the in the l lab labs the d people didn't know anything about it and they just follow the papers. It was Yeah. Uh Not to this topic. Yeah, but anyway after I'm back I'll be still on Skype and all these things, so no problem to contact me until, I don't know, May next year. So it's fine. Well I would like to, yeah. I should. But I would have to study here for that that long time, no? I th Two two years, yeah. And I would have to stay one more. Uh well it would be good reason for Petra that I have to stay here.. Yeah, yeah. Because she has a good position because she has a friend which is starting who is starting a lab there. And everything is it's a great opportunity for her at least. But the problem is and then she will go back and there's uh f family issues and all these things, you know. For a girl it's always the pain. Because she has to break for some time, at least a little. But has to break. And in in the science it's not that easy to to break. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But Yeah, but I think definitely you are the best person here to with uh related to availability of you. Because if if if I want to go to Herve, I probably call secretary. He's there or and when I can and i there was no op uh no ev every time I came to you you were available. At least it That's great. You know the core, which we don't remember anymore programming. We know the details and you know what what is th what is the global stuff. Uh ask Hynek. Ask my boss. Yeah. Yeah. Oh.
So yeah, we put this stuff on so that so that we have some record of the whole thing, what uh are going to say. And uh the whole idea here is says also put the lapel on. Uh the whole idea of this meeting is that it's not me who will be talking all the time. So so that would be a boring that would be definitely boring meeting. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I so the p the actually the reason why we got together is that it's ab it's about the time to A_ make sure that when Petr leaves us uh I'm afraid it may happen, right. I mean it or did you didn't change your mind yet. Or your girlfriend didn't change your mind. So so that whatever he's whatever he's been doing uh is not uh forgotten and then people can stay on his shoulders and uh I hope that he won't get out entirely out of uh out of uh this problem. But still we we need to continue on this. So I think the Joel will be is is my main hope that he's uh he's going to pick up uh the key-word spotting and some of these ideas and also the reason why p uh I p uh uh Petr Motlicek is here is that Joel is also getting interested in uh OPAL models of uh tem temporal envelope. Yeah, and of of course Pet uh Petr for signals. So about it but Petr Motlicek too. Eh both of you you know. So but but but you will be here and from different point of view, eh. Petr Motlicek is working mainly on speech coding. Yeah, and uh so so this is um yeah, I guess this is it. So m I I guess that really you should be talking more than anybody else because you should be asking questions. Yeah. Yeah, I know. So what is it that you need to know. And uh Yeah. Oh this were ho how it started basically because that was uh Marios Athineos, yeah, and Dan Ellis. They had a paper, I believe it was not in ICASSP A_S_R_U_ or something, right. It was a A_S_R_U_ but that was a time when they weren't using very long uh uh uh d uh segments. It was like fifty millisecond or something what they were playing with at the time. Yeah, I know. So then i the story was that then uh Marios presented that at so some meeting and we realised oh, that might be cute thing uh for uh estimating uh spectral energies. Because that's what we want. And we'll the the way we've uh we are doing it is kind of I think it works, but it's little bit inelegant. somehow stupid, so so first do the frame by based uh estimate, and then you you get stick to hundred hertz sampling, ten millisecond sampling or uh something, and then you just pick up the trajectory. So so Marios was here for half a year maybe or even more uh, and uh started work with Petr who also j just came. So they were working little bit together, mainly M Marios was uh programming in MATLAB and Petr was putting it into fancy is yeah and uh but uh and but then we were hoping uh uh uh th to pick up on that little bit more, and we we did, right? You did a little bit of work. Yeah. Hmm. And we never published that anywhere, right? Huh. Yeah. Yeah.. Yeah. We were also doing a serious thing that we were stepping it by ten millisecond, right? At the time. Right. Yeah. Right. That was a reasonable start, yeah. Yeah. So you may be the only one in the whole world now. Because uh because Chi Fong is gone and uh and uh Barry is gone. So Morgan was joking no what he informed me they are gone from ICSI. Uh Chi Fong went to T_I_ and uh and uh uh uh B Barry is at Lawrence Livermore lab. He basically got a job. He he graduated. And he's he'll be working on things which he cannot talk about. He can't even say it on a microphone here I heard. It's uh i yeah, it's classified work typically. It's and so so jo Morgan was h only half joking. He was s somebody was asking him you were or so s or somebody was asking him something. Uh or there was uh there was uh Matthew and he said well, probably we'll be coming to ask you because nobody really knows anymore at ICSI. So please stay. Uh th nobody. That was Barry. And now it's uh cl close histo actually Brno is doing a a lot of that now. They picked up the software and they play with the and nets. So that might be that Brno will be at the soonest as uh a ultimate expert on on the whole thing. N n where which software? No, they ne Quicknet was done uh uh well Quicknet itself was done actually long time ago at ICSI. Is that so? Group? Okay. So we h have to treat him well. Well the whole idea then is that then you start playing with it, right? And you yeah, and Maybe that might be the On frame. Oh. He used to have before he lost all the data. But he will have it again.. Yeah. knows more than than than I do. S so that's good. But certainly when it comes to like uh the the OPAL modelling of temporal trajectories, even pe Petr Fousek is not here, you probably know a lot about it by now. No. That uh uh ap approximating Hilbert envelope by OPAL model. I a v a V_L_P_. Uh as as I say when you when you are not here, that that Petr Motlicek knows enough about it too, because same ap yeah, different uh application, different uh different software or something. If if you make a b broader bands. Because when the band is narrow, the c excitation is close the carrier is close to s sinusoid basically, co-sinusoid. You may almost want to dis uh um i b uh uh uh yeah, uh b use the white-board, I mean uh and uh that's why we have it here, right, so that I don't think so. I think no, we are wired. Except Pulses. This is L_P_. This is a standard time domain L_P_, right? But since you are in a different domain, this is he here we are in time domain, right. But but you are you are really in a frequency domain. So it uh the line's turning to into sines, right. And you p and since this this I mean because this thi this this spectrum is al has also line spectrum, right. I mean all components. So if you are then if we are in a frequency, th your source looks like this. And It's uh yeah, right. So you know that. And this is where And the biggest problem currently is that the carrier is actually not cosine but uh something little bit more uh uh interesting. And if the frequency doesn't change over the wa over over the lengths of the uh Yeah. Yeah. But but f f fortunately, because of he uh because of properties of hearing more or less, for the higher bands you if you put in just s some garbage, some noise, it doesn't really m w matter all that much. It w sounds little bit worse. But uh it's not a big tragedy. Uh where you really w if you want to g do a good voice speech, uh you'll want to get the lower bands correct. And if you put in uh noise altogether, it sounds like a whispered speech, uh but you understand perfect. By noise. So now we have to kill them both. Because I mean gave all the secrets away. I mean Qual computers is going to Yes. If Motorola or Nokia gets hold of this uh tape, then we are in trouble. Uh hopefully it by then it will be protected and and everything, right? It's it's uh it's but listen, this is a science. I mean it's uh confidential to the extent that we are not uh i uh publishing it yet. But we w we of of course we will. And uh and uh but uh we have to make sure that that uh if Qualcomm has a interest of who's funding the work the they have to have a chance to uh to to patent it or something. But that's about all. This is not a public uh public uh presentation. So this i is not even a problem. The only problem would be if but you know, nobody can beat p Petr uh Petr Motlicek anymore in I mean if even if if Nokia knows everything if you if you sell it tomorrow who did you work for th the uh uh text no, t H_P_ H_P_. They will take half a year before they would even realise what it is. And by then so it's not no problem. Okay. So that's where that's uh that's uh To get the uh When you comp uh w what you com when you compress the effectively they'll want the signal which we are modelling. And uh so then you get the fitting to compress signal. Essentially if you were in spectral domain you would compress the power spectrum. Here you compress the the th this th this i the what ful yeah of D_C_T_ of of the signal, right. And so the w then you have uh predictor is fitting actually this compress signal. But you know how much c it was compressed. So you can always expand it back so that you get the c that you get a fit to the to the original thing, except that if it is different. Because uh it ha th basically this OPAL modeling has a different properties. And uh it's So we can tell you a little bit more about it. This is an uh sort of old technique which uh it And it was my thesis even. P_H_D_ thesis actually. A small sorry? Yeah it was S_T_L_P_, was called spectral transform linear prediction. It was my first ICASSP paper ever. It was uh it nineteen eighty three Boston. You guys were still in kindergarten, right? Oh, this is terrible. So But no nobody nobody was using it for anything, except it was cute. But that was about it. And uh and but now it seems like that is since since what we are doing here we are normal L_P_C_ is fitting uh peaks, right. But when you are modeling Hilbert envelope, you don't necessarily want to fit only peaks. You sometimes want to get a basically good estimate of the of the envelope. So that helps you. Because in this uh thi thi this spectral transform allows you to to find the right balance between how well it fits peaks, how how well it fits dips and uh and yeah, and sort of the so this is g so I think that basically I don't know what else I mean you should be asking questions, right. So Yeah. SAPA. And then yeah this is a this they are two papers in uh one is in SAPA, one is in uh U_ Interspeech. uh in a c Cheju. And one was in the A_S_R_U_. It was from Virgin Islands. SAPA was a s I I tell you what it stands for, statistic and ad and something ad and uh perceptual approaches. I was on f I was on a f w s organising committee. I should know. But statistic and uh and something approaches. Uh pe perceptua and statistics and perceptual a approaches. That was uh But they are the same, right, as uh as uh and then also is there is some more work actually can be traced down. I think there wa uh the reading Les Atlas's papers are very good. Because Les Atlas is doing a lot of work on coding in this domain. He doesn't use OPAL model. But he uses D_C_T_ and then he p uh so the so so and it and Les is excellent guy. He's very good mathemat mm h very good theoretician. Basically he's a he's at Stanford the guy. And uh really he likes to write things well. So he's very rigorous uh as opposed to s to me for instance. So if you read that then it then you know that there are no errors and Yeah, uh but um so whatever you g whatever you get hands on from Les Atlas uh for over past five years uh regardi this two years ago, last year on one of the ICASSPs he had like five papers, right. Or various aspects of this because uh he's eager to Is that so? I didn't even see it. Yeah. Or Uh-huh. I don't To fill in, yeah, with all kinds of parameters. He has all kinds of speech recognition results, right. It was the first time you start using the cluster, I remember, or some uh some parallel processing. That was a big thing here. Everybody hated him for t uh temporarily. I remember. Uh-huh.. I yeah, I remember Frank came to me and says is everybody was computing like Marius, we would be all dead. But I say, Frank, but I want everybody to compute like Marius. And Well it is important, you know. Whereas I mean this is something which we never talk about, right. I hear it how much work uh does put in uh here. Because it's true it's true this that uh that things sped up tremendously since I came. I mean uh of course partially because they started to buy some more uh more hardware. But also be p some at least some people basically know how to uh uh write faster programs. Uh this is fantastic. And used to be two days, yeah.. Uh. So do you already know where uh what is the situation with you? You go back to Prague for a while. And then did you get anything in F in France? I got some ideas by the way. I yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Oh it's that's the that's the would be a pity, right. You you ca you t so you don't die of hunger. And so yeah. Yeah, that's not the idea. No. We'll we'll uh we will we'll try something, let's see what we can do. Um So Joel, your main basically thing is as I told you to t uh when we were walking that uh that what whatever Petr did, that it doesn't die, but it i it carries. And obviously uh v we very much hope that you get into that and you get excited and you do s more and uh or uh maybe even different things. But uh That it actually works. It's not that it doesn't work. Uh Yeah. Then And i and this and this is all on the record. So if we uh if uh if we you can hold him to his word. J ju you rewind. Browse through the meeting. Okay. How we doing time-wise? Yeah I think half hour it's fine, right? But you will be here until almost until end of uh Yeah. So breaks my heart. It's just like I was just start teaching and then I n I'll need an assistant. Hmm. Yeah maybe. Uh yeah. Uh d hopefully it's make m makes uh pay pay some extra. So we'll see. Either speech. Uh but it's co actually compilation of uh really compilation of two classes I was giving at O_G_I_, which is like speech processing and and uh perception. And so I tried to put it together so that it makes some sense. No. No. I've it's uh i it I should have at least four. Because this is a p like uh graduates. But I have one, alright. Guaranteed. I have one guaranteed that I don't know if anybody else is uh Uh uh Sorry? I s I don't know. I don't know if it needs to be four credit or not. I don't know how much I like people without uh n not taking it for credit because then they just sit there and having good time. But it's okay. No no, it's okay. Yeah. Guillermo is taking, very good. And so I'll I_S_ who already have at least two. If uh Yeah, we pro I probably get four. And uh it's possible. That's for sure. I mean that's Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, the notes notebooks. Uh-huh.. But that's good, you know. It's uh I didn't get into too many things actually. We know the reason was that at the time we thought I was teaching with Herve. And we thought I we have much more time. And suddenly we ran out of time basically because what happened was that uh it was supposed to be three hour lecture. But it was only two hour lecture. And uh Herve assumed that it's going to run longer. Or I don't know what he assumed. But suddenly we sa s he said well so so where are you. I said well I'm just slowly getting into L_P_C_. He said why but I we have only three more lectures. I have to teach H_M_M_ and everything. So I the L_P_C_ part was like I had to do it in one hour. And then everybody was c totally confused I guess. And Yeah, they were also confused. Yeah. It was at D_B_F_L_, yeah. But Oh we'll see. Okay guys. I think that um this unless somebody has uh still anything incredibly important Right, it's uh ju it's a little bit up to you. You have to p you have to back this uh uh ha h specially Petr. Because just to make sure that and yeah. Yeah. Do you think that you will be done by May? Is it plan? I think so. Yeah, we made a mistake, I tell you,. I think if I had to do it again and we made a mistake we should have register you here at E_P_F_L_. You would have had a degree by now from E_P_F_L_. Yeah, that was a mistake. Sorry yours You were or you were here t you were you were here how long you were here? Two years? Yeah. Where are the Yeah. Right. So is she getting uh uh another position there? Or what is the re reason of What a boyfriend, huh. Oh I see. So that's good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Yeah. Um okay, Otherwise I am also much more available than I was. I mean when you came it was just like cra one of the craziest uh uh times of this year. Uh uh it's not it's not that I was very productive, that I was doing anything useful. But it just like it's a little bit like writing thesis, all the time re-writing and change the do make a little changes and uh uh and Yeah, he's ver no he has many more sp many more people so to take care of. Yeah. Well I'm typically I try to be, because uh because, you know, I mean for s this is also my livelihood, right, students. So I have to make sure that that that uh they need to know something that uh so feel free basically to stop by any time and um yeah and uh it's not that I know everything. But if I know I uh I think I sort of know a little bit like what you guys were doi uh doing, right. But not uh not obvi every detail obviously. Yeah. What yeah, you don't know why why you are doing it anymore. Yeah. Oh boy. Yeah. Oops. Okay, I think my mic is falling falling. So I think we go, huh? Thank you very much. Thanks a lot.
No I'm going to listen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Speech coding. No. Yeah. Yeah well that's uh yeah. So Uh well uh so basically I started reading about the features that's taking the long temporal and uh time frame, that's uh TRAPs. And uh tandem approach. Yeah, s yeah, yeah. So then I also started with the there was a paper on uh fitting a ear model to the D_C_T_ of a signal. Started with that and slowly getting used to the stuff. S Yeah. Uh I think yeah, yeah. It's uh the paper by Dan Ellis and co. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A_S_R_U_. Two thousand four I guess, yeah. Two thousand three, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So for Yeah.. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So then I continued with uh another uh paper that you are mentioning, L_P_ TRAP. So I just moving around with that ideas. And also uh the main idea today why I told maybe is like if you can list down what all things are there to be taken care of. Then one by one. Because finally face find I do have something else. So uh maybe to list down the things other than the what I've already taken from you. And also to discuss generally. Yeah. Yeah. Feature extraction. Part tandem training. 'Kay.. So yeah, right now I have the feature extraction part where I can get the phoneme posteriors and through the neural net. So then I think I need yeah. Yeah, i yeah, but uh yeah, it's T_K_ through for some other task I've run it's T_K_. So I have the general feel. But uh maybe I can take the interceptor from you and run it once on my to have it. Yeah. So Yeah. Basically. So then I can can share what I ca have read and uh Yeah. Yes. So I'll use this. Yeah, the Let's do the feature extraction that we have already taken, then the back-end for that. Then? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh so yeah.. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Traps I know. But though with various? Okay. Length. Ah. Okay. Frame. Okay. Filtering, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay.. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. It's alright. Yeah. Yeah, that's ri Yeah. So compression basically you are looking at I guess, yeah. Mm-hmm. Coding.. Yeah. Okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Mm-hmm. No, that's for compression. I don't need for for compression you basically don't need the. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And P_L_P_. Triangle. Uh yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. The speech signal, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Because Yeah, use maybe you can use the board for that, yeah. Can we remove this when you are going to this place? Oh. Periodic pulse, yeah. But this is uh Yeah. This is like a residual for him. Yeah, in the for uh frequency it is. For any object you measure you use for uh a reconstructed signal and uh Uh-huh. Yeah. H_P_. So what is the compression factor we are getting here? Uh-huh. Okay. Yes.. Mm-hmm. To fit the the Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Coming back though. Yes. Yes. Envelope, yeah. Yeah. Uh one thing I wanted to know is any um a good literature on these lines. Uh where you started with, yeah. Yeah, that's one yeah, o uh th oh. I have two with the Interspeech paper I Pattern? Okay, okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. So Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Yes. Uh yeah. Well, regarding this F_D_L_P_. Yeah, He doesn't send. Yeah. Yes. Yes. So Yeah.. November? Okay. Yes.. Yeah. Bu three I mean four credits? Or uh a total of four. Ah. Yeah. Because s s in I_S_ it's four uh credits and uh Guillermo is taking I think he's g yeah. Notebooks. Mm-hmm. Where was this? In okay. Yeah. But I can come to yeah. Later. Okay. Uh-huh. Yeah. So in case I need something on this F_D_L_P_, I'll come to you? Uh yeah? Okay. Okay. Takes your uh Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yeah, thanks.",IN1007
"So we are here to just make the point. Well make the point, yeah. Make the status about the shot detection. To so you have applied the shot detector to some of the CINETIS video, or at least one, and uh so we can basically maybe just comment on on this, maybe quickly remind what the shot detector is how the shot detector is working, basically. Uh we might be able anyway to give you some reference. I mean your report it's it should be described there or yeah, yeah. You have the report? Okay. To Olivier, yeah. Ah, okay, yes, the kayak wi I was not even with the other one, okay. By the way, I was uh going to ask, so I had seen the video, i you uh did um a downsampling of the video, right? I mean For uh browsing I mean. Okay, yeah. So this is hierarchical normally, so you have scenes and shots, but Because for instance we could probably, you know, like group all the initial ones into one scene and maybe after, when there's some things inside, it s should be another scene, so. Which are extracted I think uh Downsampling. Yeah. Yeah, the quality is that's why I was asking that. It it's not this that you processed, right? Okay, okay. So here we see that we the shot at eighteenth and after twenty twos and after again. And uh if we go down, I mean maybe in terms of shot here, we can see that Right, I mean so now we see shot seven I suppose, yeah. Uh yeah, okay, shot nine currently, shot ten probably. Eleven or twelve. No, eleven. Or no this is ten indeed, okay. Yeah. Yeah, this one, it's eleven, twelve or fourteen seconds. Yeah, okay. Okay. Yeah, it's inside and yeah. It's really a dissolve or is it really like is you have the feeling that it's both Okay. But it's it's it's not standard man-made movies, because I would say most of the time people couldn didn't do any dissolve. Yeah, I could see here, I mean, that it was like horse it was only one single one. N yeah, yeah. This is the one I I had seen, yeah. But as I said, I mean uh with even the motion detector, when it's black it's there is not s no structure, so you don't esti yeah, but you don't really estimate motion. Well, there is no structure. There is no texture, if you want to say so, and this is this is not so good for the motion. Uh but for instance of course between the horse and uh and um the c the c uh uh yeah. Uh the cows, yeah, maybe we could have detected things. But it's not even sure, because the background is quite similar and uh it's it's it's not that sure. So it's yeah. The histogram, so we have experience with it. So it's it's scrambled, so you can scramble the image and you get the same histogram. So there is no structure indeed, so of course when you look the horse and then you can see as a cow the cows, of course you have a black in the top and uh you have also uh maybe eighty percent of like green uh, which is even not green there but uh uh grass. You have stones and uh so there of course are differences, because on the one hand you have horse, but it's black, so you have more sky, which is black on the right, so you don't care about this. So it's a glo it's global it's a global histogram, so yeah. But it's when for this I would for this application I could imagine that it would were quite high. Uh and it's a threshold but still it's adaptive, right, if I remember well, yeah. So. Because of course if you just compute the yeah, if you have the report because if you compute the um distance between the two histograms, I think this was Bhattacharya? Right. So now we know. And uh so if you take uh these two with the with the Bhattacharya uh then of course you should just do a threshold. When there is motion you will see a lot of things changing, so by using an L_R_T_T_ threshold, if you see that there is a continuous change of the d distance, you don't do a threshold. It's only if you have an identified peak, which is m fifty percent or maybe uh two times higher than the the next second value in the window, then you say it's it's a shot. Right, I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's continuous for dissolve, yeah. But an anyway it's difficult, I mean in th in in in general, because sometimes you have some dissolve you could imagine they are part of of of a scene and uh so, but of course when you have cuts you can see they are easy to detect, right, I mean like something yeah. So uh yeah, so with the motion basically the motion tried to estimate well the motion between two frames, right, if my image is there but after it's there, and it looks at how many points c are well matched. So you can see that like somebody speaking and so and so before the sh before the shot you can see that usually there are like ninety percent of the points at least, right, who have some motion, so uh But then after suddenly if you go from one frame and you try to match all the points here with like a translation, plus the zoom plus maybe some rotation, you c you can find anything well, right, so basically you would see that the number of points maybe only ten percent of the points you can match well, so it's easy to detect. And uh after you can see that indeed because it's a long shot and it's almost like a flat plane, you can do a very good registration through the number of points. Is very high, I mean the number of points that are matching. Uh and here you basically here with a histogram uh you can see it very flat, but of course you should go from this histogram to this which is essentially green. You have this big uh measure, which is here uh the chi two I don't know whether this is what you implement is used in the no it's It's Bhattacharya. Okay. Yeah, so yeah, and you have maybe a one image with a um adaptive threshold, I think. You had something like this, right? Just to explain uh how Yeah, uh Yeah, you see like here. Yeah. Alpha times the maximum of the other ones. Of the other ones. So the of course if it's you are not a maximum, you are not going i inside the window you are not the max, anyway you are not going to be to be above uh alpha times the max of the others, right, uh because alpha is low lower than one. Uh. Like for instance yeah. Like for instance here I I see six, but I don't know whether this was for Bhattacharya or for uh chi s chi two. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Two point four, yeah, so it's a bit less because the amplitude is much smaller, yeah. uh yeah. So you can uh it was not so just I mean because the motion I mean it was uh in the shot we've seen, f because f especially with chi two square it r the amplitude it's much bigger than with Bhattacharya, right. Uh you can see that it could go to seven hundred, and when it's there is nothing, it's can be zero. With Bhattacharya it's between zero and one, so you have not so much amplitude. Um but uh still uh in some of the v these videos for instance even if we gon go now if we want to, but now for the kayak case, I don't know. Uh at some point targeting two kayaks and it's moving quite fast towards to other people. I don't know what happened there, if it was detected as a shot transition or Yeah, yeah. It was it as a shot, okay. I was uh wondering yeah yeah, maybe. But here for instance you understand so we can show this tomorrow to uh to the people at the ci CINETIS meeting, I mean to Right. Yeah, okay, yeah, we need a connection, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, I can bring my laptop if necessary, yeah, yeah. I'll I'll bring it, okay, so it's it's done. Well yeah, but normally there is a a burning if you c maybe you can play the shot or It's strange I mean, maybe you play yeah, if you play the the video well, insi at the beginning, I don't know what's happening. Ah, you didn't generate the okay, the Real Media. Okay. Well no, I mean here I can see that it was it was detected as a single shot. Okay. I was because here you can see that the motion uh here is uh, you know, he is uh doing a zoom on the two kayaks here. Yeah, and then he's doing quite a fast transition from these to another one, and I was wondering whether so if you well though of course it's true that it's mainly water, so maybe the colour is indeed uh quite but you know, as a kayak is entering quite fast, I mean you can have quite maybe good distance. But I see that it seems to be how many shots do you have indeed de de detected? Six, yeah, the one is uh maybe so you did it with with what by the way? It's with the images I gave you or okay. Ah, to regenerate an A_V_I_ file, okay, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean initially I don't know why there is a a shot detected. Ah okay, so the okay so the here is an image number. In your programme. Ah okay, okay, yeah. Okay, okay so then this So, but it's in seconds or it's Okay. Okay, yeah, okay, okay, seconds plus number. Okay, so basically what has been uh yeah, extracted is yeah, this point rather than okay, so this is normal, okay. Okay. Okay, like transition, something that is okay. Yeah, it's motion yeah, it's not a cut. Yeah, but I was thinking that maybe it could have been. But it's true that it's mainly water when we see things, so it's, yeah, it's not such a big uh but yeah, sometimes I mean you can have various things hap I mean just think about more action movie and thing like this. Well sometimes it's very difficult, so focus, usually there is no problem, people say this is a cut, this is not a cut, but like for dissolve even sometimes, you know, people may it's people may have some trouble I mean this is a dissolve this is not this should this should be labelled as a transition or not. Some people will say yeah, but it's part of the thing, or uh for instance in like in um also in uh, come on, uh advertising usually. Because the shots are very short in advertising, usually it's uh very fast and so sometimes, yeah, when you have an incrustation like last time, what what should you say, it's it's, yeah, it's a change of But uh Yeah, I mean it's a so sometimes very difficult. A at least what I can see that currently like for CINETIS uh for instance if it's to do colour correction or for instance if it's too black, too a bit whiter, I think this type of things should be fine. Because basically it's even if they are not real shots, they are not so interested if it's not real shot. Maybe after they have this and they may say okay, just by looking at least the summary, so maybe for the summary we could do better uh key frame extraction for instance, but by just looking at the key frames and so on they may say okay, from this shot to this shot we apply like uh specific um colour enhancement algorithm or restoration algorithm or uh to improve uh the brightness and something like this right. And uh so I think for them this is fine um after i yeah. Well, maybe after I mean they would sh okay, uh they would go directly and say select the shots from here to here, and they would say you apply this algorithm, yeah. So of course we could try to make scene clustering and so on, but I'm not even sure that this is necessary for them at this point, because uh if they have a six minute movie, if they have thirty shots, for them it might be easier to look at from here to here I apply this, and they can do it quite quickly. And they have to do it an to do it anyway, because what's going to take time might be uh to select the type of restoration algorithm or the type of things. So this might take more time than having to click two times on two shots rather tha tha than uh having directly a scene, right? So so I think for them uh this type of things is going to be useful uh, at least for this task. If they want to do stabilisation, it may not be sure of that. Uh this is the right segmentation for some of these, but so but this is another point which for motion stabilisation, as I said several time, we are not we did not commit to provide anything, but of course if we can provide things, we'll do it, but uh yeah. So do you have uh more question or uh do you have a Well I just i i i it's I think this is Yeah, but after I mean it may be more like a guy um i int i in an interface, a guy interface. I mean where I mean if second select from shot one to seven, uh this is a same seg they may do the grouping by themselves quite by looking at this it may take w w less one one minutes. And I think it's anyway, if it's too summarised after they may want to go inside uh to see whether there is not special things I mean, so. Uh because after it depends, I mean if you give only one key frame per shot, after I mean it's one hundred seventy images, it's quite fast, right, and so I think and the hierarchical thing is good, because still you can check if you have some ambiguities you are not sure, you could Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, at least yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, ultim ultimately I think this is the type of things, but at this point we uh yeah. I I hope uh that uh if it's a big success uh they will ask IDIAP to to provide something like this of course with some money or at least to pay a student or somebody for doing it, but uh yeah, of course this was ultimately I think one way of uh if you could provide like chapters or something like this, indeed you could provide like the A_V_I_ to the clients, and he may ask for special services or uh and even to just to watch the movie, to have direct access to different parts and so on. But it's uh I mean uh this labelling might be more easy to do for the client by the client, because he knows what they're I mean he we wants to have this and this and uh right, so. Yeah, yeah, he may want to organi yeah, yeah. Otherwise, I mean this but of but of course it might be easy to do a very simple software, which would allow the user to select just the shots and give names, and after it would generate automatically some index and uh as a I suppose the client might be interested in such a such a things if he could uh generate automatically on the D_V_D_. But for and you could imagine that before sending in the D_V_D_, you could allow him to l to watch this type of interface, and he would be able to do the selection, say this is this, this is this, this is this, this is this, and when he would receive the D_V_D_, he would indeed uh get already the chapters that he decided to put there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think this may it it's good that this is a demo like this, because I'm sure that they might be interested indeed, because I imagine that some people Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh yeah, so I think this is uh this is a very good uh and a yeah. But uh So this is a kind of service, I don't know, either they give it for free and uh But uh But you see that sometimes even here it's a bit like uh it's for instance if people would like to have like some motion compensation, uh you i it could be proposed. But for instance here it I wou it would be problematic to have motion. So i here it's fine to do motion compensation, but stabilisation rather than yeah. But For instance here it's it's it's it's Effects? Okay. Ah okay, so maybe like here for instance it is a just reproduced two times uh. Yeah. So this is vi okay. This video is about four minutes, five minutes, right? Ah okay, so this is not the one that has been uh Okay. Okay. It's it's it's real time, right? I mean the processing. Yeah. A bit more than real time? Well anyway, yeah. Yeah, normally it could it could go faster. But i probably it's probable that even for the project you would do some of the reprogramming, I mean to especially if uh we need to interface new uh um yeah, or for just reading, I mean the the D_V_X_ and thing like this, so it's uh uh so tomor anyway for this we don't know exactly yet, because it's not sure what they want to what the user's tools for reading D_V_D_ and so on, so. And s because I don't think this is so difficult, now you have um already looked at the histograms and open C_V_ computing distances and so on. So if we want to do a special thing that probably runs fast, it may be easier to do it directly and uh yeah. But uh but yeah, the interface is very so the interface uses the output of your programme. Essentially, okay. Okay. Mm. You can do the get frame. But otherwise it's not necessary. Oh yeah, no no no. Ye okay. Oh no no, you need you need to generate these images, right? Okay. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah. As a directory, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. X_M_L_, yeah. On the shot. And it's a simple format I suppose, like uh like you have scenes and shots and uh key s some time stamps. Yeah. So but you're yeah. Yeah, I mean it it might be good to And who has a right to put who has a right to put data on the M_M_M_? Okay. Okay, yeah. Yes. Ah, okay, yeah. Yeah, if yo If you have the same uh decomposition right? Yeah. Yeah, but it may happen that uh for ninety fra ninety percent of the frame it's different, so you see it fine, but suddenly you have one other frame, they don't know what it is and where it comes from. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Oh, you mean bac because it's it's it's the M_M_M_ cache? Okay. So this means that when it's done, if I go on my computer and I do the same, it's not going to enter in my cache, but it's going to be already there, in M_M_M_, okay. So it's th it's so it's not done on it's so it's not done online. The first time, yeah, but after it's it take okay. Okay, okay. I thought it was everything was generated on the fly th so Okay. Okay, yeah. Okay, so Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So could you say uh video name CINETIS slash something? Or not? You th okay. You think it would work, okay. Hmm. Mm even if you would r change a C_G_I_ for instance. Let's assume that we say we don't do any scene thing, then we could remove like for instance the scenes, right? I was thinking that here it says that you have online video structure correction. Uh which means that Okay. Yeah. Uh. This is wish wishable uh functions. Okay, to do this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. No, I was thinking No, because I was thinking if it's there, I mean we could use it uh uh we could uh you see but uh yeah. No, no. Fro from outside we can view them. Yeah, from home I was able to access them. No. Okay. Nobody actually it has been downloaded several times and people there are some lawyers that are putting no. But yeah. Y Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, no no, yeah. No. But yeah, it's good to Yeah, if we i yeah. It might be good indeed if we start d building some experiments like this still to have a password. Right, yeah, yeah. Yeah yeah, yeah yeah. Hmm. Yeah, yeah what's, yeah, yeah. Hmm. Yeah, it was done indeed f to be more general than just to do the shot detection, so that's why the code is a bit more complex, I think, currently. Uh but uh Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Just Yeah. Ah okay, yeah yeah. Yeah, it was the same the same ones as the one you saw uh in my code, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah. Yeah, uh okay. Yeah, I think it's it's good, yeah. Okay, that's good, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but why is after, I mean if there is a shot you don't know between because you dropped one frame, you don't know where is the sh uh the d the shot. Sliding window. Yeah, right. Yeah. I don't know, I'm I'm sure that they will be well I hope they will be a of something like this, yeah. The output. Yeah. This generates yeah. Ho how do you generate the Real Media, yeah. Okay. Oh o o, oh yeah, you mean the Java framework, uh what uh Mike presented. We cannot play uh Real Media, okay. Okay. Formats, formats, yeah. Okay, so I think this was good to see the the tool and uh tomorrow we are going to re-say most of the things, but shorter I f I believe, right, I mean it's bad to explain. And I think maybe later w yeah, we we can start doing simple Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, the full uh Yeah, mi this might be interesting to see tomorrow. Of course maybe there was the ah, one hundred seventy shots, or it's a lot, but uh after I mean at this point we do we have nothing we can do unless they know what they want to do with it, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but I think I think is it's too it's going very be very to be very good for them to visualise how you can organise things and maybe what they can do, how they and so this is important. Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah, initially yeah. Well, we didn't because you tried to do something Okay. Yeah, like for instance if we need to find sub-shots, usually it it for instance is better to have the whole shot to decide on how to build the sub-shots. But it's true that maybe I if you store all the distance at that the distances we could do some basic stuff. Okay. Yeah yeah, yeah. Yeah yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's the thing, yeah. Ah, th the gap you mean or no? Oh no, you mean in the Bhattacharya distance. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So. It's okay.

Oh yeah. You don't put your headset microphone? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I have actually yeah, the we can see the report here and the demo, and the goal of uh this meeting is to present the video shot detector to Olivier, okay. Okay. So yeah, it was my project um during my internship at IDIAP under the supervision of Jean-Marc. And as you saw as you saw in the email I sent uh okay. I didn't send this video is the new one. I just um uh processed from your images. Yeah. But uh let's let's start by the video from Friday. CINETIS demo one. Yeah. So this was uh Okay. Yeah, here on the left you have different things, but uh as applied So this detector uh detected the thirty shots, and if you click on uh plus button you can expand it and see the key frames that are in fact uh five extracted frames from the shot. But I think th uh as it is, it's t extracted uh without uh using sub-shots, uh it's simply uh five down-sam yeah, down-sampling. Um so I we can see the video actually, uh the entire video, can open with Real Player. I hope it will work. So we don't have the the sound, and it won't be grabbed the video won't uh I don't know if uh Okay, it's not good quality. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. No no no no no no. It's in Real Media, so it's very compressed. Uh okay. Uh ten yeah. And then there's um Okay. Yes. And this one, yeah, it's a dissolve it's a dissolve, so it doesn't detect yeah, when I saw the M_ with M_ Player, it's a dissolve, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I don't know if this one if we see was correctly uh, you see? Yeah. Yeah. But there is a moon. But okay, because there is no motion in fact between the two shots. Yeah, okay, okay. The cow? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, maybe to explain this method was using uh a simple uh uh distance between uh consecutive histograms, and we didn't use motion features at all for that, that's why i we Yeah, okay. Enough Yeah. Yeah. With a sliding window. I can show you uh Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if we c we want to make uh use the whiteboard or here it's uh it was uh to dis it's infra only the this part about uh shot boundary detection is in French unfortunately, but uh the this image shows the results using motion when you s use the motion features, and here on the right is when using the histogram uh distance. And the the motion features can better show what's going on when there is such a difficult uh transition, while with the histogram um, yeah, it just shows that there is a shot uh change at the end, but even for dissolves, I don't have examples here, but um there is not a strict uh transition. Uh it's continuous for dissolves. Dissolves is uh yeah. Yeah. No no, now it's uh well for the video you saw it wa it's Bhattacharya. Yeah. Okay, set the beginning. So there is the idea is having a sliding window. Um we have already all the data that is on the graph. And then to detect uh the the the the changes, we we do a calculation um with points under this sliding window within this sliding window. And uh we calculate so what do we here? Um In fa we want to detect that uh this points in the middle is higher than uh Th Exactly, yeah. Alpha. Alpha times the maximum of the other ones. The c But if you are in the maximum already and at this point we check simply if uh this value is alpha times the the max of the other points, let's say these points here. Um i maybe for chi it's it six but uh, yeah, but uh for Bhattacharya it's for the tests I did it two point four. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No Mm. Uh i in the the first shot? Yeah, I saw that it was detected as a shot, yeah. You want to see now? Okay. But he didn't okay. It is uh okay. This is IDIAP laptop, so you can u okay. So here in fact after twelve um I don't know if it's I think it's twelve frames. Yeah. Oh yeah, maybe you're burning, but Oh, there is no ha ha. I didn't uh ha I didn't have time to the the Real Media. But um yeah, it's complicated. Yeah, here we can see that, yeah. At two point four. Mm. And then there is translation on the right, yeah. Mm mm mm. I can see uh there is another programme that can see Uh the N_ uh It's I think it's f there there are five normally. If we put expand all Yeah. The other one I had problems converting uh uh the video into D_V_X_, and then uh so I used the programme from uh software from Sebastien, P_ P_A_P_M_ to A_V_I_. Because yeah, one thing uh maybe we will talk about that is the library uh, it's uh it doesn't uh compile anymore on Debian machines and, yeah, some maybe some work has to be done on this. I don't know why this uh image doesn't appear, this is the um um the frame that is uh uh extracted to be the shot key frame here. This one is this one, the middle one. So I don't know what why it doesn't appear, but it just uh a simple problem in the get frame. But what I can show you now is a little programme if we want to be um very precise about so it's ma get frames Okay, C_G_I_ here. And we were interested in around what di do you want? Around six, seven seconds? Okay. Uh if we do next. Oh. Yeah. There is something wrong. So it detects Yeah, in fact, yeah, that's why I said it's it's a frame number. Uh w I don't know why, yeah yeah yeah. It's a frame number. This is a frame number, this is in second, but I I kept the frame number. It's twelve frames, zero seconds. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So if we do every second uh I d the middle frame is uh this one thousand Okay. Do you thi it's another kind of browsing page, but uh to be more precise about uh to to check maybe the this yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah. Anyway, you go back to one frame around f one sixty for instance, I don't know. And and there is yeah, that's it, you know. Prev Okay. You see that there is uh okay, it's not a shot change, it's a motion actually here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I s yeah. Yeah. When you have yeah, the the goal results uh then yeah, in fact it's not a shot change. Yeah. Yeah. So this would ma be made uh manually actually. When you say from this shot to this shot is using a graphical user interface someone who would do manually for each video. Method, yeah. Yeah, mm. Yeah. Ah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm. Okay. This is the one in the D_V_D_? Maybe okay, we can uh see a little bit if you want, to play the Well no, it's okay. Okay, uh in fact I didn't understand that, but now I understand better that CINETIS wants this kind of method to help them to restore and to apply the algori some algorithms to to to make a better movie, okay. It's not for the client, for the user who will uh maybe okay. Okay. Also but okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, uh okay. Okay. Ah, okay, yeah yeah yeah. Because he did the movie, so he wants t okay, to archive, he wants to okay. This is yeah, another mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. And this could be done by through internet. Mm. Mm-hmm. From the client point of view and from the preparation of the movie D_V_D_, mm. Okay, I will play, yeah. We had an arrow here or what? It's Th If I go to menu there is something? Do you know what this is? No, old menu uh there is no menu in the D_V_D_? Okay. Okay. Okay. So this is the same video a the the A_V_I_ number one? And on the on the D_V_D_ I saw that there are some other stuff. I dunno. This one? The same. Okay. Oops. Ah, okay. Uh. There are two files. Okay, I understand. Okay. Run the okay. Um Yeah, almost. I would maybe a less a little bit less than uh a bit more than real time maybe. I will have to check, but if it's five minutes videos, it's like done in yeah, quickly. Okay. Components open C_V_. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Open C_ yeah. Yeah. So that we'll use the whiteboard. So in fact, yeah, the interface is quite is quite simple to use. Um for instance you see um on the uh on the U_R_L_ I put okay, I I disco there is M_M_M_ dot IDIAP dot C_H_ slash V_C_G_I_ bin slash video browser. Okay, uh slash video browser three frames, three frames dot H_T_M_L_. And then this C_G_I_ programme ask the mm parameter C_ video and M_ equals CINETIS okay, demo one. In fact um I just explain how to put the data on M_M_M_, but it's quite simple. When you log into M_M_M_ as with a C_ C_ S_S_H_ for instance, um so you just put it's working like this, M_M_M_ data video browser. Uh okay, slash. And then This is the name of the new directory you will create. Demo one. And there stands there is couple of things well it's uh this name so I will say this is video name, so video name dot A_V_I_, you just because we need the A_V_I_ so that we can uh Yeah, we can do the the get frame Otherwise it's not necessary. Oh, uh f and also for the Yeah, and this is no no no, uh this is done on the fly. With get frame. So you need that, you need uh the X_M_L_ v so it's video name And I could data dot X_M_L_, but in fact it's just a simple convention, I w could have put nothing, but I just put data. The it's a convention. Data, and then video name. Okay, it's R_M_ nine dot R_M_ for other stuff. But in fact, yeah, when I think now, we could have uh Only with uh extension you can you can see. The name is no of in fact yeah, is is yeah. Yeah, is the same as the directory. It could have been video naming also, but it's the same as a directory. And that's it actually. When you you u you do that I did the same for kayak you say kayak in fact now it's kayak, and then you can see. And this output yeah, as your this output uh this file is an output from the mm the software, the shot boundary detection software. It's a very simple format, yeah. Yeah, uh actually we Uh yeah, I don't yeah, we cannot see. It's, yeah, it's uh tha video, scene, shot, it's hierarchical in X_M_L_ and key frame time stamp and the and from the time stamp and the video location he knows how to get the frame. Each of these frames. And if we do in fact I don't know yeah, it's Mozilla Firefox view page source okay, view frame source. And every frame is stored into uh a b a backup in fact every frame um it's M_M_M_ who manage this automatically, so that um when uh you ask for this frame, in fact we can okay, I just view frame source When I view image, when I say view image, when I say view image on this frame, up we go there and this is um in fact it's a Perl programme that outputs in fa instead of outputting H_T_M_L_ or text, it outputs uh J_ PEG. From the video with a time stamp it outputs a J_ PEG. This is quite uh nice. And Yeah. And this image is i this image is output uh outputted to the client. Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah. That's what I did uh here. In the other application, yeah. Yeah, I dunno. Yeah, here. I f there are, yeah, the M_M_M_ developers, so I'm part of that, but uh we could we could uh yeah, it's not a problem. Um I wanted to saw to see to do s say something else. Um oh yeah, and the images are sent to your browser, the client, to this browser, but also kept in uh a directory in uh on M_M_M_. Exactly, a cache. I say backup, but it's a cache. Um that's that's how it works. No no no, it's okay. Um for the cache uh We have plenty of space on M_M_M_, so the this is not a problem ah, yeah for a new window. Yeah, exactly, yeah. And it detects okay. Yeah. So you go inside the get frame function, you see where it i it saves it, and then there is a special naming convention, and you can remove the but i it's c yeah, it's true. No. Because there it's in cache, so that if I put another video with the same name, they th they will happen again. They will uh appear, this frames will appear. Yeah, yeah ex if you have the same decomposition, but But uh yeah, on M_M_M_ f now we don't have such many videos, so. But if you put yeah, in another directory, uh then it would work or or a new naming convention with uh special uh, yeah, code uh. Yeah, M_M_M_ cache. Yeah. But it it can go in the browser cache also. The first time is done online. Yeah, you can see here, yeah. Uh the first time is done o You know, you see that. Well here it's it was cache, because I already pressed preview, but now it's on the fly. So it's quite quick. This. And then if you come yeah. Because the images are already generated. And maybe they are on the cache of this browser, this computer. So okay. That's why it's yeah, it was uh used with uh yeah, Sebastien uh did the C_ function, and uh, yeah, and uh the the is calling this uh C_ uh executable and it was used with M_M_M_ server with Pierre, a and the beginning when, yeah. Um yeah, yeah. Oh, the movies or In fact uh we we we could, you know okay, you know all these graphical user interface that you see uh okay. In fact okay. Mm yes. Yes, we could do that. We could put uh CINETIS slash here, and then a CINETIS slash is the sa yeah, it works. But the uh th the point is this interface is uh I think six or seven files only, X_M_L_ uh well it's per C_G_I_, that output, X_M_L_ and X_S_L_. So it's it's not a big deal to to to make a new, like a CINETIS browser or, you know, video browser. Yeah, we w we copy all the files and there is uh just one um one parameter, one uh string, that we need to know where this data is, and we could pr create a M_M_M_ data video browser uh CINETIS or something else. Y it's uh ex extensible and uh is Yeah. Yeah, exactly, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but i it's not uh it was uh, you know, thi this is working, the expand all but uh this is uh Yeah, to do list or something. On a video annotation, on a video structure co correction. But i it's not easy on the web with H_ H_T_M_L_ pages to to do uh such corrections like uh video structure corrections for instance. For that you need it's possible maybe uh on interfaces like Flash or Java, uh but still uh i i i there is uh it takes bas more work and but i yeah yeah, I mean it's good good point. Well uh you we can make for for instance for T_S_R_ T_S_R_ uh videos. Alessandro uh asked me to do the same thing, and we I put uh we had uh like a password convention. So this is possible to make for these videos. So it's not uh Well if yeah, it is there is no possible productions for these videos. Maybe what I say I'm very tired. But uh if po yeah, it's demo and uh one can say you have to guess the name to but uh yeah. Bu y yeah, a good point uh about password protection issues uh or the privacy issues uh Okay. Uh ha yeah, all the framework is ready with a T_R_S_ T_S_R_ videos, so. Usually what we do sometimes uh okay, just to say something about password protections. Sometimes Instead of having um a purely secure directory we p we we put a co code number like uh so that it's quite impossible to guess instead of video m uh name equals kayak then we would have uh zero six seven uh five or, you know, two. And then this directory from outside we have to take care that okay, not only the video name this U_R_L_ is not accessible, but also we should take care that in fact M_M_M_ it's in M_M_M_ data video browser and this is accessible from outside. We should take care that this directory or in fact this directory is not listable, you know, you cannot list from outside uh with uh F_T_P_ or H_T_T_P_. Yeah, simple things with privacy issues, but uh i there are some methods and everything is possible to make things private. I yeah, I don't know if you want to add anything, but I would say that for the C_ code uh, yeah, I I I just want would like to stress something, is that um, yeah, if you want want to use the new versions, etcetera, I think uh we need to go a little bit through the code and I would be happy to to to help to to for instance the classes about video structure, etcetera, to put them yeah. And Yeah, in fact it's not there is no tosh i it was called vision lib to read uh to to extract one frame each frame of a video, you know. So it wa from Sebastien it was in the tosh library, but uh it's nothing w to do with tosh and it's using uh uh the open C_V_ and uh some classes from uh Jean-Marc uh for, yeah, Bhattacharya distance, etcetera. Image processing. Image processing and stuff. We can forget tosh yeah. Yeah. Um so it's four thirty, so we need one hour, it's it's good. Just if you want yeah. This is the parameters of the of the C_ programme but uh usage. Video in, okay. Uh the output file X_M_L_. Output file dist, it's the distance um between each histogram, so that if the X_M_L_ uh you feel there is not enough um uh shots, you can instead of reprocessing the video, you you reprocess this file. And also some other stuff s for instance alpha threshold we talked about is set to two point four and uh yeah, so the uh the the step we always use one and it should be one, because otherwise it's stuck between consecutive frames. Yeah, but uh it doesn't w yeah, it it's better to to keep it one. Yeah. So detection latency is about the um it's half of the windows tha yeah, sliding window,. Option for key frame extraction, okay. Uh sub-threshold, yeah. Leave it to one, yeah. Uh yeah. Maybe, I I will uh I will give you this file in uh as a rhy it's a kind of rhythmia, yeah. I just for preparing this uh nice discussion. M um I'm quite happy to to to do that i it's good when you do uh something that there is someone using it. But uh but At least, yeah, with the interface it's quite funny to to see um d that the q quickly you can do something in in, yeah, in thirty t if the video i ten is ten minutes, in thirty minutes 'cause it's no not a lot of things to change. Or even it can do it uh it can we can do it quite automatically. It can be done, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah, it So the Real Media is uh, yeah, a parallel thing that from the A_V_I_ you convert it into Real Media, and it is done on Windows. Uh Yeah. Mm there is a a the free one is okay. You can use the free we have a license here at IDIAP, but uh the if you want to pay, you pay for options such as uh resize or cropping, but in fact maybe we don't need that, and uh it's called Elix producer. Yeah, I forgot yeah, yeah uh, Elix producer and and that's it. You can you can i it it i Yes. Yeah. Uh yeah. And yeah, with Real Media Well this is you can buy or you can order for free on internet. No, no no no, for the Real Media. And um you didn't see, but the Re the Real Media um is called via a real server, so it's R_T_S_P_ the connection, and i it's streaming video streaming, so it's not H_T_T_P_. So that it can play uh smoothly and but we are still uh investigating for the video formats, because um i it's not supported for instance uh uh in Java, in Java applications uh etcetera. Real Media. Yeah. Real Media, so there are many issues about that, but yeah. It's another problem. Yeah. Yeah, that was a single video structuring, but it's uh other level uh it can uh it's quite uh it's researched, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, last thing uh this is a kind of uh X_M_L_ that is outputted, so so it's uh the structure is such as uh vi video segmentation with uh videos in begin and then for each shot you have an I_D_ well this is the terms from M_ PEG seven convention, but anyway. Shot begin and end. Uh a sh the shot key frame that is the middle here. Uh sub-shot Yeah, you're right. Twelve frames. And in fact that's what I output in uh on the yeah, I think y on the interface. And there is only one sub-shot because uh w yeah. There was there was problems with detecting the sub-shots, etcetera. But uh yeah well. Yeah, I tr well uh not with this one, but yeah, I tried to code some stuff uh it but uh I'm not so confident in the way uh it is uh coded. Yeah. Yeah. But we yeah, even we should uh for instance for the videos uh for the spectral clustering, for the clustering. Here uh I store the consecutive the distance between consecutive histograms, but we could uh store the matrix that's yeah. And then uh yeah. And I think i there are many possible things with uh spectral clustering, but but the uh with um there is one parameter that is very c wha I can't remember, what is the parameter uh Yeah. No no no no, the in the the gap to find the the good number of clusters is so sensitive uh Yeah, anyway. It's it's a bit later in the in the report. So anytimes, yeah, I would be happy to to to help you with that. Yeah, yeah, you can we can go.
Hmm. Yes. Mm 'kay. Okay, this is. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. 'Kay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Mm. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. 'Kay. Hmm. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I understand. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. We'll see. Okay. see the cut. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Yeah, okay. Okay. Yeah, okay. Okay. I will look to have a connection. Okay. Yeah. And we need a laptop or you have yours? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Uh okay. Yeah. Mm 'kay. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. There was some burning Okay. And the next is eleven seconds and twelve frames. Hmm. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Ah, okay. Understand. Mm 'kay. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay, mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. No. Uh I have look at the demo film, and it's about uh forty minutes and about uh hundred and seventy three different shots, so it's yeah. Yes. And uh I don't know if this is a real sample D_V_D_, because uh this will make about uh five seconds for each shot, so I think it's very short. No? I if this is to r to to to make a change in the colour, light and uh they have a lot of uh shots. Hmm. Yeah, okay. Ah, okay. Yeah, okay. Okay, understand. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Yeah, yes. Yeah. Hmm. Oh. Maybe they can Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yes. Sorry? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah, uh I think I think they made some uh special effect in this D_V_D_. Uh there is two or three time uh you see you see the same uh same kind of uh scene, uh just uh two or three seconds Yeah. Hmm. No, there's no menu. There is just one uh one chapter and no menu. Yeah, yes. Yes. Uh Uh I think in the video there's two there's two video, one is a real video and the other is a just uh introduction when you have the menu. No, it's uh thirteen minutes. No, but yes, this is the same, but uh there was a problem when do the grab from the D_V_D_ to the files. So this is why they have make two two files. But now I have one file also in the so you can process again one time. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. But the the name of the video file is video name is uh it's the same as a directory. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay, yes, okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Okay. Mm. Okay, okay. So every every frame on the f page is uh online. Is is a Okay. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, understand. Yes, okay. Okay. But on the on the on the server the original is a f video film. Okay. So for example you can change you can change a number to take which one, okay. Okay, understand. In the other yeah yeah. Okay, perfect. In this one, okay. Yeah, I think it's not well done, yeah. Yeah. Okay. But um. Yeah. Okay, okay, there is li local cache. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay. So if we for example now we have the c the the case that this video is not correct, because uh I have make uh event grabbing. So uh we need to remove the cache for this video or this is automatic? Yeah. Yeah, but what I mean is i i i i i if I if I put the same video with the same name instead of this one, they should uh different Ah, okay. We need to remove them. Yeah, okay. Okay, understand. Okay. Yeah, it's not a real uh usi usage. Okay. Okay. Yes, understand. Okay. Yeah. Yes, bec because this one i was uh Th this one was Yeah. Right, okay. Okay, but it's okay. It's okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. On the M_M_M_, yeah. Mm. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Oh, it's Greek, but uh okay. Okay, so i if you come back now, you Yeah, yeah. Okay, but now you have s you have both cache. Yeah, okay. Yes, computer too, yes to uh but okay. But it's fast. Okay. Yeah, understand. Okay. Okay. Uh i ju just uh a question on the the organisation of the M_M_M_. So you don't have uh a part for specific uh project. Every for example if we make a lot of uh film uh for CINETIS uh all are on the top I mean uh all the film are y you you don't have a separation for the film for CINETIS or for the project and s Well you say video name equal, all are on the same level. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, okay. Ah. okay. To make Okay. If we need to make some special thing on the browser, it's t Okay. Yeah, okay, it's okay. Okay, great. Okay. Mm. Okay. Work in progress. Yeah. Input. No. Yeah uh. Mm. Yeah, mainly the t webpage or for output. Yeah. Okay. And all these uh file are only uh internal. This mean uh if I go t on uh C CINTETIS CINETIS uh From outside of IDIAP we can access this. With a password or Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yes, okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yes, yeah, okay. Okay. Hmm. Yeah, okay. Uh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I understand, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Right, okay. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Hmm. Okay, yeah. Hmm. Yes. Yeah, okay. And the code is based on open C_V_. Oh okay. Okay. Okay. Bhattacharya okay, and so on, okay. Okay. Okay, okay. So we can forget tosh and uh use uh input se the input reader for the the M_ PEG we can re lo use uh open C_V_. Okay. Okay. Hmm. It's good. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Output, hmm. Uh yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay. Ah, okay. Okay. We can skip some frames. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay, it's perfect. Hmm. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, the the browser. Hmm. Hmm. Yes. Yes. Uh so just uh last question maybe, uh so this makes a X_M_L_ file. Okay. This is the the programme to to generating the X_M_L_ file and the the shot. And uh with the kayak you have one problems, you don't have the Real Media, so this is another thing. Okay. Okay. Okay. So you have some special tools from uh from Real Media. Okay. Hmm. Mm. Okay. Hmm. Hmm, okay, okay. Okay, I heard it. Okay. But uh anyway you need you need to have Windows to make these. So I will ask you or someone else, okay. Okay, okay, understand. Okay. But this is this is made by a programme done outside IDIAP. Okay. This is yes, right, okay. This not uh IDIAP programme. Okay, okay. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Mm. Um. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Mm. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Yes. I think for test I can take the real demo and make the the full processing. So I will Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Mm okay. I have some informations. Okay. And uh in this in this the begin and end the number is the for example the end is zero dot twelve twelve is uh this frame too, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What what Okay. Uh. Okay. Mm. Just what what Hmm. Yeah, okay. Okay. It's okay.",IN1001
"No. Yeah. Okay. I like the timeline. Uh, b Let me see it. Oh, that's the same. Oh. Very good. Um I'm not sure uh if we need the outline of the prototype. I mean what what are we gonna put into that? Yeah, because I mean that's basically what we're doing here, isn't it? The whole Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Um Yeah well, I mean it's up to you if you wanna keep going with that. I'm happy to do some as well. I have lots of time tonight. Um and then uh we'll send it to you and you can do the final revisions. I'm sure I know, you're always online. You always make me feel bad, because uh when I go to bed at like one, you're still online. You never go to bed. Yeah, you pretend. Always busy. Yeah, right. Yeah, so maybe Yeah. So Yeah. Yeah. Oh, there's more. Oh, I see. Oh, this is the one that okay. That's what I thought as well, I mean do we are we are we actually gonna attempt that? I don't think so either, yeah. I think that's gonna be a b we don't even know how to approach that at the moment, I think. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Um um so maybe I mean we we should we should definitely well we could probably not put it under this heading, but put it under changes since the initial specification. And say, you know, we didn't we decided the the r time is too short, whatever. Yes,. Yeah. We would prefer to concentrate on the main And I think we should probably uh comment explicitly on the milestones here as well and say we managed to do M m meet these milestones at Yeah. Like, you know, develop prototype GUI. We t you know, ah yeah we managed that nicely. Uh Yeah, yeah. Yeah, put it put it good. Conceptually. And you can say yeah. We uh say we are still aiming for the development to be complete on the or something. M. Whoa. I yeah, I Yeah, that's right. I I really wanna do it. I mean it's not it's not gonna be difficult. If at least have all the information pop up that is already in the meta-data file. That's gonna be no work at all. So it's definitely gonna be something there. Yeah, it might turn out easier than thought. Um Yeah, sounds good. What else? We should probably d sorry, we should probably do another responsibility of packages as well. That's what he hinted that we should also um indicate who who is responsible for what from now on. Well you could put, you know yeah, I don't know. So um Have you managed any further on the search thing? Alright. That's nice. Yeah yeah yeah. So w is there um did you have you made uh another M_ browser? Is there something that I should Not since you looked at it last, no. But I will tonight, that's the point. No. After the weekend. Weekend was out. Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah. Well at the moment is there at the moment is there a window that comes up? Or is that a r a second results pane? Or is there, you know does the window get larger? What's there kind of what are you thinking? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah. Yeah, I quite like the idea of a tab in that case. But you wouldn't want to compare the result the topic one topic result with one summary result, would you? Actually mm, yeah. Especially if you get if you get results for the same meeting. Maybe yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's true. Yeah. I mean we could we could order them by meeting, for example. How to order it. Yeah well, I mean uh if, you know, that's uh you even a second step, the first question is do we want to order them. How do we wanna order them in the first place. Yeah. Yeah, maybe we should do that. Yeah, m why don't you just um colour-code those. The results to three different colours. No, but if you If you if you do it straight from you know, you get th you get the result, and then there's some if statement saying s straight on the, you know, rock bottom lev level saying if th if you found a segment, then colour it print it in red or whatever, and As opposed to Oh right. Ah. Well, have a look. Oh, mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, I can imagine. Oh, oh, I see, yeah. You you have to use actions. Um yeah, I mean um at the moment it works it works with highlighting in in the transcript window, doesn't it? So What do you mean it should work with anything? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean the whole um the m what fills the transcription box and all of these boxes is a special sort of pane made by NITE. So I am not sure what it's called now. Um Um some Um no, but I know what it's called. And that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well. As I said, you know, if you if you left-click on something for example, it highlights automatically. So maybe it comes with something clever as well. Yeah. No, I'm sure it hasn't got pane in it. NITE I don't know, text text yeah, something like that. Might yep. NOM text there is alright. Yeah, why what's NOM anyway? NITE Oh. Why do you why do we want it in X_M_L_ there? I mean I thought we'd we'd just selectively selectively write the X_M_L_ that we've got. So as as opposed to Yeah t Yeah, only only print out certain um certain segments, the segments that we want just selectively. At the moment it prints out all of them. We'll just put an if loop in it that leaves out some of the print statements. Not not store it at all whatsoever. Because Oh right. Yeah. So what? Yeah, yeah, you don't really need to do much more with it. Yeah, that's right. I don't think it's gonna take long to to produce anyway. It's just another um I mean these meetings are not endlessly long, it's just words, and to print all of them out selectively Yeah. Yeah. Um You could nearly do it together with with uh the transcription with the original transcription, have them run parallel. So if certain, you know if it's a proper word, print it on both both panes, and if it's not a proper word, then print it only on one. But I mean that's that's, you know, fancy, but But um Yeah. Yeah. But then you know, the the b the good way of doing it um not together is that you if someone doesn't wanna look at the the, you know, the chop file, then you don't ever have to produce it.. So But I mean you can, you know, you can write we can write something like um we'll try and do it on the fly and and observe if if that gonna is gonna take too long. If it's gonna take too long, we'll think about writing it to a file and doing it off-line. Yeah, i um. Oh right. Yeah. Hmm. Mm. That's what programming is all about, I'm afraid. Yeah. Maybe. That's the higher people. Well, I mean yeah, why don't you put both of both of those ideas in into that that paragraph and say you'll have a look at both or something, if you wanna do it. I I personally don't wanna mess with uh writing files or anything the moment. I wanna do it superficially. Yeah. Yeah. Well it has already learned it anyway. Yep. Yep. So should we all write um a letter or two about future work as well? A word or two. Oh right. Yeah, well maybe you could Maybe you could split that up and Yeah, like here is what we've done already, and then, you know, down here Mm. Maybe. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Mm yeah, maybe you're right. No. Sounds good. Anything else anyone wants to talk about? We're all half-asleep, aren't we? Burnt out. What. Huh. Maybe asleep. But uh So we're all still writing our um summaries, sending them to you, you send it on to Pernilla. How kind. Yeah. Yeah. And then send it on to us so we can nod. Okay. Sounds good. I haven't used my pen. Oh God.
Okay. Who wants to take notes today? Okay. What? Th okay. Yeah. I'll make funny drawings. Yep. Thank you. Very interesting start of the meeting. Everyone's looking down reading.. Yep. Hmm she never said that. And I'm being like I don't know not a native speaker of English. I think is But what whatever. Oh. We'll see. Yeah. I'll uh look at it like when my usual working hours are like from twelve o'clock till three o'clock or something, so if you can work on it that and then like No, actually not. But I'm never online on the morning. So Yeah. Yep. Well Yeah, do what you wanna do with it first, and then I'll will look at Yeah, uh yeah. And I'll send it out to you again tomorrow or whatever. Yeah. Probably wanna think about if we wanna change our goals and stuff. I think it um one thing that we could probably skip uh totally is the removing things from the audio files. That's no, I don't th that's that's too big, yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah, but that's definitely one thing we could just remove. Yeah. Yeah. I mean we haven't really yeah. Yeah. He he d he doesn't have to know exactly what I mean, yeah m I mean it's hot finished, but it doesn't really say Yeah. Hmm. I don't know. Shall we change the deadlines? Yeah. Should we, I don't know, do you think, Mike, about our things that we had together? Should we I mean now, yeah. I mean we have it now like inverted and you have the other But what about the m Removing disfluencies? Shall we just Yeah, we just keep it together on the the pap there right now and just see what what? No, not the disfluencies. No, haven't. Yeah. Yeah, might be yeah. Yeah. Something Yeah. Yeah, my intent is to work on these things tomorrow a bit more. So also, I don't know if we send it in on the afternoon, maybe I can add a few sentences too when I'm done. Then it's done. And if it's not, Hopefully it won't be. Oh yep. Yeah. Yeah. We'll see. Well, I was still like struggling with Java stuff. But yeah but I'll work on it. Um I think uh I was wondering about that is uh, I haven't looked at it so much, but if m any of you guys know how we could do the like from the uh extract words that you did, like also in uh in this extract t time stamps on stuff, so we can is it Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So now I could just put it in some Tuple or something, yeah. What, on the Okay. Mm. Yeah. I'll take a look at that. Pop-ups. All of them, no. What do you say? Okay. No, we haven't. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah, like Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what and that's what I think we like Okay. I mean, we're not really uh well, I mean we're not gonna do much more than just look at the the rem like the text problem with disfluencies, 'cause we're not gonna search it and we're not gonna like listen to it. Since we're not doing the audio thing. So I guess just to displaying it is a alright. But, well anyway, yeah. No. Well that is true. It's probably best and do as you said. Like just like yeah. No. No. Yeah. I have a friend there too. Yeah. Yeah.. Yeah, maybe asleep. Yeah um What?. I don't know. It doesn't matter for me either. But Yeah. I mean if we both yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And correct back any he like things that I thought was wrong in English or whatever. It like no. That's not that or whatever. Yeah. Oh. It's sad. I write wrote like four lines of whatever. Um yeah, twelve thirty tomorrow with Steve. Yeah. Yeah.
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Basically that's fine, yeah. Yeah, we could because this could be just some uh a little just just describe some screen-shots or something. Yeah, you can either have and we can just ignore that bit. Or you can have Yeah. Yeah, you can either have the Yeah, it says screen-shot there and stuff. But th you can either have screen-shots by the thing, each one, or um have just a bunch of 'em in one session. It doesn't Yeah. I've written the topic segmentation one. Uh it should be alright. Do we d I think Pernilla should do it, yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah, exactly. She's only gonna tell us we got it wrong anyway. So I'm only joking. Th you can you can perfect it and Sleep, sleep, food, sleep. Sabotage it. Yeah. Yeah. Nah. It's a good thing to have, to say we cou what we could have done if we had more time. A good future work thing, isn't it? Stick in the conclusion of the final report. Should if we had more time, this is what we would have done. Yeah. Yeah, if Yeah if We don't think there's enough time. Or we felt there were more important things to do with our time than than worry about Yeah, that's a good idea. You have should have a section probably. The best file on target or something. Or t Well And so I've only got six days to do the topic segmentation as well. Jesus. Yeah. Uh Speaker characterisation. Jesus. Speaker characterisation's supposed to be done already. Yeah, two days ago. Give me a week and I'll tell you the answer to that. Or maybe the speaker characterisation might get slimmer. Probably we won't disappear it, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah, we won't make it disappear, but we might thin it down a bit. Um but we might not, you know, but we might have time. Depends how how how how things m. The topic segmentation with the L_C_ seg and text tiles basically done. It just needs to be done because you know what I mean, the co yeah, tuned, yeah. A search through the parameters or something. Let's see what happens. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah yeah yeah. Certainly. How about the underlying data for it? For the d inverted file. How's that coming along? Yeah. Coming along. Easy, yeah. Just yeah, well it just um when he pulls up the segments um part of that, one of the f one of the attributes you do get attributes. get attributes, it returns a list of attributes. Search through those and and then it just you can that will tell you what attributes it's got. And then you can either do it automatically or you can just hard-code and say, look, get me the time stamps. So you just say um get attribute and put I think it's I think the method's called get attribute and just it's called start time and end time. And that will tell you the start times and end times. I think it returns it double. Yeah, that's on the um the n the the NOM right elements. The the the uh the object is a NOM right element, I think. That should uh tell you what it is. What, have th th uh you confuse me. Do you have um three separate windows for the three separate different types of results? Okay, not not three different okay, okay, cool. Yeah. Okay. Right, yep. Yeah. Yeah. Or tabs or something. Yeah yeah, it's three panes. It's called a NITE text pane or something, isn't it? Is it? Text area or something something like that, yeah. NOM text, yeah. Mostly things are called NOM. Yeah. NITE object model, I think. NITE object model, I think that's what With the um The removing the disfluencies, have you done anything with that yet? Anybody. 'Cause um I was wondering how we're gonna write it back to H_T_M_L_ I mean X_M_L_, if we take if we did the processing. Writing it back to X_M_L_ Seems There's a blop of text. Text file. You will very much limit what you can do with it if it's not in X_M_L_ format. There is some bizarre method that puts things back into X_M_L_ format. But What Oh, select what we want, just take bits of the X_M_L_ and take only it takes certain segments. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Certain segments. Okay, yeah, yeah. Alright. Okay. That It says something different there. That's what Then written to a written to a file. I kinda doubt just that it would ever be done. But that will mean that you can only do things on actually no uh, 'cause you need to do things on word level. So yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Yeah. It's fine. Yeah. Yeah, but it would It would just be blurb like a summary. It won't look like it won't say, speaker X_ says this, speaker Y_ says that, speaker Z_ says this. And Yeah. Then it will look ugly probably, 'cause it will look just black and white. Unless you want as dark colouring. No no, I don't think that's I think it's true. It does it on the fly anyway, didn't it. So So then just goes through it and says if this word equals that then print. Just a bunch of if statements is Yeah, you probably could actually. This is probably and that's probably not that much more difficult. You just fatten the code out a bit. I It would be the same thing. And they can't yeah, exactly. Shouldn't, no. It's just uh they'd just be if statements when they fast if statements, aren't they. This is loads of if statements. Well is that I wouldn't wanna have to put it take to put it back into X_M_L_ with Java. Even trying to read it in X_M_L_ with Java was complicated enough. I gave up doing that completely and just defaulted back to n uh NITE stuff, 'cause it was much much much easier. So if we can do it with NITE stuff, do it with NITE stuff, I think. Otherwise, you're gonna be s Java, trying to do s it was just so complicated it was ridiculous. Don't believe it. You have to d start defining object models like the NITE thing and getting all bizarre w weird things. It was mad. Yeah. I spoke to. Yeah, it's always it's, is it. It's just a it's just a for loop, really. Should be fine, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I included a future work in my own section. But I just said I said what I've done so far and what I'm gonna do, and some pro some issues. I think you lose the You might lose a bit of continuity if you do that, though. That's what I was thinking. But sometimes it's easier to have the top it in its own its sections, if you see what I mean. So you talk about speaker characterisation, you say what you've done and Goals or something. Something bullet pr bullet bullet points. Yeah. Because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing there, if they're not together you lose a lot of the um the continuity, I think. But um So apart from that yeah. Yeah. You stick it together. She'll shine it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. S Steve-O_. Twelve days and write, yeah. Not much without any of us
No. Oh. Channel. Mm 'kay. L I could take notes this time, I guess. I'll takes notes this time, I guess. Actually, I suppose I'll use this. Um actually first thing I just sorta did a really sorta brief um, yeah, version of what we have to do. Um actually I can just take that if you want. Actually for that I was just copying the one straight out of the other documents. So it's all, whatever inaccurate and well But yeah. Okay. Um Oh she has. She has her own. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well, just sorta well the thing is, yeah, we're gonna be touching on all that during the other part for the progress and putting screen-shots and all the rest yeah, exact yeah. Well it's something that he had mentioned in the um in the previous like just to sort of have a prototype together, and so I was just saying that, you know, we could potentially do that. I don't know. It's not something we have to Alter. Yeah, Yeah, sure. Like the thing is I was thinking even in the stuff that I was doing, I mean, just throw the screen-shots in there when you talk about what you're doing, right. It kinda makes sense. So yeah. Oh yes, oh actually I have a I have that at the very end screen-shots. But that didn't show up on this page. So it's not even relevant. So Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, so um so yeah, this just very general structure um, I guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs and and uh. Oh yeah? Cool. I guess. Um so I don't know if there's other stuff that you think should be done to this, I could do that before I mail it to you guys. Um otherwise yeah. Um did someone else wanna throw it togeth Actually I can probably still throw it together if you want, um put your parts into into this one. I'm the perfectionist, right. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good idea. Let's just cut out the middle man, you know. Just yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or you just leave your computer on maybe. Logged in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually I noticed that no one is. Anyways, alright. Okay. So I'll send it off to you. Then um Yep. Okay. Right. Actually d um Yeah. Was there anything else we wanted to add to the time-line? I mean essentially it was what like f um you can't see it right there. Here, I'll s here's the old one. Well, that's that's the orig this the original one. Yeah, yeah, which just copied straight out. Um Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Unless we d unless we discover some sorta time-warp thing, it's not gonna happen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. This, this, and this. Or some of them were later, some were yeah. We could even Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. More or less. Yeah. Search, yeah. P plus plus or minus three days to yeah. Yeah, that's that that's true too. That's true, yeah. Ah that's plenty. You don't have any uh S_P_N_L_P_ assignments, do you? Yeah. Oh really? Oh Jeez. H Um is are one of those something that you wanna change and delete from our list of expectations? Yeah. Okay. Alright. Like should we put i a hint that something like that might happen into the document? Okay. Alright. Okay. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Yeah, true. Yeah. Okay, sounds good. Yeah. Okay. Tuned I guess or yeah. Yeah. Cool. Mm. Okay. Right. Yeah. Well I could probably just copy that straight out of the other one as well. That's essentially the same as it was. Maybe more detailed specifically. Mm. Split those apart? Yeah. I think so, yeah, like, yeah, inverted file. Yeah, exactly. Oh. Well if we're skipping the audio one, and then things got easier. Um Yeah. Yeah. Have you taken any more of a look at it? Have you taken any more of a look at it? At the disfluenc okay. Yeah. Okay. We could probably I know if we'll have time to look at that before tomorrow. We could just make it up. Like I'll claim one, you'll claim the other for the search things, and then we could leave that one as a a joint one. And that'd be good? 'Kay. Um I found finally today something that I can build it in and it uh I should have something for tomorrow. I should uh, you know, at least very least have uh um a GUI and uh wire I'll be wiring that in hopefully tomorrow morning. So I wanna get something I wanna see this, I wanna get it together. Have an image in my mind and I just wanna see it on the thing and then get a nice screen-shot. So Um Mm-hmm. Well. W well well it doesn't really matter, I mean you could write the sentences first as well. I mean with the intention that this is done. I mean and also some sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor too. I mean you write down the words and the ideas as, oh, okay, well I'll do this, I'll do that, you know, it just all falls together. Hmm. Oh. Oh yeah. Um there is, but I w I haven't made a lot of changes to it, so I might just um delete what I've done and copy again from yours. 'Cause I'm sure you've probably made some changes already. Oh really? Since Friday,? Okay. I thought you said okay. Oh right, I see. Okay. I thought you said that you had written some things that maybe have caused some bugs and that you were gonna fix those on the weekend or something. No, okay. Alright. Alright, yeah, okay. Right. Okay, cool. Um yeah, so if you although there's stuff out there that actually I'm gonna try and minimise the amount of changes I make to M_ browser anyways. Shouldn't um shouldn't be an issue. Actually just to clarify last week when we were talking about our search results, um like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as what was the other? Summaries. Um do we want separate result panes uh for each of those? Or do we want them all in one pane with like an icon or a different colour or something to indicate what type of result they are? So that when they, you know, click on that, it's gonna go to the relevant thing. Like just if they check all three say topics, summaries, blah blah blah, have three different windows come up? Or three like sub sub-panes sort of. Um What um I thought what we sorta discussed last week was to have it sort um the same window, um so it'll be on the search window, bottom half of the search window. Um I don't know if we still wanna keep it that way, but that's uh that's what I was gonna be working. So so it's just like you click those and it's just loads up. You know, splits that thing into like two or three or whatever that is. One, two or three, depending on which ones you check. And then um so if we wanna do it that way, you know like it probably doesn't matter too much. Just trying to think if there's gonna be any other issues down the road um depending on No, just just panes, just result panes for each of the three no no no, no No. No, no. So so it's just when we click, you know, topics and summaries for what we wanna search, then it'll uh You know, there'll be two result panes. So for one for topics, one for I don't not really tabs. Um But then you can't see all of them at the same time, and it's just like Well it's no, but the thing is if you're looking if you could check them both um you wanna see all the results. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so the summary and the topic and the transcript are um So Um or we could just put them all into one result pane on that same window and just indicate Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah, I guess that was the other thing whether we wanna have this reorder by columns and all that. But that's a hassle too. It's a lot of work.. Yeah. I think, yeah, probably by meeting makes most sense. I mean essentially they're tem you know, in time order. So yeah, that kinda makes most sense. Least uh Yeah. Yeah. Should be an easy no, I don't know actually. Should be fairly easy, I guess. Yeah. Thinking sometimes in a case like that, like a run across um in other languages, just that it's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally, once it's put into like a list-box or something. It's hard to tell whether it was a a transcript or whatever. And then if we're highlighting something in a transcript window, it may be difficult to get that information back once it's just in a list-box, an item in a list-box. So let's there's yeah. Whereas if it's coming from Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. It's just silly. Yeah. Um yeah, it's just like from past experience I've there's goofy little things that happen, and it just doesn't let you save certain things, and it's just kinda um trying to to do a different kind of to go to a different window. So if you wanna go to the actual highlight the transcript or highlight the topic or highlight the summary. At that point, that's sorta where it starts getting a little bit tricky, 'cause you're working with an event handler within the one panel or list-box or whatever it is. And uh So Um there are ways around it, but you know, whether I'll be able to figure something out like that till before tomorrow yeah, I know. Or delegates or whatever the all that stuff. So Anyways Right. I think so. I think he was saying that as long as we implement that um interface um it should work with anything that we do. Like highlighting the yeah. I think that was um who is saying that? Um wasn't Jonathan saying something about that. I think it was just like as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window, we should be able to have that highlighting happen. I don't know. I don't Anyways Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright. Okay. Okay, maybe I should maybe I should use that as well in my Yeah, okay. Hmm. Yeah, why. Yeah. Okay, that makes sense. Mm. No. Um It's I thought we were just going to have that as words. Like not ev not as X_M_L_, just sort of as a Was that What was that um What transcripts recent oh no, transcript no, 'cause then we need all the other data if we wanna keep it a transcript, right. Yeah. Yeah, that's true, yeah. Good point. Hmm. Oh yeah? Okay, then that's then that's not yeah. Yeah, I know. That's sorta what we were thinking before. Actually, but this makes more sense. Yeah. Yeah, if we're gonna do the X_M_L_, then fine, that's that probably makes it easier. Mm-hmm. As text, you mean? The thing is like well how would we display the like if we do take disfluencies out and just c you know, create a text file, take the disfluencies out of the text file and then yeah. Unless we extract that out of the file when we create the text file. Yeah. That's true too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Or I don't know. I was just thinking as well, I mean we could probably even use like X_S_L_T_ to kinda just transform it and, you know, flip it into uh yeah, just uh transforms um like um style sheet, the um X_M_L_ style sheet. And then it's kinda like there's usually things built in to well should be built into Java, I mean to process X_M_L_ into like in just creates whatever file it's gonna be in. Uh it's been a f couple of years since I've looked into anything like this. But uh that might even be an easier way. And then that way we could even pre-process that before hand. I don't know, do well we don't wanna have to do that, right? Although on the fly it's typic it's it's typically pretty fun. Oh right? Oh really? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Are you serious? It's insane. Actually I was thinking I might try and talk to who is it, Jonathan and Jean? Like just to see h what they what system they used to develop this stuff. 'Cause it would be nice to have all the tools there and just like have the object model and just kind of like plug and play with everything and just to actually use the system, you know, at a higher level rather than kinda, you know, playing around with a little bit of code and modifying their code and doing this and that. It'd be nice to just sorta see what they're doing. So I might uh try and contact them, see if there's, I don't know, any other hints they could give us. Just to get things, I don't know, moving at a higher level I guess. It seems it'd be more interesting to use it as a a real developer would. 'Cause just seems like a little tinkering here and there and just adding couple things and, I don't know. So A channel. N no no, it shouldn't be, no. It should be higher level. It should be conceptual and, you know, coming up with the the brilliant ideas and then just, yeah, bringing those to reality. Yeah. I don't know. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Like the thing that I was thinking there is well is that once it's done for a f you know, one meeting, it's done and it's there. It's file. Text file or X_M_L_ or whatever it is. But yeah, just, I don't know, just it doesn't make any difference really either way to me. It's like hmm if it's fast enough on the fly, then sure. Um that's about the only issue I have with on the fly, whether it's fast enough. Hmm. Especially with Java and all this other crap. it's just if it's loading the file and doing all the rest and processing the p Yeah. Right. Yeah. Whether it runs out of memory. Hmm. Um Yeah yeah. Right. Actually yeah, that makes sense. Um oh like into each separate I know yeah. Yeah, act Okay. I think that does make sense. But maybe at the end, maybe just uh a point form of, you know, things that we're still working on, things that we'll do. Yeah, yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. Yep. Yeah. Actually I'll just Oh that's true. Hmm 'kay. Yeah. Snore. Okay. Or or she'll just take she can take it from now. Doesn't matter. Or do you want to or no? Uh okay I c I can yeah sure, if you wanna send them to me that's fine. Yeah, okay, actually no no n actually that's a good idea, I'll take one quick look over, try and get it as good as I think that we yeah. Okay. Purely a formality. Right. Okay, we're changing dialogue back to hello Jean. No. Okay. Oh. I have. Okay. Oh, oh, right, okay. Well, I thought you had tomorrow off.",EN2002b
"I know. Doesn't look great, does it? Uh-uh. Mm. Yeah there is there's index files already. Yeah. Yeah, in the raw text index directory. Yeah, and it uh allows you to map between the different I_D_s. Yeah, I guess. 'Cause we can't show it in the display. Yeah, they've been cut out the ones that don't have any words. Suppose. Huh. No, I guess not. Hmm. That's just 'cause they would have a blank line in it. Seems a bit stupid. But I can fit 'em back in if Yeah. Yeah, it's a cer uh Yeah, my topic segmenter doesn't like blank lines either. Mm. Oh yeah, cool. Yeah another uh sh issue was that Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh yeah. Huh. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. But yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I don't know if we're gon Do you think we're gonna have time? Is it not is it not only two days anyway? Yeah, that'd probably be quite good. Yeah, I've got a basic search working now. It's g it's got a user interface. So yeah. No. Uh I'm still in my directory, but I I can put it in your directory. Yeah yeah, I've I've not been using that. Yeah. Yeah, I've just been taking the the class files from your directory. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. No one yet. Yeah, that That could be good, yeah. Hmm. Uh. Hmm. Yeah, are we gonna have time to make it display like a whole archive of meetings? Or is it just gonna be displaying single meetings and you'll hold up different ones? Hmm. Yeah, the see, at the moment the dialogue I_D_s just they start at zero for each meeting, they don't run um continuously. But you w you'd like them to run continuously. Yeah, I can change that. Yeah, just to change the index files as well. Mm. Do you want me to put a search in soon? No, oh yeah. Yes. Yeah well, we'll work on it, yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Yes, we're gonna talk about the evaluation next week. Yeah, we could do that. Yeah, I think they're on the N_L_S_S_D_ web page. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, probably as long as we need. But yeah, I don't know. Half an hour or some Yeah, half an hour probably. Hmm. Yeah, I think. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, it may be a good idea to do that. Could we guarantee that it'd work? Hmm. Yeah, I've been able to run it without, yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm sure he'll let us uh test it out before we do it. Yeah Dave, see in the programme manager, do you have a a method to like set the current I_D_ so it'll update the display? 'Cause that's what I'm gonna need when I'm uh like getting search results. Hmm. Right. Yeah, well as far as I've got at the moment, I've made a results class that's got like the I_D_ and the stuff. Yeah. Yep. I'm well, I'm working on it. Right. I yeah, and it might not be there. I know, I was thinking that might be a problem. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. W You could you could when it's when you're doing a search, you could just like sort of zoom back out so you got the full text for that segment or that meeting, rather than a summary. 'Cause that's maybe what you'd want if you were a user. You could provide that option. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Alright. Yeah.
It might be a problem for me at the stage right now because I based everything on not having those um Yeah. Uh what I also Yeah, what I also did was having two people um annotate the first meeting, and so they didn't annotate the n n uh uh the spaces and everything would mess up. I think if I had spaces for the um new values so when I went to do correlation it wouldn't work anymore. So I don't know. Oh what I could do is um work um further with um what I've got now and then just when I have my um um yeah, the final formula ready, I could uh t apply to the new stuff. That would be okay. Um No, my um yeah, what my um T_F_I_D_F_ is based on Colin's data. So um I end up with the same. Yeah. Is it still the old old T_F_I_D_F_? Oh, okay. Hmm. Yeah. I think so too. How about the summarisation again, you wanted to base it on sentence length as well, and I've got a sentence length incorporated into my importance measure at the moment. So Okay. But if we do it twice, it wouldn't make too much sense. Don't know how exactly we will want to implement your We can. Are we still with that idea that we want to display bars for the individual speakers? Okay. And also displaying the speakers before an utterance. Okay. So Toby, you wanted to uh have keywords for each topic segment or something? Um who would uh who uh provides the values for that? No one. Right. Because what I do is um having um values for each segment at the moment. So I could just extract the highest ones for each segment. I don't know if that's good or bad. It could be at least I could provide some value. Uh it it doesn't matter to me. I could do both. Okay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Especially when the segments are really long. Mm.. At least their names, and if we have their names then we can get their email. Mm.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, uh so let's perhaps uh in the meantime talk about the um um numbers we assign to the dialogue acts because um yeah, I didn't know that you left out those who don't have words. So I just extracted the actual dialogue numbers, and the problem is um it's perhaps more um dangerous to get mistaken with all those numbers and not knowing why things happen if we just devote numbers and n make new uh n n Yeah sure, but I mean for all those measures that are based on words um I can automatically just throw those where it's nothing. But um those dialogues acts um like thirty three in in the first meeting, um they have a duration, even though they don't have a word. Um so for my earl other measures I I get them and I don't I mean I would have to look for every single write a programme that looks for everything a number and does the mapping for that. Yes. Why is that? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I just wanted to uh um why do you think it's necessary at all to do that? Yeah, and it's a problem if there's no But actually I think there is something in the audio, shouldn't there? If there's um even though there's not a word, I think in the audio there will be something at that point because it has a duration. Hmm? So d you cut it out. Yeah, I mean but why do you have a special for those? It's just Yeah. Yeah, uh I mean it's just a question I wanted to raise. Oh okay s So um by how did you assign the dialogue act number? Did you take the one you found in the in the um X_M_L_ file and just, know, put it there? Or did you Okay. Okay, you end up with. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No. Who has that going? Yeah. Mm. Presentation is exactly in two weeks. Um uh and re I think we should start to think about evaluation by now. I mean if you want to have some people Yeah, but it's just uh three days between the presentation and the yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think we should ha take the time because I think it will be But we'll also have to write the the thing in that time. I don't know. But it's fifty percent of the mark. No. Yeah. Yeah, it would buy us something. No. Mm-hmm. Uh that really yeah, that makes it really quite difficult for us if we want to test our stuff the first have to fight for our computers without cards. Yeah, sure. I mean I yeah yeah, I I just care for the written one. Does that work without the sound cards? Okay. Okay, yeah. Hmm. Okay, do you want to have a look at the agreement and disagreement data that I worked on last week? Or do we have anything more on this? Yeah. M perhaps my list of agreements. Perhaps my list of agreements somewhere. Yeah, if we find them good enough We wanted to provide um that in an extra list saying probably agreement. Yeah, for example. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. It's a bit small, but I don't know why that is. Hmm. Strange. Yeah, perhaps p because it's wide screen or something. Yeah. But um okay, what you see here um in this part is uh? No mouse, yeah. There it is, yeah. Here is um a list of the uh um most important or, yeah, most probable words that occur in agreement. Um so the number in the first brackets is um so I run it on all the B_E_D_, B_M_R_ and B_R_O_ meetings to learn it. Um so uh the number in the first brackets is how often it occurred in the um utterances that were annotated as agreements by the uh dialogue act agreement. Um and the number in the second brackets is how much it occurred in the rest. And um the first number in every line is um how much more often that is per same um same text length. So um the num uh the words that uh it gives it are look quite good, I think. It's um, yeah, exciting, perfect, true, interesting, exactly, correct, super and so on. Um and then I ran it on the first meeting, getting um the so what's in the in the brackets in this window here is the utterances. Um and the moment it can't make any differences betwe I mean you get the same value for every utterance that is exactly or every utterance that is sure. And um for the longer utterances I just um look how often um one of these words is in there and simply add it up. So that should in principle favour longer utterances. Um and, yeah, and so these numbers here, um one or zero, these here, um that's um um the dialogue act labels whether it's um um if they're annotated as agreement, they're not zero here. So here um for those who get a v that get a very high score, um they're mostly no not zero, and some of those who are zero are o are still very good. Like I I definitely agree um it's a nice kind of agreement that we probably want to have. Um and when you get further down, yeah, you see those with very low prob um score also have um no agreements. Here they are. a lot of zeros. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So it looks quite good, I think. Um so that's what I got for agreement. Then for disagreement I did also, but um it's a bit more difficult because there's so little disagreement. Yeah, so there you s again see the list. But it's much shorter and it's mu much worse. Smilies. Um that is um here at the list of utterances it um gets us for the first meeting. Yeah, I mean I think perhaps that's why we have but uh rated so high here. Or think. I think. Uh yeah. Think is also rated higher in the non-agreement than in the agreement. I mean there is some funny things. Um yes. Yeah, that's effectively what I'm getting here. Yeah, it's just I mean it's it's exactly this thing, but just I would I would just have to re-scale this factor here. And I mean this is the dialogue act number. So Yeah, I can just give it to you in the format you want. So it w it will just k And then score, yeah, it this was just for showing it. Huh? Yeah. Okay. Um one problem I used to have is with all the yeahs. Because I mean obviously they all write it the same. So um I was thinking perhaps at looking um at the um acoustic measures I have. So for example at my F_ zero um deviation. But um yeah, by now I just had a look at the yeah data um and actually the average F_ zero deviation is only slightly higher for the positive ones than for the negative ones. I mean there is a p difference, but it's probably not significant enough to really make use of it. But I perhaps investigate some time still to Yeah. So and I th my my hypothesis was that if it's really yeah, uh like agreement, it will sound different than if it than into if it is just a back-channel. Mm. But that has nothing to do with the threshold. Because you have uh you have um you don't have it only with yeahs. You have it also with words that are much higher ranked. You have the same problem like for example with yep is much higher ranked, because it occurs less often um in the training thing. No. Um it's only if they're used in different contexts. Yes, I b yeah, I know that not every yep is an agreement. Because y um this right, yep and okay things are typically also back-channels. Yeah, but we would throw a lot away that are quite good. If you if you would set it off. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think for this meeting um there were um what was it, like ar around si or ninety annotated agreements or yeah, ag agreement dialogue acts. So I mean the b the best ones are definitely those on the first screen here. So it could just Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Probably have to plot them 'cause some of them are also I mean this is just added by different speakers for example. They are immediately following one another. But it's just two speakers agreeing I think. Same for this one here, for these two here. I mean they they will be optically merged anyway. Yeah, okay. That was just what I I onl only keep uh the stuff I actually need on it and then I clean it up every, you know, every But actually this all here is N_L_S_S_D_ because it was data A_ that didn't fit on my um quota anymore. Okay. Yeah, same thing uh um with the yoohoos and so on. That do not include mm. Okay, then you you will provide a file with all the mappings from the old ones to the unique ones. Mm-hmm, yes. Yeah, but not too detailed. So Um by the way how long um how much time do we have for the presentation? Yeah, but more like twenty minutes or more like an hour? Yeah, I mean if you if you if you present the components of what it it's based on, then you will need more than twenty minutes to present it, I guess. It's question. Yeah, then My computer? Uh it doesn't have Linu Linux. So Mm. Yeah. Yes. And you would otherwise it would be too complicated to cope with the thi uh system if you have to re-adjust it uh to a different zoom level to get better results. I mean it would behave strangely in the eyes of the user.
I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I'm not having crashes at the moment. So what I'm having is so we we had a we had a long problem about not finding out why the time synching up between the relative time in in a in a sort of in a in a summarised section and the absolute time didn't correspond and stuff, and we found it was some stupid well, at the moment our best guess is that it was some stupid Java thing about if you if you actually if you have two objects and you say object if you say A_ equals B_, they actually reference to the same thing. So any changes you make to one are made to the other, and if you do that around five corners, you lose track of it and you suddenly wonder why that value is zero. And it turns out it is zero because it's the same thing that you anyway uh So we figured out it's interesting, why don't I have a screen here now actually that's new, but that's okay. It's doing different things all the time. Like this is the first time that actually the but uh uh that should be okay that should be okay. I'll I'll be able to Yeah, but last time I pressed that key combination, everything went wrong, and I think I'll be able to do it just fine on the screen. So that'll probably keep me from pointing on my screen, which I usually it might just be at this point. Like there's sometimes a point to loading, not usually that long. Well, let's see. Anyway, so n uh let's just see what happens. In the end we did get it working before. Oh see I get Yeah. Yeah. Ah, so now I'm having a complete mess of like split split screens and stuff. I think last time yes, but that's not what we want, is it? So but I think if I this is a log out command and usually it resets this Amazing strange colour combinations I see in front of me at the moment. Yeah, we somehow always get it working, but in different ways every time. Um So that kept us like basically from doing anything else product qu for quite some time in the last days because we were um hunting down that stupid error. I got it fixed in the last whatever one hour or something, but so at the moment the program is sort of in between working and not working because we've done lots of changes to what the error was. Dave, I think actually that the summary at the current moment isn't working a hundred percent correct. But that could be because of the input data. It seems to just take the first utterances more or less. Like if you if you first if you read through the summaries, they read suspiciously fluent, like as in people's questions and answers. And then if you plot them on the screen where where they are at the moment, they seem to o Yes. So maybe that's where the problem is coming from. Yeah. Um So this is when you start shifting around your laptop to think that it gets somehow less sloped on the screen. Um So I'm not really sure what this meeting is about to be honest. Um I'm I'm gonna show this, just what we have at the moment but it not gonna look very different from what we had last time. Don't ask him what happened to the promise that you'll get your script where you can use your own stuff because actually that was sort of ready but then we sort started trying to get something more working and then we got into big problems. So at the moment I mean again we should be at a state where people can load their own sc okay. Yeah. Thing is a at the moment it's just really bad for me. But from Monday on I can just do twenty four seven for this one until it until it's due. But until Monday it's gonna be really bad. Like I can probably help people if they have problems with getting getting what we have running now. But Okay. So I'll just start it up what we have now and then we can talk about what different people have and stuff. Huh? Eek. Yeah, it doesn't. But sometimes you have to take whatever you get and then just see how far that gets you. But would that not happen at some sorry, I'm jum jumping in. Would that not happen at summarisation anyway even if they're in the w like with the ones that have no words and then not have really low information density or something? Hmm. 'Cause you'd reckon that you could leave them in and they would never show up in a summary anyway. We wouldn't you think that if we just write the programme the way that even in the p way that it displays everything, it still leaves those out. Like if we those a special information density I_D_, or if you just put a spe yeah, something like that. And then just make sure that summary even in the in the most summarised mode just never puts them in. Hmm. 'Kay, shall we take a quick look at the current sys Sorry. Yeah, it is actually. It is it is jumping now. Sorry. Yeah, it did s it did summarise just now. It's just it's summarising stupidly, but at least it's jumping. Shall Yes, and in fact at the moment I don't even know which of the two I'm summarising over. Do you know y are w are we um so at the moment the configuration is that word importance file is test three and T_D_I_D_F_ file is test two. I've just I've just switched them around. So I have no clue what we're actually doing at the moment. Yeah, especially since I've just especially s since I've just switched them around anyway. But that's okay. I by the way, I read a paper which makes an important point about combining two things of that type. Um that's basically it's it's t going on about this fancy called geometric mean, which effectively just means multiplying them. But I I have some good f information about different ways how you can sort of weight two different factors, because it's uh like it it's for something very similar. Somebody would try to solve a very similar problem where they also had two factors sort of and they want to weigh them together. And there is like a good justifiable reason um why we should do in a certain way and how we can then with a simple parameter adjust how much one weighs and how much the other weighs. So there is something for just for putting them together in a relatively simple way, but still a way that we can sort of justify. Um and we can quote stuff on that. Yeah sure, we hmm? No, it's multiplying them and and like putting them one over the power of something and the other over minus one one minus the power of something, and that's sort of and they they've plotted some graphs about like where they show f like one going from zero to the one and the other going zero to one and like how the how the landscape changes and how i the parameter changes, how it works. So it's quite good. Um so that's probably seeing that we're probably not gonna go into any whatever base blah blah blah Markov model blah blah blah about f combining them, um that's probably what we go at. Now this is still not ideal at the moment, Dave. It's it's sort of it's overrunning the f like it so okay, so at the moment we're that far that if I now click onto a segment, hits Yeah, it's just wait, sorry, I just re-sized it a bit. Yeah, so it's j like the values are sort of hard-coded for the screen sizes in DICE and my screen's smaller. So let's see, I was a stupid user and was clicking on this segment. We probably have to make the segment lines a lot bigger. So then I h I did I get a new summarisation? Yeah, I didn't actually see. So let me check a different one. Yeah, so you see it's a different text. And you see it it's running through it. And also you see the indicator in where we are is jumping. So it's it's skipping stuff. Now I don't think the summary at the moment is what we wanted to be seeing the words like oh and mm and exactly, exactly, right, sure. This seems probably sh this is again probably the opposite of what we want. So it's probably some value that you have to like divide by one uh one divide by the value of something. But Yes, but also every other word in that sentence we should look at are probably in your list of fifty like list of all important words in the universe. So Yes, but it's probably just because if you look at the other one, like this is just their best sentence for like having function words in a row sort of and every o other I mean this one is sort of the developing a big infrastructure. So maybe it's just doing it randomly at the moment. I don't know. But we have some summary working and that's a good basis to start from. If I promise now that you'll get something where you can put your own data and that's sort of ringing a bit hollow. Yeah. Yeah, uh still it's uh it it's might be having some problem. I think this one over-ran just before. So we might still have some problem here that it's not stopping at the end, but so Dave, can you make the promise even I'm not making the promise realistically that the girls will very soon get Okay, yeah. Yeah. S S so at the moment I've hard-coded it to just um taking one tenth of the number of utterances which were in the original selection. Yeah. It actually it gives you an error if you put it to twenty, because there's some things in there which are shorter than twenty. And if you select those than it's having an Yeah. But I think like a b a proportional one is probably not bad idea, that's bl I mean an an absolute length is sort of a bit strange because that means that some utterances will not be changed in length. I know but we had that discussion before and I'm confused myself about what I think about it. So the fact that this is going on beyond that green line here is something that's not ideal, but that's something we have to sort out. But this is working in general. Does anyone have a general overview over the whole time issue, like as in what date is it today, what date do we have to have this presented, what day of the week is that and issues like that. So the presentation is now sh two weeks from today. 'Kay. One week from today I shall hear the freedom ring from the hills and and everything and shall then throw myself into new slavery. Ah. No really? And the report. Writing the report won't be so bad? How long is it expected to be? I know, but uh if everyone like if everyone is managing three pages for their bit, then that's gonna be that that's a big report then. And stuff. So Yeah, but evaluation. Ah. You think? We should probably inquire about that or like integrate tool tips that would be visible. Having said that, Dave, we could probably w like if we want, we could probably go back to the c um to the group directory and just use this trick. It really seems to be all about starting in the directory. But I mean if if the two of us are just working on it it doesn't make a difference 'cause I've already mounted your directory now. So And probably Mm. What? Well if it's just multiplying to numbers, it can be done in the programme 'cause then we can um because what we could do is have a slide bar where we can adjust this value. Actually if you can figure out a way like how basically a general way because there's at least two points at which we are interested in that. How we can just have a slide bar which we can read and write to, which is in a frame of that type. That would be good. It shouldn't be difficult, should it? I mean should just be Yeah, but it might be more diffi uh let's see, it you could if you're lucky, you probably have just to extend that class and then you can work with that value, but if you're unlucky it might be quicker to just write a very simple string component which is just the s just a bar. Yeah yeah, yeah. So because we'd basically it would be good to have two different ones to play around with, one for controlling the length of the summary, and another one for um for the merging factor, if we do it that way with the CHI metric. Yeah, yeah. It's it's just a single formula effectively, yeah. Um how is the audio thing going? Is that you've probably not had time to work on that. 'Kay, it seems that at the moment a lot of the stuff that has to be done at sort of at the moment I'm saying oh Dave, can you do that. So that's not ideal. Oh. Okay. 'Cause I think I mean the audio is a v in the end the audio is a very important component of it. Just because it's it's gonna look stupid if we have everything working but just if The speech tools. Hmm. Is there any way for X_ forwarding sound? 'Cause that would be sort of the nice way to sit at home and have it forward the sound at the lowest bit rate to you. I mean seeing that it's over broad-band it's forwarding the graphics quite okay, it would probably like broad-band-wise, band-width-wise, probably work out. But it's probably not and uh not a simple thing. Hmm. Y are you not creating files anywhere, like sort of real files? So that you can do on a DICE machine independent of w Yeah. One problem with S_S_H_ ing in general is that the machine that like on the only gateway machines, they hate you for doing anything on them. And there's no simple way, at least I haven't found one to directly in in a single step sort of S_S_H_ and then S_S_H_ again. Well actually I guess if you put S_S_H_ and you know c you can give a command outright after with S_S_H_. So if that c command is S_S_H_ again and if you that would require that you have all your key files set correctly, which I haven't, because it always fucks up on my system. Maybe if you get that working, then you should be able to directly go into another machine. Uh Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause a p a primitive version of the sound to have relatively soon would be good. I think Ok okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, good. So to come back to the problem we had before, so the reason why the summary didn't work well in the last one and works well now is because based on the bottom data the data is so homogeneously high in its imp importance rating that it just sort of then, everything else being equal, it took the first ones more or less. But now it's working better because now it's on a much more evenly distributed Well The most professional way of doing it would be to map them according to the standard deviation 'cause that way it au would automatically always that's sort of like it it's the problem is it's more calculation expensive and slightly more complicated even though it's actually like in terms of calculation it's not much heavier. But like you know generally about standard deviation? Yeah, it's it's a g it's a very simple simple formu it's basically just whatever, the average of r mean square differences from the mean or something, which the problem with it is that generally you first have to get the mean and only t only once you have the mean you know what In one go? Yeah, I've derived that I've derived that myself. Like I didn't find it so I did it myself and it took me a day with the formula. But then I'm slow at maths. So the the good thing about that would be that if you simply say that whatever, one standard deviation below the mean is zero and one standard deviation above the mean is one or two standard deviations or something, then whatever the data is like, it would always normalise. Yeah, it's it's not the simplest. But that like that's the most professional way I can think about it. Y that would indirectly also drop stuff. I mean that would drop whatever is below or above. So if you find that formula, that would be good. Otherwise I can see if I can still understand, like I did it in my programme. It's uh it's really stupid. Like the standard standard deviation formula just requires you to have the mean initially, and that makes some things exactly twice as computationally expensive, and there is a way of doing it cumula cumulatively. Hmm. So yeah, so that's one possible way of doing that. So the And that's just in the loading stage, right? Yeah, that should actually be fine, especially in the worst case we just introduce a small hour glass. But anyway, we only we only gonna present this once and we can probably just like sort of start it up before the presentation starts. So if we shouldn't at all be worried about it's actually it's quite beautiful, it's like if you b want a programme only to run once and only a part of it, you don't worry if it crashes afterwards, if it wastes all the resources, if it formats the hard disk in the end. Anyway, I'm rambling on. Um D No, it does not it does not if y I changed it. I just So You would forget that that means that you would start it fifteen times over and have fifteen zombies running. Um does anyone know anything about which DICE machines have sound cards and how to find them? 'Cause the thing is we can like this at the moment wor is working because it has a sound card. The interesting thing is that because it's structure of this, it isn't enough to just say well if you don't have a sound card, you don't have sound. At least I think that's what I remember our problem was, that Yeah. No. So I've worked around that there is ways I think to get around it, but the problem is So you b you basically we have to we have to have two code versions then, one for sound card and one for non sound card machines to test it on. Um because it you have to change all sorts of other things if you don't have a sound card. So there isn't a simple way to just tell which ones the sound card machines are and just to use sound card machines is there. We No, but I guess I mean if you just if you trust in Dave's summary for the audio, just putting all these things into sound then, then having a written summary Yeah, yeah. So the yeah. Yeah. So I think, Dave, really the easiest way is if you just make a sound card and a non sound card version of it. Because Yeah, but then that means that the girls can't test it. That's the problem. Like Yes, but without the clock you don't have well actually you're right, it doesn't like f it doesn't strictly have to do any movement in it, yeah. Yeah, but we have to comment stuff out for that, I think. Like at the moment if you click on a segment, it automatically sets the whole clock thing going and stuff. So we have to comment out stuff. So that's what I'm saying, that there is we could make it that a flag, couldn't we? We could just make that uh like a run-time flag and then make a few ifs and say if Yes, the p there is. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, so that's something we should probably do in one way or another because it seems just that the overwhelming majority of DICE machines don't have sound card. No, nothing c much to talk about this. So apart from like uh a search box and the similarity thing f once that kicks off, w which is gonna be horrible, but um this is more or less in the end, like this is very similar to what our product will look like in the end, seeing that realistically with the given time frame we're not gonna do amazing new things from now on. So I mean we'll hopefully be able t Huh? List of agreements? Okay, yeah. Okay. Uh yeah, I think it would be good Dave's right. It could be good in the display to annotate them in the display if we can. Yeah, we could just make Not just yet, but that should that's actually that's probably the only I can say I can do this week because that should be I mean I'll do it in an inefficient way. I'll effectively sort of go through all the segments and check if they're clicked on. But I think, Dave, what we should do is that th uh the time click of the clock, I think that's changeable. And I think we should probably increase that. Because at the moment it's zero point one seconds and that's just there is actually there are some background noise when it's working and I think that is because it's like doing so much every time. Yeah, it's probably because you d I'm not sure if you have the version where the display yet, where the display is actually updating up here when it's moving on. So I mean yes, it is because my display is programmed inefficiently. But I think with the t given time constraints it's probably easier instead of making a very efficient display code to just make the time make the clock whatever, zero point five seconds or something. Do you want the monitor? If I can skip more accurately, then Uh you're That's probably because it's coming from my resolution and it's you have a much higher resolution. So Again I think that's probably a good part if we had a slide b um bar initially where we could dynamically adapt the threshold of what we yeah, so maybe it's just like maybe b it's just good to have like some generic component with three slide bars or something where we can relatively easily add a fourth one or something, you know, and just like sort of all our fiddle factors. Um because Uh well it depends, we we could like in some cases we could put it as a feature and say, you know, you can dynamically like We wouldn't call it threshold, we would sort of like the granularity of decision or something like it. So and, yeah, and every and everything above that threshold I could then add the utterance where it occurs, just put a certain graphical item, like a handshake or something cool. Yeah, right. Mm. Yes, I was j it I was just thinking the same, like it's it's so tempting, like we we'll we'll have yellow we'll have yellow smilies and yellow angry faces. Ah, beautiful. Didn't somebody say that actually like a lot of agreements have have actual words which should suggest disagreement like? Yeah. Yeah. If they're corresponding ea for each thing, yeah, they should be right. So for each utterance you have one agreement and one disagreement score. Uh something like it. Okay, yeah. The one where we current Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what, if you can if you introduce um like a sort of a static, what's it called, public static int. So basically a constant like that's Java's type of a constant, and give them names, like so zero T_D_I_D_F_, one that probably makes the code a lot more readable for everybody who's playing around with it. You know you know what I mean? So just like whatever, three means agreement value, and then I'd just write something agreement, and then it's easier to understand for both of us what's going on. Hmm. I would also th yeah but I would also th Yeah. Yeah. But you know what, I think we should put the threshold for that one in the end quite high anyway. So probably it doesn't make much of a difference. Because I think this thing No, but like But I mean the fact that different ones have the same number in itself isn't a problem, is it? So if if for every yep you'd be sure that it's an agreement, than that wouldn't be a problem. So you're saying that you're not sure if every yep is an agreement or Hmm. So over over how many different over which length is this? Now this is like so the third column is the utterance where it occurs, right? Okay, so w I think we really do have to put the threshold quite quite high then, because Yes, 'cause it I was just I was just checking, you know, like how far apart are they, and at the moment that's definitely not a good thing to display if they're like an average ten ten utterances apart or something. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Again, I'd say probably a good way of going about that question is to have a control which we can vary in the dis and then just sort of because that's in the end how it's gonna be evaluated. You know, in the end it this is gonna li I mean we're gonna present it and say yeah, so this our it shows disagreements. And then we see what what looks good and what looks I think probably it looks credible if like an u if every sort of every topic segment has um w yeah, or like or like something in between the three and and five agreements, but not more. Or probably maybe less but not much less and actually the I think there doesn't have to be one in everything. N yes, but maybe in an expensive way or maybe in a stupid looking way though. Um Yeah, d I'm yeah, I was just thinking that it can act it can probably be done on display level. This one crashed. Mine just crashed I think, which is bad. It probably just it kept on playing and now reached some whatever. My God. Yeah. I think sort of the bottom line and which might well end up what it's gonna be like is that we take the single highest ranked utterance and put that as a t as a title, like realistically looking at this from the the time we have left to do this and stuff. There w Yeah? Yeah, maybe even on a s on a sing like i is that on a r like is that on a word basis, would that be single words? Or would that be 'Cause be check out what they would be like on a word basis. Maybe actually if it if there's one word which is very typical, I mean it's probably some word like uh, because that's like the only time that uh was spelled with three A_ and stuff. I think that actually that might be a problem of the whole um annotation that if they aren't exactly consistent in how they descri uh transcribe stuff like that, then we probably can't yeah. 'Cause that's when we're thinking sometimes, like why is mm high. But then probably it's the only time that mm was spelled with a dot at the end and stuff. So But yeah, like if if single w I c I have dictionaries. If it's just like I have arbitrarily long lists from the British National Corpus of when t usually Well let's say at least they do it uh consistently enough that I think you can filter them out fairly well. Yeah, so if you if like I mean if the single ha best one word for a for a segment is interesting, that would be really good. Seem to be having Use a random s 'Kay, we're going backwards here now, it suddenly crashes and hangs. Yeah, I mean that was that was sort of in the original of then, the nice fancy drawings that we gave Steven. I mean that was part of it that sort of within the segment you had these sub-segments and each of them had different words and whatever happened to our dreams? Are there assignments. No, I don't think we have. Yeah. Hmm. Poor man's solution is probably gonna be to have a a list Oh, so j you you are think of loading them all at once. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Even though we 'Kay. Yeah. Yeah, I think that like the dr the drawing has to be changed anyway, the it's not ideal at the moment. Um yeah, so if performance-wise it generally works fine for the display it shouldn't make much of a difference, 'cause I think everything in the display code is just from the first until the last one displayed. So if if the other performance is okay, then we should really just load the whole thing in. I'm very dis See, that probably just means that the display sort of has an internal knowledge about what level of zoom it has. So initially the display Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That's probably fairly simple to do actually if we do it in that most primitive way of just saying as long as you display more than one meeting. Yeah. We then need some way of getting back up again in the hierarchy, but that in the worst case it will just be a static sort of arrow up button in the right hand topper corner of the display, and you press that and then you're on the display the whole thing again. But for that at the moment my display code needs that thing to work, the one oh no, that's working at the moment anyway, the one that I just say give me one hundred values over that length and then you're internally okay, but yeah, but uh that's okay, as long as my display I was just thinking my display can't handle displaying a million different segments. But now r no, but it doesn't have to. Even now it doesn't have to. Okay, well that's all details. Um so Dave, can you just turn this what we have right now in Yeah. Make Uh And if an If anyone feels that they have free time, uh this is a joke, um one thing that would be convenient for all sorts of things and which I haven't found out about it is how to do tool tips in an arbitrary way in in in Swing graphic displays. Now there is simple ways of doing tool tips over a given element, like if you have a button and you just give it a tool tip text. But there is means of doing tool tips that just I c I put my mouse over. Let's say I put my mouse over this line here and then it would tell me something about what it is. And that would be quite convenient for a lot of things because then we can sort of have a lot of information in the display in the in the way that just when the mouse is over it, but I haven't figured out how it works, and that's something that probably so if everyone is ever bored or anyone feels that they can do that Yes, but Yeah, but the the thing is it it isn't simply an act of setting a string default tool tip. There seems to be something about a tool tip object that you have to create and give it all sorts of different properties and stuff or Yeah. So anyway, I haven't looked much into that. So if if anybody looks into that, then let me know. Otherwise I'll start looking into it as soon as I have time again. But if anybody Yeah. I found some stuff about it on the web and it just looked to me like proper coding, like I saw half-page code samples which effectively just displayed a tool tip and I didn't have the time at that point to get deeper into that. So if anybody gets any good samples of that Never. Anyways, that is that it for now? No, but I'm gonna I'm going up Appleton Tower now and I have my external hard disk. So I can Yeah. Is there any DICE machines in this building? Freely accessible for me. Can you show me where because I'm actually not going to Appleton Tower at the moment. So then I don't have to go up and down. Actually no, but I have to go there anyway and put a piece of paper on two machines where some stuff of mine is running on. Yeah, and I think like I'll just I'll just kick in full time for N_L_S_S_D_ next week, 'cause there's nothing I have to do then. Apart from Cognitive Modelling, which I think I'll just do in five hours, three hours. you take a look at that? Hmm. I might just not go for the last question because usually the last question is takes half the time and gives you five percent or something like Okay. Really? Okay. No, maybe he has mentioned it to them, but they just never talked to us. I mean we didn't talk to them. So It's sort of coming as a shock to me now because I was sort of in this mindset. Like I first knew oh, there's a lot of time between the presentation and the report. And then I knew oh, now the presentation is shifted. But the correlation between those two facts, the interdependencies, there's some fancy planning language about that. But that Yes, it's um it's probably some version of the frame problem. Frame plob problem. Hasn't been clear to me. Well, I reckon that it I reckon that probab But if you just present the functionality of the thing, if you're not like I don't think this presentation is about the internal working. So yeah. So for a demo, I think realistically since everything in this university sort of works in one hour slots and stuff. So if it's two groups then it probably it's gonna be roughly half an hour-ish. Hmm? No, why is th this is gonna be so bad. Like there's gonna be some small l Yeah, but the performance is really bad at the moment on that one though. Plus we would have to get the speech tools running on my laptop then, wouldn't we? Mm. Well let's let's see. Did it it could just be fluent on the laptop for all I know. I mean like at the moment it's not too bad apart from I think the sound is stuttering and that's b I think because of the laptop. But we can only really judge that once we have sound files. How fast is yours, Vera? Mm-hmm. Well net would run on anything. But Yes. No, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Virtual Machine should be fine. But but but that all relies on finding some way of getting the speech tools to do their job. Yeah, see that's 'cause that's the thing, like that would rely on I just don't think it's a good idea to run the speech tools in No no no no, d wherever this is going, it doesn't sound good. Um We can he can use my laptop as sort of like as a as a server as a sound server, but that would still mean that we have to get the speech tools running on this. No, you know, I think I mean the way Java works is that t I think it'll run on on their DICE machine if we're doing it in if we well we should definitely test it the day before. Yeah. 'Kay. So Dave, are you gonna make something primitive that people can load their data in? Ok Yeah. Yeah. I'm not I'm not a hundred percent sure what needs to be changed to make it work with the to make it not crash if it doesn't have a sound card. There's there's quite a bit you have to comment out for that, which is stupid because I Yeah the yeah. No, but the thing is the display calls methods which probably expect some so I think if the display itself isn't doing anything clocky, so as long as in the main pr in the programme manager everything clocky is is removed, but uh i w it might be worthwhile to check how much work it would be to do it over a flag, 'cause then in the end i 'cause otherwise we always have two code versions, and people might be changing the wrong one. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's true. I just I know that like if you don't do it with the exceptions, crashes. That's what figured out. Like if you don't have a sound card it crashes, even if you don't use sound. Yeah, okay, cool. Uh I think the display has some method for it. I'm not actually like for the programme manager then to call. I'm not actually a hundred percent sure what it's called, but the display has some method where you tell it where to start and where to end. Yeah or there's gonna be something. Well actually, Dave Da Dave Dave Dave Okay. No sorry, I've uh I was wrong, I was thinking it's exactly the same thing that happens when we say set select no, it does not. But actually a set selection does everything you want sort of. No, but set selection doesn't update the display though, because well it it doesn't tell the display which part to di which part to to display because the display has just called set selection to If Yeah, but that only works that at the moment isn't done through our system, that's just done because then the time changes. So actually a time change would automatically put the position of the display in the right play. Uh no, but that's not a good idea, because that could well be outside the displayed area then. Yeah. So Yeah. No, I think the display has a method for that ready, which is called Anyway, the display has something useful for that. Something which probably starts with the word set. Yeah, you can set the window start utterance and window end utterance. Hmm. Alternatively there's always the method of just giving it a really high score. As a hack, you know, like just as long as you then don't well, probably people wouldn't know. Hmm. Well you could you could put one point one when the other ones only go up to the one. But no, it's it's not it's not a nice way, I'm just saying. Yeah, probably that actually true that if you're doing a search you're usually not interested in a condensed way but in the in the full thing anyway. Yeah. Yeah. I think proportion like I even though I'm I'm always getting myself confused about this, but I think sort of making the summary length thing generally proportion, like as a as a proportional factor of of its original length is a good way of going about it. Because anything with absolute length's sort of stupid because that means that a long long segment gets to one percent of its length and another one gets to exactly the same length and stuff. So if we're doing it by a proportion then just having one point zero or something makes it very easy to always end up at the actually that's what I've currently like the current code just takes a tenth of the summary length. So yeah. And that's the type of slider that we can actually leave in and like show 'cause that's that's functionality. Yeah, that's sort of like your level of the zoom. Of impending doom. Shall we quit here? Anything to be discussed? 'Cause I'm gonna copy that stuff over. Yeah, otherwise you'll you'll definitely see me in M_S_N_. So I'll just
Sixteen times zero. Does it? I have to check that out. Hmm. It depends which data you use as well because um if you use the data where they're all really high, it does prefer ones from the beginning because it just picks the first ones it finds. But I'll check it out anyway. Yeah. I've got time now. Like um for the next couple of days I'll do some on it, 'cause I was just too busy last week. What's that that's creeping over the other screen? That's really weird 'cause it's just started creeping over. Um well as long as the two correspond then it's fine. Oh right, I see. Okay. So would it be would it be easier if there's a reference file with the actual real I_D_ and the corresponding number? So is there some already? So would that solve the problem basically? Because the whole programme works on them being numbered at the moment. Um it'd be a lot of word for really no extra p feature gain at all. Or do you think it could appear in the summary? Well if it's something in the audio that's just like a noise, then we don't want it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't I don't know. You 'cause the thing is it depends if we want to have it display the whole thing at once. If you left them in hopefully it wouldn't affect the way the programme works. Well I don't in the programme, it's just they're not in the raw text files. Well either way. Either way is fine by me as long as the two wo things um tie up. As far as I'm concerned it doesn't really matter whether those are in or out. No, minus one or something. Yeah, certainly possible. Actually yeah, 'cause the T_F_I_D_F_ wouldn't make any sense with So maybe we should just omit them then. Okay, so maybe we should leave them out then. Oh, it's the bar is working now. Oh, so the summary is probably okay 'cause it does the job. Yeah. Oh, I can't remember which one it is at the moment. Yep, that that those names are mislead well the T_F_I_D_F_ is fine, but word importance is completely misleading, it's not word importance at all. Is it very complex or is it r oh, just multiplying together. To a power. Yeah. I've seen that before. Yeah. Yeah, I've seen that before actually. Yeah. Ah, it's still working like it should do. Yeah. So it did work. Yeah, that that is ancient data though. So Having said that, it's picking out some interesting stuff. Like we're looking at atlas, you'd expect to score quite high. Yeah, maybe, but atlas, you'd have thought it'd be quite high. I'm just quite surprised it all actually worked, because I've been working it we've been working on like incomplete versions that haven't worked for a long time, and like to see it all come together. Yeah, I'll do the first thing I'll do is make a load box for selecting a file and a script that sets the class path so it can be run with just a script. So p class path is like this long. But we'll have parameter for that. Yeah. And twenty. Yeah, we need to add some sanity checking in some of the stuff. Yeah. But we don't we don't need it evaluated for the presentation, do we. Is it? Oh, 'cause it was moved back, wasn't it. Yeah. I can rope people in to to doing it, a few people at least. As long as we design it as long as we design it before-hand, uh I think we can probably manage to actually do it in the three days after. You're talking about the user evaluation. We should probably write some user documentation 'cause I bet that will get us marks. Yeah, they'd love that kind of stuff. Just we'll just write, you know, little help files or something. Yeah. Have you Java doc ed it? And also where is it? Okay, 'cause the code version in the group directory is not the right one. Yeah. Okay. In directory, yeah. Okay. Well we should wait till we have it ready for um you guys to use. Then we'll put it back in the group directory. So I'll try and do that today. 'Cause I've got time today. And as long as I don't run into problems I don't see it taking too long. Well in that case it it's probably just I mean that's probably fine. I mean Yeah. I'm not sure how much should be done in the programme because uh I don't know. I think it should probably be done off-line, the basic uh combining of all the factors. Yeah yeah, sure. Hopefully we can take over that right one 'cause we don't need it. That'd be quite nice. I bet you can just uh just add it to the um panel. Like what I bet that's a pre-made Swing component, that little slider, and all you do is add it to a panel. Yeah. Can you send me a link to that paper so that I'll implement that in summarizer. Oh, no I've not looked at it. Yeah, like last week I just not done anything. But can't see it taking long again. But to be honest, I did like nothing really on it last week. So And I've got time today, tomorrow and probably Friday. So Mm-hmm. It's just annoying because I need to do that on a DICE machine. So I can't get them to compile under Windows. Yeah. And um most the DICE machines don't have working sound cards. So No idea. Yeah. I'm not sure how it if it if it can do sound or not. I've no idea. But like what I can do is um I I'm pretty confident that it'll just be writing a script and it will just go. And as long as I can test the script like once and it's working fine, I can just make it return dummy stuff so it works on other machines. Yes. So Oh actually, I know what I can do. I can then I can change the script. So if I'm using my one at home, I can just add S_S_H_ stuff in to ev evoke the sound tools on the uh on DICE and then copy 'em back. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. I'm sure I can figure out some way to do it anyway. If it comes to it, I'll just um install NetBeans and stuff on my Linux machine and work on that. Well that to be honest there won't be a primitive in between stage. just it'll just work hopefully. In theory at least anyway. I wonder if we should um do something like dropping the bottom third, then re-mapping the lowest remaining one to zero and scaling it like that 'cause you get a much nicer distribution like that. Um I've not used it to do that before, but Yeah. There is a way of calculating it um yeah, well calculating it cumulatively, but I can't remember it. Yeah. Yeah, that's probably quite a good idea. Yeah. Yeah, that's probably quite sensible. Yeah, I can't remember it off-hand, but I know there is one. But it could be it could be fine, I mean running over the data twice probably is okay. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, never closes the process when he does it now. They used to not um close the process when you click the cross. Yeah, it refuses to r load the clock for some reason. I don't know why. Yeah, you still you st yeah, you still get the written one and the display. The only thing you don't get is the clock. I don't think we should bother 'cause we'll run it on a sound card version. Th yes they can. All that happens is it refuses to load load the clock. You still get the display in the summary. So the, yeah, the move uh but you can still click on the segments and that'll still work, won't it? Okay. Yeah. Um, oh there must be a way of detecting whether the clock's loaded. Like in fact there there is. You can try and set something on the clock and use try and catch, and then if you catch the exceptions set the flag. We could put those on display. Instead of a list, what about putting it in the display? Can you click on a point in time in display and jump to there yet? Okay. 'Cause that'd be pretty good. No, I don't get that on my machine. No, I don't. No. Okay. As long as you can skip more accurately than the time steps, that's fine. 'Cause otherwise you might risk cutting bits off. Like if you want to jump to a point, you need to be able to jump more accurately than half second. By half second you'll miss words. Yeah, I think so. Oh yeah, I can yeah, I can do that. Of what we display, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Obviously we'll hide that in the presentation. But we don't want I don't think we want to have exposed to the user doing things like adding the threshold of which agreements we display. Decision. Yeah, they uh that does look quite promising, doesn't it. So you can have happy faces and angry faces. Yeah, yeah. That makes sense. So can you um So will that produce basically an agreement and a disagreement score for every dialogue act? So could you put them in the same format as the other data? And I'll make us t to read it in. Oh right, okay. So I could probably I could probably read it from uh that file already. My preferred would be dialogue act number, then you can put both the scores in one file. You can put both the scores in one file if it makes it easier. Yeah. Agreement and one disagreement. So I'll read that into um I'll make it part of the get measure thing. So you can just get it with a flag using get measure. So you know how zero is T_F_I_D_F_. One is um the well I've called it word importance, but that's a really m misleading name. Yeah, probably. Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Uh the problem is yeah is occurring not only as an agreement, but really frequently as like uh an encouragement as well, isn't it. Yeah. How what's the highest um ranked one that that kind of problem occurs with? 'Cause if it's below about 'cause I saw there's ones up in the eighties, wasn't there. If it's below like fifty, it's probably or exactly no they're all but one. 'Cause we on the display we probably take quite high. So it'd only matter if it occurs on ones that are really highly ranked. Yeah. Well otherwise you'd get icons all over the place. So anyway Yeah. So we want probably want to take a threshold at least of fifty or sixty, just as a looking at that. To we probably won't want to display ninety. We'd want to rate them as how important they were, wouldn't we. Yeah. Yeah, and see how it turns out. An agreement at the end. So yeah, we'd probably want to merge ones that were very close into one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and we should probably make some logic when it displays it that says if there's ones very close together, it just centres it among the Yeah, it's looking quite good though. I think it's always really funny that when you look at people's computers who don't use the computer much, their desktop's really tidy, and when you work with people who use it all the time there's stuff everywhere. So mine's like that as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we should um download a dictionary and check our utterances before we uh listen to make sure that they're actually real words. Do you see what I mean? Yeah, I mean see how it turns out. If they look good, then that's a good way of doing it as any, I suppose. Actually, what I think you should do is take the highest three or four and then just merge them together into one utterance. It wouldn't make any sense, but it'd give you an idea of what they're actually talking about, if you see what I mean. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think we're gonna have time for that. Which is a shame 'cause it would've been cool. Um at the moment it doesn't really care how many meetings it's displaying. Just draw a big black line on the borders, I think. Well y you you can if you want to. It's 'Cause it ju it can display from any utterance to any other utterance. It doesn't really Do they? Ah. Yeah, I'd prefer them drawn continuously. Okay. Because that way, all we have to do to display ea more than one meeting is have a harder boundary drawn. One thing we will have to do is we want we'd really want a different behaviour if we clicked on a whole meeting than a segment. So if there's more than one meeting displayed, it should um if you click even on one the segments of that meeting, I think it should re-initialize and display that just that meeting. So I'm not su I'm not sure how easy that would be to do. It just needs to know whether it's displaying more than one whole meeting, doesn't it. That's the only knowledge it would need. But anyway, we can sort that out if we have time once we've got everything else. Yeah. That'll get s s sufficient to claim that we had implemented some kind of zoom as well. Yeah. Yeah, it's not done the very clever way, but it does work. Mm-hmm. Basically do a code for ease on it. Um I'll probably tonight just work on getting a frozen version that works consistently. And um if you could document it for me, that's probably enough for me to add it in. Unless you want to do it. But my code, I've not documented the programme manager class. So though it's a bit hairy at the moment, isn't it. Uh-huh. Okay, so probably what you'd want to do is um detect where the mouse is and change the default tool tip for that component. Because it automatically displays at the correct position when you hover. Yeah, you might nor really want to be creating a new one every time you move the mouse. I'll have a look through some of my Java books 'cause it might be the sort of thing they have in there. Mm. Is there all is that g version all in the Okay. Cool. So I'll start working on that in like half an hour or something and it will be the Okay. We really need to get in contact with the other group and see if they want to do a joint evaluation. So you need to get their email addresses. Are they? That'd be handy. Yeah, we can get them. So you do is sending them an email. 'Cause I was hoping that Steve would mention it Ian 'cause we've mentioned it to him so many times. But he obviously hasn't. Yeah. S there's the frame problem. No, I think it's coming together not bad at the moment actually. Don't know. Yeah. I can't see it going on for an hour to be honest. Yeah, I thought it was a demo basically. Half an hour. And like ten minutes of that would be probably set up time as well. Ten minutes of that will probably be set up time as well. I we maybe you should present it on your laptop 'cause we can be really sure it's running before we come. I could probably get my computer in if I could get someone to give me a lift. I know a couple of people with cars. Yeah, 'cause I wouldn't need to bring a monitor or anything, I'll just need to bring the box. I'm pretty sure I could nick a lift off someone. Or J_ Builder. In fact you won't even you shouldn't even need either as long as you got Java installed. Yeah. Oh crap, I forgot about that. Cygwin maybe? In Cygwin. No, but Cygwin should run um the Java as well. A sound server. Hopefully, yeah. Yep, I'll do that today. And I'll yeah, I'll make a script to run it and put that in the group directory. And I'll send around the email when it's done. It'll be the bit where it creates the clock. Or is there stuff in the display as well? Okay. Well, it really we shouldn't even need a flag. You should be able to do it with exceptions. I mean that's this is kinda not exact case that exceptions are made for really. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh no, it's gonna have to do something a bit more complicated than that. What it will have to do is de-register everything as time handlers and then update and then re-register them. Okay. Have you got a component for displaying lists of matches? 'Cause that'd be pretty useful. Cool. Okay, yeah, I mean it's not it's not too hard to do. All you have to do is de-register everything that's a time handler first before you add the stuff in. But um depends what behaviour we want. Do we want when you click on a search result, we definitely want that one to appear in the summary. Yeah. Yeah, it sets if you look at set select, that's essentially what you wanna do, yeah. Does it not? Yeah, but it w it doesn't matter because um if it's jumped to in the end text area, then your display would the the line'll jump, won't it. Yeah. Uh and also the real time and play time stuff would change. So we, yeah, we need to re-initialize the display then, don't we. Okay. But yeah, we need to do something to ensure that the search result is in the summary that's created. So may we probably want a different summary constructor that takes an an additional argument of an I_D_. And it will that w utterance will always be in the summary. Yeah, I suppose. But the trouble is that still doesn't guarantee that it'll appear because if you get enough of them that are high scored, it prefers the first ones it sees. Yeah, I suppose. Hmm, maybe. But you could d you can um achieve the same effect. Yeah. Probably the way to handle that would be to make a summary that's the same length as the selection, and that would ensure that the search term came up. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But we'll have that slider obviously. Yeah, 'cause that's very useful thing. Yeah. Okay. And I'll start work in say two. Will it be done by then?",EN2001e
"How y how do you do the summary? Is it So are you basing it on certain thresholds uh over a special d uh s okay. Oh that's the old old one. Okay. Okay. Um So you want to send Steve the prototype and we should change data. Where's the best best place to put it? Oh. Do you um take it from from my directory? Or do I have to put in in the sh Yeah, but would you take it from from my directory? Or okay. Maybe that's the problem. Maybe they have got um the minus in the code as well, and then something in is messed up. Uh-huh. And the area could be smaller. Yeah, as soon as I've finished all the meetings I think there's not that much to do unless I get some evaluation method. But that could be quite difficult. I would have to tag uh some part of it or something. Because if I d if I can't evaluate, I can't do any better. Because I don't know how to do better if I don't evaluate anything. Yeah. Yeah, he's really keen on that, isn't he. Mm. I don't know. Ten percent each. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, but it's Um Yeah. Don't know if it's that n yeah, it might be of help. Yeah. It's not essential though, I think. Hmm? Uh yeah, f per utteran uh I print the utterances in the I_D_. Uh no, the the I_D_ of the utterance and uh the measure I think. That shouldn't make too much difference. If I just take well m a file or where one meeting is in or concatenate all those, shouldn't be too bad. Have you currently got continuous I_D_s for your topic segments? Oh okay, I thought you had done all of them and Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Is that what v what you've got, because um because the different meeting series overlap. I think. I don't know. Might be interesting to the user though, just the word importance maybe. But we have got the index um for converting from Vera's I_D_s to to yours. So it shouldn't be a problem, should it. Yeah, I've done that for the correlation as well. So that's what that was quite easy to do. Have you got that for no, it's just for one meeting at the moment. Oh okay, sure. So what kind of change will you impose on the summarisation? Because if we fine-tune uh um according to that and it's not finished, it's n doesn't make any sense. Okay. Right. Uh-huh. Okay. So you at the moment you have got a threshold and everything that's above it is displayed. Or how do you d Yeah, so it's some kind of threshold that is set, okay.
Okay. Did I tell you that we've got kind of two-way interaction? If you control click an utterance, it will play where it should be in the file. We should probably set those sizes 'cause that's such an easy thing to do. Are you missing the sound? Oh, there it is. Yeah. That's Vera's data on the display. But the segments are just made up, aren't they. You can also control click on the dialogue acts and it will play that section of the file as well. Yeah, if you want. Oh that one looks almost com just you need to The original, the very first one. Yeah. Um it will be in program. Where do I call your display? No, it is on your display. Um where it calls which one to get, you just need to change the flag. Um I think it must be, unless I it. Oh no, actually yeah, you can change it for in the summary when the summary gets called in program manager, you can do it. No, not yet. It's just picks the top-ranked ones at the moment. Yeah, the easiest thing is in programme manager, where it makes the summary. It's probably the best place to do it. It'll be above that. It'll be down. It's gonna be after the data manager's made. Yeah, that. A new summary. Yeah, th can't remember where I put it. Maybe it will be in s the summary constructor then. Yeah, try the summaries constructor. Well it reads them into separate arrays and then you can just change a flag to select one i which one it gives back. Yeah, if you want. Uh that should be fine. Yeah, I should make a new constructor that lets you set the flag. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird. On mine it complains about Okay. I think that to be honest is something we can worry about at the end. I mean that's quite trivial to change and we got a lot of other work to do. Yeah, we need to get on that pretty shortly, I think. Okay, so I'll need to do some changes to program manager to be able to handle um changing results. What kind of index? Take and make them in a hash map or something. Certainly for now, yeah. Yeah. Um well from the point of us developing it, it doesn't really make much difference. Um well at the moment it's just a an old file. It'd probably be, yeah, best to make a copy of it. I'd have thought. I don't think I'm gonna be able to do um the speech tools through Java native interface 'cause the documentation for them is horrific. It's really bad. So I think I'm thinking I'll just write out a script and do it with a system call. Not yet. Yeah, the I just don't think it's worth wasting too much time on it. Yeah. Hmm. I don't think it would take that long anyway. Yeah yeah. So yeah, it we just start everything after the summary's been created. It's not a big problem. Yeah. Um I don't think I'll need that really 'cause I'll just dump out a temporary file. I think we should decide what we want it to actually look like in the end. 'Cause are we gonna have some kind of tree view to represent the meetings and stuff? Because if if we're not then we'd probably have to make the graphical display display a bit more information. Mm. It's not too difficult to do and it's sort of a hack kind of way 'cause we can just treat it all as one meeting. But we'll just create like hard segments at the start and end of each meeting. Like ones that are red instead of black or something like that. Mm-hmm. So other than, yeah, other than well we'll just create a hard boundary in between each one so you can see the thing. Yeah. I mean that's quite a cheap way to do it. It might be possible to do it in the summariser. Yeah, it will still appear continuous on the display. So how are we gonna display the search for this corpus? Okay. Okay. How advanced are we gonna have our search? Because I definitely think we should restrict it to I think we should um be able to restrict it to specific speakers and things like that, but nothing too fancy. Oh i uh well, with a speaker I_D_. Yeah, in fact if someone could create a file with the speaker I_D_s and speaker names. that done? Okay. Where is it? Is it in the group directory? Okay. Yeah, it's um the data manager should be quite well documented. So you should be able to use that for the search quite easily. Uh from yeah, on the dialogue act level. I've not got it reading in the topic segments yet. Just 'cause that was lower priority. But yeah, all the you can get all the utterances. So where are gonna put the search results? If we move everything to the right a little bit and make a little bar on the left. Yeah, like the search results in there. Yeah yeah. Like we'll basi Yeah. We'll get something to print out their locations. So we'll arrange it in a nice little order. We Yeah. It's quite easy to do though. So I think we probably should. Uh we should try running that thing again, see what it does now. Or just delete or back-up it. Oh j so I can print obscene messages in the background to um standard output. It doesn't seem to work very well. It's capable of slowing down the audio, but speeding up doesn't seem to work at all. You have to pause it and play it for the. Yeah, that's uh their clock component. Oh, it's all part of the same component that does that. Uh no, we'd have to look in their code and see what it actually does. This thing is really bizarre. It slows it down a bit. The speed up doesn't seem to work. Yeah. Also their grasp of algebra is terrible. Well yeah, it shouldn't be minus two times, it should be half. 'Cause that'd be playing it backwards twice as quickly. Uh it should do, but you've probably gone past the end of the file. I don't know. I think it's just um it did do it. It's that bright selection. Be yeah uh Either that or another Something that might be quite cool is if you could um you know, like some applications, when you open a file, you get like a little preview. If we could do something like that that displays like a five line summary when you you're about to open the file or something like that. Hmm. Yeah. The summariser is quite quick. It could probably do it dynamically. Yeah, it'd look pretty and I'm not convinced you'd get any kind of good quality summary out of it in only five lines. But Another quite good thing might be um how are you do you know how easy it is to apply two tips to things in Java? I've never done it before. 'Cause what would be quite cool is if on this search result, you could give it each one a tool tip that had the context. Like the utterance before, the utterance itself and the utterance after. So that when you hovered over it But yeah, if we can get the tool tip, we should use it though. 'Cause I think it should be quite easy. Yeah, that's what I would have thought. Um it's quite common in like some applications. Yeah. Um all you need to do is just one value. Um the height, it doesn't change in value, does it? So if you just remember the colour that it was last at and you re-draw a line behind it of that colour and then the next one. No, right now it probably won't be that much benefit. Right now it probably won't be much benefit. So this is the component based evaluation he was talking about yesterday, isn't it? Yeah. Oh so that's a bit annoying, 'cause like it's my hope we could just go cobble something together and just say look it's great. Yeah. Yeah. I think they do 'cause that's the first um sixty percent or isn't it? 'Cause it's I thought they were thirty percent each. Only ten percent. I thought they're thirty. Yeah. 'Cause I think we'd rampantly underestimated how long it'd take to do the actual uh software engineering bit. See I'll probably just be starting stuff then 'cause I'll be starting the uh S_N_L_P_ thing and the D_M_ project. What are you doing for your D_M_ project? Oh. Is yeah, I kind of nicked the idea. He went about code M_L_. I'm gonna make one for guitar tablature. Yeah. But I I think it might have been bit off more than I could chew. So I think it's gonna be quite hard. Mm well tab doesn't usually have music notations, just um pitch information. Uh See how far I get anyway. Mm yeah. Well you can easy add a command line parameter. Mm. It may even return a file directly. Possible. Probably. Um the thing is, it I don't know. It doesn't really make sense to call it file open or anything like that 'cause that's it's more like an option. To set the par. Because it reads everything just from one file. Mm-hmm. Oh yeah, that did happen once before. Or even just the entire corpus. That's what um Colin's file has got. Does his? It's it's easy to load that much just text. Uh I think it makes more sense to go for the whole corpus because the meet the um the I_D_s gonna have gaps and stuff in them otherwise. And it means you have to read through the list of utterances when you're compiling all the data over and over and over and over again. Yeah. Yeah. Well a at the moment the main data i that's just uh uniquely numbered throughout the entire corpus. Well at the moment from the dump file, it's just got them uniquely numbered throughout the entire corpus. Hmm. And it makes more sense to do that anyway because um that means you got more flexibility with how you want to group them. And one thing you really don't want is ever to have two utterances that could potentially have the same I_D_. Yeah, but that's the point of the data manager is to manage all that. It's possible, but it's it's not really much point. 'Cause at the moment it's got quite nice property that the dialogue act number also coincides with the array index number in the array of dialogue acts, which is quite nice. Well you could you could choose whatever you wanted. But you may not be interested in the same series each time. You might want to display all meetings that had a particular phrase mention, say. And those might not be the ones that we enumerated as one meeting, in which case you're gonna have conflicting I_D_s and things like that. Whereas the da if you do it in the data manager, you can control any logic like that programmatically rather than doing it by hand and setting it in stone for all time. Well it's just good practice. Like it separates the data from the programme logic. What you're talking about doing is embedding some of the programme logic in the data. Yeah, but that's a decision we're forcing on the user when we don't have to. Yeah, I don't see why not. Yeah. I think it sh everything should be like that, continuous in chronological order. I'm not sure, I haven't really looked at the data. If there's no value, I guess you have to put a zero in. Yeah. Well it might be more sensible to assign it an average value. Well we'd w only use F_ zero when it was present though, wouldn't we? We well we'd want to use F_ zero when it's present. Yeah. Yeah, in the summariser it'd be the uh ideal place to do that. You could use um red green and blue to display up to three. Well, I don't know how to do it in Java. But The trouble is that hue isn't a very sensible scale. Like it comes up to like red two or three times and stuff like that. Or you could just split it into two blocks, I suppose, for now. Yeah. Well there's no reason why it can't swap meetings at the moment if the data's there for it. Yeah, that's most sensible way to do it, I think. Yeah, that's well, it's not reading that in yet, but that will be part of the data manager as well. Like there's access classes all defined for that. Yeah, it's in your file, isn't it? 'Cause each utterance has got an I_D_ associated with it. I don't know. So just keep yeah, just enumerate up for the next number. Three. Well that's what I meant is it's a bit pointless having it as file open 'cause it will be opening those files all the time. It's more sensible to have it as an option and the location of them. Or just so you can configure the the location of all the files as an option. But when it starts up it should just read them from the default place. Yeah, that makes sense. Oh, of course t there's no reason why we can't make a development version that displays both, has two win utterance windows and uh two graphical displays. I mean obviously you it'd have to pick which one to synch the clock to. To add another dialogue act window is really easy. Oh like say if you could make a um change to your thing so it could display uh like it in two halves. So like the top half one, the bottom half the other. Or maybe three actually. Maybe top half one, bottom half the other and the third one an average that we can change the parameters for. And then yeah, I could easily make it throw out three different dialogue acts. No, I'd just have two of them not synched up because it's just for evaluating the data. Oh right, yeah, I see what you mean. Oh no, no, it's still good, because um Oh no, it isn't. Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah. Yeah, I suppose. No, hold on, you it wouldn't need three internal time scales, 'cause only one's synched to the clock or it c and the others are all absolute real time, aren't they. That's what's displayed on that, the bar, is real time, isn't it. So they would all be in the same time scale. No no, only one of them synchs, and two of them are just yeah. 'Cause it doesn't really matter. They synch up for the purpose of evaluating the data. Yeah. I mean not in the final version, just for now. Yeah. How easy would it be to make it so you can add arbitrary numbers of them do you think? No, like uh different measures to the display. Well that's the thing, if it's gonna take more than like an hour or something, it's not worth it. Yeah. Mm. But that's easy 'cause mine can take uh any number of parameters. Mine, I'll need to make a minor addition to the data manager and the summariser. But it's more or less ready to go with that. Okay. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah, should be easy. We could just make that rate be something completely different, just disconnect it from whatever it's doing, and then have that set the length of the summary or something like that. Mm. Well it doesn't it doesn't react to it being changed automatically. It only reacts when you press play at the moment. So you have to stop it and start it to make any effect. Mm. Yeah, I mean just disconnect it from whatever it sends the media player and connect it up to our summarisers. That makes different length summaries. 'Cause like we could make that not even have like a a real sort of meaning, just put like max and min. And the user can just like set it in-between wherever they want the uh without actually telling them what it actually means if you see what I mean. Yeah. We should certainly take away the labels that say minus four times as well. 'Cause that's incredibly unintuitive. Well But it won't make any huge changes, like it'll always have the ef the ability to read the original ones. But it might be quite cool to have a combined measure. Like just a weighted average is probably the most sensible way to about it and possibly thresholding it. No, it just takes the top like twenty or fifty or however many. Yeah. Um well I was gonna go to the gym at about three. So Or to be honest, like it's much quicker for me to get stuff done on my own. It'd make more sense for us to divide up spend a couple of hours dividing up tasks and then do them separately. Well it'll be after four then. 'Cause I'm gonna go at three. The gym. Okay. So meet say five till seven, that should be enough time. Because yeah, it's much quicker if we're both working separately, I think. 'Cause when we've been working together like I've just not got a lot done. And like when I go home I'll spend like the same amount of time and get loads done if you see what I mean. Yeah, okay. Okay. So you're gonna be up there as well then?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. No, I'm just like sort of like preparing people for um it looks like it looks like really nothing. It looks like basically less than n th their stuff, but actually Dave has written a whole underlying different structure now and if we hooked it up with my display, then we should fairly easily from now get to a stage where we can like select individual segments and click on them, then play that part in a compressed way and display density information. Now at the moment the application is Yes, sure but so at the moment we have a dialogue act window and a graphical display w I'm not sure. No, the interesting thing is the sound came when I tried it last time after I I triggered off something by clicking on something. Yeah, there suddenly they come. Probably they're just slow at loading. And they don't have the buttons yet. So at the moment the display is still dis-coupled from it. It's loading your data I'm not quite sure, is this it probably looks like Vera's data from from the looks of it. Yeah, the segments are made up at the moment, but the code's there for integrating real segments. And this is summarised based on just Vera's data at the moment, from some part of the meeting. So we're we're not loading the whole thing at the moment yet properly. But the important thing is this is summarised based on I I realise I'm always pointing at my screen and you don't see. So this stuff is summarised based on on these intensity measures. And we don't have the exact audio record for this. Usually say we should have just copied it. So just to show, Dave has put a uh music file in there, and the music file is playing without gaps. That's because the way how we handle it at the moment is that Dave prepares an audio file, creates an audio file dynamically from just the chunks that we wanna have, and that runs in synch with what we have in the I'm not even sure why I'm making loud. It's just So we see that running along with playing of the music we see the the highlight of the dialogue acts. Okay, s So and and that already this part here already is dynamically created. Um shall I just load it with Jasmine's data, just to see a different Where's the Quite old. Yeah, we were b like doing this, we were just concerned with the whole stuff. And Dave, where what am I looking for? Am I looking for in data manager? Where am I looking? Or is it f is it where the is it where the file names are? Is it here? Is it uh sh is it here where um words importance file? In my display. Uh let me t I d Just Okay, so wh where did you say, in prog W you know where that is, just about? Above that. Like in In this main in this routine? There is something read importance with a zero and there is read word importance with a one. Shall I swap those around? Hmm? Well wha wha what what's the differe so th this is reall Yeah. Shall I just swap the file numbers around from now? Or would that crash anything? Oh yeah, and and we really leave a. Maybe have to find out where. Mm. Mm. So you have time this afternoon? Yeah. So here. So this shows if we see anything at all, then we see at the moment at least that we are definitely be um having a different summary, just because we're having a different im um important measure. So you see that um i it does something. Like at the moment I think this was yeah yeah, that's an old old old version. So it shows um and so if you if you think about how the old version happened, then you see it makes sense that words like prosody, just like a sing if that was the only utterance, then that probably scored quite well and stuff. Um we have to get these buttons, Dave. Yeah. Unfortunately, I didn't get the the bar on the display working just yet. But that should be a small issue. Yeah, I know this is very old. We just never bothered to update the stuff, because we were working on so we see that we have a very different density curve as well for this one. And Yeah, so from here we go, and it hopefully won't be too difficult to now first of all put the right segments in, put a sliding bar into this so that people see where they are. So I'm uh I'm I'm constantly touching stuff on my screen I realise. And and then make selections based on a segment. Now what we're not quite sure is what's the best way for like how the summariser works. Should it always compress a segment to a constant length though, by a constant factor of time? Or What would you think sort of if, you know, if if there's a certain degree of of summarisation, what should be the constant? So always like a. So it should always, whatever, reduce it to half the original 'Cause an al like an alternative view would be that Yeah. Yeah, well I guess that could be uh adaptable. 'Cause an an alternative view would be that you could sort of make it that it always is the same length. So if you like if the whole meeting is selected, it compresses the whole meeting to five minutes. Then if one um segment, uh w one topic is selected, then it plays this whole topic in five minutes. But that's sort of that gives people a bit less control over so maybe we should do it instead that it yeah, it c it you can spec Yeah. What's that you discussed for today though? What's there to talk about for today? Shall we abandon the whole notion of seeing the whole m one whole group as one single thing and just work on a p certainly from now on probably for good that means. I mean No. Do we have everything for the same meeting at the moment? Like is it are you y are you all working on the same meeting? Okay. Did anyone ever check if that's actually a good meeting like or f comparably to others? 'Kay. Yeah. 'Kay. Yeah. No. Yeah, especially because I mean that's that's that's only done like once every time the selection changes, right? So even if you sort of even if you do an hourglass at that moment and, you know, even if it pauses for ten seconds, well that's tough luck then. Uh, think we should just make sure that if it takes quite some time that that the clock doesn't start before or that the audio and the clock are in synch sort of. So th Yeah. Yeah, there's a wait for command for an external ca like for an external call to make sure that the external thing is finished because in general like that's sort of running parallel, I think. Yeah. I have some code for system calls like that handles the in and the output if you need some of that. Okay. Okay, cool. Um I don't really know what to talk about. We have See there's there's one week after my dissertation. So we're f uh before the presentation of the prototype. Which I can work a lot lot lot on this. So that's good. Um Yeah, well the graphic display will definitely have more information. Um if we're at the moment abandoning abandoning the concept of displaying the whole series of meetings just because it's for us like more bureaucracy, more complexity, and it probably just won't give us any brownie points in the presentation. Or do you think it will, I mean do you thi like I c We're As one meeting, yeah. Yeah, and then maybe have some basic information. Like if Yeah. So just a little bit of ad additional information in the display that knows where meetings, picking it over, and otherwise internally we treat it like so we have continuous I_D_s for the segments. Yeah, that works. Yes, but apart from that we don't really do anything different as if it was just one meeting. Yeah, I completely agree. So the only thing it would be that the display gets information about where they are and displays them as hard boundaries. Um Yeah, so the initially I thought it was sort of more a search functionality um that simply there's one button that says find similar segments, and then in the same display where we display the search results from the search. Wha Well I'm not so you think displaying uh like an information about similarity to the select uh like to a selected meeting in to a selected segment in the other segments? No no, I think that's I really don't wanna do that to be honest. Um it would be nice but like just Yeah, but i it it should appear as a continuous thing f for the yeah. But I'm not I'm not sure if it's worth much bother though. Like if we do a s like a similarity search, and just like you say find me similar segments and then sort of like you have a list and you click on one of them and then you go to that segment, I think that's quite useful um even without displaying them sort of dis-continuously. Well I was thinking of just like really just a m more or less just imagine those are search results each like each of them sort of them sort of giving whatever. We should aim to get some names for segments, like just some extraction of something that we can call. And if it's just the single highest um importance measure o phrase of a segment, so that we have something to display for them. Like basically just a summarisation down to one segment. And it would just be a list like this and you click on one and then w you tho you know, then the whole bureaucracy kicks in like this gets the nota notification, this gets the notification. And then we could like we could sort of use the same thing for um yours and mine. Because yours would sort of give just the segment I_D_s and mine would give the start segment I_D_s. So basically this display would have information about a segment where something starts. Maybe se well maybe also something where something ends, like for mine, and some string that we pass to describe what like what it is. You wait, your search, what would it return? Would it return just the specific like it would go right to the utterance, right? Yeah sure, sure sure. Um yeah. So in in your case like it would basically would probably say the utterance here or at least some part of the u yeah. And in my case it would say some name for the segment, and then you would just click on it and then like the whole thing would kick in. Like you c you click on it and and the selection moves and the display goes to that part. Yeah. Do we have them with a speaker at the moment? Okay, cool. Just random sp So what about So what about a general layout like this that we have here, the dialogue acts and there the player b And here we'd have a search button and the similarity thing button. I mean we can Ah, good question. Um Yeah. Yeah. I think we probably like we can leave those like I_ frames and just arrange them sort of. Yeah. Alternatively we'll have like the whole thing running already when we do the presentation and we just arrange it manually. My c Uh, apparently Microsoft sometimes or like at least in the past the demonstrations where they just exactly knew which five percent of the system were working. And that's what we're gonna do as well. Has anyone ever seen anything from the other group? They have all Ah. They have all sorts of sc scarily good If anything we build in a time bomb that only fails if the date is the date of the presentation. Yes, because we are nice people. Dave, this rate thing, do we have any direct control to that? Or is that just directly controlling how fast it plays and sort of we can only That's a pity because it looks like it's doing something. 'Kay. Um do you think if we override their component and just override whatever, the the action to that slide-bar is? So if so something like their skipping, would it actually corporate with our system at the moment? Would ours skip automatically forward? Yeah, I realise. Uh. Yeah, whatever. I think this simple this simple st view that we get that you can just like pass things into and then check when they got clicked really. Well couldn't the summar oh no, then we would have to override though. Hmm. But i in a sense I mean if we see uh yeah, but like probably that would be the same thing that we also display up here. Because I really think that having like some but that would probably even be shorter than five lines. Like really just getting I think getting one or two best utterances for each segment would be really worthwhile. For the search results I probably think that instead of a p a simple summary, something that displays the utterance where the where the word was like displays in a highlighted form where it was found. To to apply what? Well alternatively we could always have sort of a third small component, whatever, like if this was the search results, and then they are just like something else that's part unwritten when Miles goes over this one it triggers that one to display it or something. And a tool tip is I think a very straightf yeah, it especially with a preview we'll be able to get tool tip fairly simple because it's just a property of it. Uh, I've never seen tool tips displaying several lines and stuff though so I wonder how good that'll look. But we'll we can try that. Really? Well, so far only seen tool tips of few words length. But yeah, uh that should be fairly easy. Yeah yeah, we will have. That's actually just gonna happen today and we will have proper segments as well. Um the thing I remember, like I have to find out how to do it without redrawing the display each time, because the display at the moment does take, you see, like it takes a fraction of a segment to display, but probably too much to update it to completely repaint the whole thing every second. So um at the moment I'm just whenever it needs to be repainted, I'm not thinking about to do and just repainting the thing as a whole with a moving bar that's not a good idea. But until I think of something better, what I'll just do is I'll just I'll probably not have a moving bar the whole length, but just some indicator somewhere. Like whatever, just uh a triangle moving at the bottom for now or something. And then I can just like repaint a small area or something. Yeah. Yeah, I have to find I have to find out the the commands for like really just redrawing a small small piece. So I have to just there's examples t um for for doing stuff like that. I just have to read up on it. But yeah, displaying the the current position bar will be easy, provided that my whole calculations of like where we are in time here are all correct. I mean that's just something that isn't tested so far. But it should be. I mean So the the general concept, will will you two just uh keep on working on improving the information density measures or do you think there'll be a point when you say well that's that's it, we have we have an information density score and and we'll be looking for something else to do? Or Okay. 'Kay. Well, I'm actually at the moment I don't see how many people can work on on the programming anyway. Hmm? No. Did we Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well I guess I mean Uh I was a bit pissed off yesterday about that part because it was sort of just like a decision we had taken. So okay, we've been talking about evaluation l in the first report and there's nothing new we can say about it this time. And I thought we said that in the meeting before we wrote the report. And then he came back with this whole criticism saying like oh, you didn't say anything about um evaluation and then yeah, but we did that in the last report. We said we're not gonna go oh, but now I expected it in more detail and Oh. If that translates to eighty percent, like if if those actually translate to to really like their percentage scores, then that would be good. Hmm. Sixteen? What? There were forty percent each and this is how they became sixty percent Now what Okay. Um how much do you think there were? Ten each. Not bad. We also it it just means that he's relatively lenient because I mean the reports were I think they were ok good reports. But like probably somebody else wouldn't have said they were excellent. So that's a good sign 'cause it shows that he's not hell-bent on Uh And then he'll see the final display and he'll realise that it was all fake, that we didn't actually do any of the work. See the thing is Like for me personally, I think a lot of work will be done in in the last minute, in this specific case. That's not a new statement at general. But Like the week just before the presentation, I have most of the stuff that I I'm doing now, I'm rid of it, including the dissertation and DIL. So Hmm. So Jasmine, if if you got something like this and like this for for your current data, would that help in I sort of have been promising this for a week now I realise. I'm gonna give you Uh, 'cause it's empty at the moment. I mean Dave i it's a pretty much r it sh should be a question of copying it over it r over, right? So I just didn't Yeah. Can probably add a open file dialogue box with minimum effort because I think it's a ready-made component that returns a string for a file name. Or that w yeah. So we can do that today? Yeah. Yeah, but why don't we? Yeah, I know, sure it j like it it would not necessary need to be a part of the final thing, but why don't we just provide some means, even if it does it automatically in the beginning as a start-up option, just to ask for a file name. 'Cause then we can just publish a script that you just run and then this whole thing starts. You know what happened to me today, like I forgot about the whe I'm not sure if we had that problem before, finding the Java media, the Java X_ media stuff on all the jars for that. Yeah, I was like suddenly panicking at eleven when I realised God, I just thought it would be very straight-forward to get it going here. And then I got that thing. Yes, so um if we do a version which automatically opens up a file open box. You're yeah, f so you're automatically producing the right format with this no um with just per utterance. Okay. Mm-hmm. So would it be easy slash dissu difficult slash impossible like at the moment if we skip to a s treating a whole series as one thing. So like creating one file for the whole series that gives the uttera the ideas from top to bottom and But the entire corpus. It Hmm. Yeah. Where do you think you can uh produce something like that. Like I think we should go for like for one group, not for the whole corpus. No no n Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no but Dave um yeah, so tha that's what I was thinking that like the second meeting should continue till the first one's stopped. A and for one group that's true because it's sort of like their meeting's you know, like that one meeting and then Hmm? The utterances. Okay and and that's the But it just doesn't make sense in the logic-wise, sort of like until here it's the meeting about this thing and then it's that thing and then it's it's this like. Whereas Whereas uh s mayb maybe we're talking k like so so your data manager, would that then handle the whole thing? Would that handle it that this would only like the display would only display one group? Yeah, so if I mean I don't mind where it's done. So if the data manager filters it out and like I just think that in in the logic of the programme it's it's much easier to justify why we say we treat a series of meetings as one single thing rather than w But a I b like would just I would find logical reasons for why you can sugg say peop Uh but I see this two completely g def like I see each ser each group is completely separate amount of data that shouldn't Okay. But would it still like would we still in the logic of it still have continuous I_D_s if we say we take just just one meeting. Like would would the display for example still be able to just say I want from whatever from the first until the last and and everything in between sort of and and the data manager would then display that just for that meeting. Okay well, if that's possible, yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's what Vera said. No. So you you'd you'd also say that it shouldn't be part of the importance measure if there's no F_ zero. Yeah. Well, I I don't know how we're gonna do the fusing of the different if inf importance measures anyway. Bu if that's done in the programme or if that's done off-line. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Does anyone have a good idea like at the moment to play around with it, what's a good way of displaying two types of information in the in the colour display. I mean uh there's probably logical ways, like if one is whatever, if one is the darkness and the other is the redness or something. Has anyone ever experimented with sort of displaying two-dimensional information in in colour? Because then we could do Jasmine's and and Vera's probably in the same scale. Yeah. F for now. No, for now. Like yeah, for us. Hmm. S Yeah. Yeah, I think we sh we shouldn't T We should assume a n assume a non-linguistic user. But I think probably for us, like in developing it, it would be interesting. Yeah, so um I'll try the red green blue. Wha what's does anyone know what this hue and saturation thing, like what that no, nobody's done much colour work. Oh actually it's not a problem of doing it. Like I think it's Okay. Okay, well I guess I'll just take a look at the Photoshop colour cube or whatever it is, GIMP colour cube, and look at Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay, so we'll produce a version of this which opens up with a dialogue box um where you can select a file? Is that right, Dave? Would we be able to do that? And and then you'll get this type of display with that file. And that's uh at the moment are w so are we are we still talking about using that one meeting that everyone is using now? Are talk about swat swi swapping now? Switching. Yeah. So everyone should produce stuff for the whole corpus now? Or Okay. Okay. We need the explicit information about each meeting then. Like sorta whi from which utterance which utterance it goes and stuff. Is anyone is anyone providing that at the moment? I didn't does any Okay. Okay. Well if you Yeah, I'm not sure about that. As in I just don't understand much about how difficult it is to do to do different things. Well as l as long as yeah. As long as everything's in the right order, it shouldn't like we should even be able to just I_D_ it when we're reading it in. Hmm. 'Kay. Yeah, so if we email out a script on how to like f load it Um so yours would always like yours would always be loaded in, I guess. Like you y there would only be one version of your data, and you can just override that version if you want. But you wouldn't have a file open dialogue box for that then. Well what would the option be? Okay, but like so make it an option which one it displays or which one it uses for the summarisation or 'cause it 'cause I was just thinking sort of so that both Jasmine and Vera could um see their data working and Mm is that not getting too much? So we would have like each of those components for for Jasmine and Vera. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But would that not require three clocks and I but that but but that also means Okay. 'Cause the dialogue uh the display also gets the information about like the relative and the absolute times. So that would be convenient if that just if there's just one of that, 'cause otherwise it's getting messy. So why don't we just make a swap ins why don't we make a switch instead, like I don't wanna do like three like three internal time-scales so that's just getting messy. Well I guess really I mean like alternatively why don't we go for the simplest thing and just create three scripts or two scripts which load a parameter uh f common line parameter, which is which file to load, and and then it's just there. Okay. Yep. Okay. Would the others Oh you oh you just have three summarisers, and then they're all synched up with one clock. Okay, the other one is just a static dialogue acts box. Okay. Okay. Yep. So we have three colour displays. Like three or No no, sure. Or maybe just start with just two like without even combining them in any sophisticated way. Just just two. Yep. 'Kay, shall we wrap that up? Sor sorry, I'm imposing. You mean discontinuous? If I have to do it f like flexibly, then I probably then it will not be significantly more difficult. But is it worth any effort though I mean? 'Cause we'll never have more than two and we'll never ha well, we'll either have one or two. So in the end 'cause you don't have different versions of well, I guess you probably would have. But then also we'd have to find more sophisticated ways of loading it, specifying the parameters. So that might Yeah, but that we wouldn't so we'd have to have some dialogue box for opening stuff. It might be it might take half an hour in the display and not more than that. Hmm. But it might actu I think it might not really be worth it to be honest. Let's work on the other stuff first, like the other stuff, and just provide like something where each of them just if if there's uh a Jasmine script and a Vera script and they each can load their stuff and see their data in in the thing. They ca they each can see it summarised by their data, and the other one is the static one. That should be fairly easy to do, right? If I just double the display and you make a uh like a non-synched up second dialogue acts. And yeah, and then they can tune, fine-tune their measures. I think it would be cool if we could check the NITE clock f code or whatever code it is for this component and see if we can access those rate things and and do something useful with them and get notified when they change and stuff. Yeah, I think Yeah, I think that's what we should do. So the the thing is it's probably an easy task to read that rate, but it's probably more difficult to get an event automatically when it's changed. So that's why we might have to extend NITE clock and like override the function that react to that. Or like the rate is probably a property, which in the worst case we'd have to set public, but if we wanna react to it being changed automatically, we might have to. Okay. So they haven't sp okay. Yeah, so it shouldn't like even if to even if uh if we have to extend NITE clock, I mean it should just be a matter of changing one single method in it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yep. Yeah. Yep. And we could justify all sorts of stuff like that by r in the presentation by saying we deliberately tried to keep any complexity and numbers and stuff away from people. I think that's sort of a line we should go by in general, sort of saying yeah, we could've done oh so many th We don't wanna confuse people. We give people something simple and colourful where something is moving and where they don't have to l deal with any numbers or text or anything like that for that matter. In fact that's why we've given you a picture of a dog sitting in a field instead of a meeting browser. It is nice and it calms people down. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Shall we meet in an hour or so, Dave? I'm probably gonna eat something quick. Ah okay, I was actually I was planning the same, but we won't get so much done before three, that's the thing. 'Kay listen, so why don't we meet after three then, because then I can like until three make sure that I have all the display c Yeah, sure, yeah. S oh so we could meet at five and I have the display code ready by then, which does the stuff like like having a bar where the position is and stuff. And Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah, so we can meet in five in Apple at five in Appleton tower and just work on so I'll I'll have my displ I'll make sure that my display does all the stuff we've been talking about un until then. And then we'll put those things together. Yeah. But I mean like we we should discuss together which w like how the the search interacts with the rest. So that's not something that Colin should just do in his own.
Yep. Right. That's pretty good. Mm. Mm, I suppose it should depend on the length of the segment. Mm, I guess that would make more sense, yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, I was wanting to talk about the search. Yeah. Yeah, I'm quite keen to do like most of that. Like make an index search and stuff. Yeah, I think what basically what I need at is um just a list of words with an index to start with for each meeting. Um I suppose it doesn't really matter as long as they're unique and it can I can pass 'em back to you and you can use that to the display. Um yeah, probably. Yeah. Oh yeah, do you want you know how you've just got data for one meeting, are you needing more at the moment? Mm, I guess not. Yeah, I think we're all using the first one. Hmm. Um I think it segments quite well though, first one. Yes, it's not really important that we get it like nice and c clean or anything like that. Mm Hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah, I suppose my search will r it returned the utterance, but if you're searching for a word, you need an index for the word and the utterance as well. Um it p it'd probably select it, yeah. It would make sense to do that. Yeah. Very very basic, yeah. Yeah, yeah. If yeah, if if you can pass me like the dialogue act with Yeah, was it the speaker. And then It Yeah, that that should be enough, shouldn't it? 'Cause you can Oh yeah, I d I did that, yeah. Yeah, I d I did that as well actually. Um yes, in the data. Yeah, group data, speaker data, or something. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Is it sorry, could I d use that? At the moment it's ready to like get dialogue acts out with Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Alright. Yeah, I should maybe just get started with 'em. Making a search with that. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah of course, we've got here. That would be evil. Yeah. Oh dear. Oh. Yeah, maybe it has a different constructor when you create it. Is it? Oh yeah. I suppose. Yeah. So do you think a tree-view for like an overview of the whole set of meetings would be good? Yeah, it w it would look good. Hmm. Yeah, I suppose you could calculate them off-line and just, yeah, have a like like a l little thumbnail or something. Yeah. I mean it would be a bit pointless, but it would look good for the presentation. Yeah. I suppose. Yeah. Hmm. I've never done it, but I'd imagine it must be quite easy. Yeah, it'd be nice for a presentation, yeah, yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Is that quite easy to do to get um a moving cursor? Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I was just gonna do some sort of informal evaluation. Yeah, I did say that. Yeah. Yeah, he did give us eight out of ten though. Yeah. Yeah. No I think they were ten percent each. Yeah. I think they're worth ten percent? Hmm. Yeah, I suppose he can see that we're putting the work in. I Yeah, that yeah, that interface and integration, yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, same for me. Oh yeah. Oh no, I forgot about that. Um I'm gonna do like an on-line museum archive. You get like a document for each exhibit. Oh yeah. Oh that'd be quite a good one actually. Yeah, would you have to do like music notation and stuff? Right. Okay, that's n not so. Hmm. Hmm. Well I have I've only done the first meeting. But yeah, th that's the plan. Um for the topic segments? Yeah, sorry, for topic segments I have. But for the utterances I've just got one meeting so far. But the idea was that it would be continuous. Yeah. Remember how did I do it. Hmm. I th think it should be done in the program 'cause we're probably gonna want to change it. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, we should be consistent, yeah. Hmm. Yeah, it should be easy to do, yeah. Yeah, I've got the indexes for all the meetings I think. Yeah. No, I don't think so. Yeah, I'll be working on the search, I think. It's ready to get started. Yeah, I may as well come and you can show me how it the manager works. Yeah.
Ah yeah. Mm-hmm. So uh which version of my data was that, the very first one? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, v I mean really doesn't matter. Just wanted to know if I'm just Yeah. Yeah, probably. Probably all these uh-huhs and uh-hmms are spelled differently in the thing or what's the problem. You should generalise.. Ah-ha. That's a very old one rather. I think those S_s and E_s and so on, the single letters, are because of the problem with my um first version of the text thing. 'Cause I think the Hmm. Yeah, but but perhaps more than half. Otherwise you go in too slowly, yeah. Um uh sorry, the only problem with the first meeting is for ex that there's no um a hot spot annotation for that. But I mean that's not not a real problem. M I uh think it might. Why, because um i um Steve lay quite a lot of um weight on um you know uh surfing through meetings. So we should at least provide an overview of different meetings of one group. At the beginning he um talked quite a lot about that. Um and what about the similarity measure for segments? Do we um also present that in this window, and do we do it across meetings? Uh I think that was planned at the beginning, wasn't it? Yeah. Uh okay. So it wouldn't be displayed in in the uh graphical display. Oh. Um no. I I'm just coming back to our initial idea of presenting some, you know, all the similar segments in uh across meetings and separating by uh some things like Mm-hmm. Oh, I I have that file. So just Did you overtake that code from the original thing? Yeah, but also speeding up the audios and s Um where we have a moving band the graphical display that also moves according to the Yeah. Uh f I'm pretty sure that I can uh always find something to improve there. So I mean if you need me to work on something else, um I can try to finish my stuff um early, but um otherwise I can still keep working on it, improving it, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, ten percent. So so you want um the dialogue act numbers to be um continuous throughout the corpus so that second meetings begins with three hundred um something. Couldn't we couldn't we just um take the um a name each um each dialogue act um meeting dot um dialogue act number. It would be a la longer name, but A problem um yeah. For example as there are not um F_ zero values for every speaker or on sometimes not for every meeting, um how will I count that up? I mean Ah okay. At the moment I don't even generate any document uh document for those. But because I mean it's not zero, it's just a noun. Hmm. But wouldn't it be better for the importance measure if that just wouldn't be part of it then? The Hmm? Yeah. Yeah, but do we really want do display them separately because the user won't okay, for now for our s okay. Yeah, but then the user would have to know about what s w was what and what contributed to the blue stripes and what contributed to the red ones. Uh I think that wouldn't be a good idea. Mm-hmm. Okay. Couldn't we couldn't we write one programme that calculates all the um f for all our different contributions to the importance measure the um a absolute um dialogue act numbers for the meeting. Because at the moment we all produce the numbers for each meeting separately. Yeah, but we should all use the same programme, I think. Would prevent us from having too much mistakes in it. Or at least uh the mistakes would be consistent. No, it's not really difficult. It's just Yeah, I mean I can do it. I can read in the different um importance measures and then re re-calculate the numbers. Mm.",EN2001d
"And something to fidget with. Okay. See On your marks, get set, go. Such a long time since I've done these. At the beginning we did. Um we did a training set, didn't we, and then compared to see we probably did. And supposedly decided on things. And then we did th all the rest of them separately. Yes, I think. Okay. Yeah, but you convinced me. No, that's true. Mm-hmm. It's the length of it really. But we had That's really hard, yeah. Mm-hmm. No. Yeah. And we we had a manual, which we haven't got here. Do you reckon if we get a copy, would that be useful? Are we allowed to leave the meeting now it's started? Can we get Ben to print us out one? Mm. Okay. Yes, now we're moving with the headphones. Yes, he's he's been e emailed it, yeah. Otherwise we can go onto our system and get it. Yes. Let's say something rude. I oh. top. But no, how little work we did. I'm doing that at yes. Yeah. They have got a conference thing, haven't they? In the A_T_C_. I had to fly to Germany to do a teleconference, the same as you did for the interview. And they fly you to Germany and put you on a four-way teleconference with three people in Chile. And had they asked, we could have done it fine at A_T_C_ and saved me having to to go to Germany for a day. But they haven't got that far. Mm. And mine was even it was different again. W we had it was a four-way split screen with me and three other people, and it just stayed like that. And I had the talk on a laptop in front of me and they had the talk on their laptops, and I had to tell tell them when to press the button to turn the page. It just Yes, if you see towards the top left of the image, you'll notice And luckily Olivia had warned me it might be complicated, and so I had something with without very many um n not little flying in and things, because that would just make it really difficult. But I practised the talk, yeah, standing up in front of it and pointing to things, and you're sitting down in front of And you could see yourself, but not only could s you see yourself, you see yourself bounce back two seconds later. By the time the signal had gone to Chile and back. So you're like oh, did I just do that? And then you reacting to what you did a while ago. It was a really daft situation. Lovely. And then we can start fighting about Yes, let's. Continuum flux or continuum. Mm. Yes. Flux on its own wouldn't be a spectral feature. I think it should probably just be continuum. If it was continuum luminosity, you probably wouldn't it. Ooh. Okay, it's my part. Oh. I think I think we've worked Yes, and I'm pretty sure I'm bottom anyway. So even on one we can tell. 'Cause I would fight for line being a spectral feature as well. It's a bit hard to mark on this. Let's do that. The ones we want. Yes. And if neither, then we'll have to put something else. And I think you're probably right, soft component is a spectral feature. Ooh. Well, if you don't No. Yeah, go ahead. Mm-hmm. Pi You can point to a soft component. Yeah. Is it? Uh, now is a feature part of spectral feature? I think you're right there as well. 'Cause it it's not just absorption. But it's not just absorption point five K_V_. It is actually something in the absorption that you're seeing. If it was a a dip in absorption or a a lack of absorption, you would put it in, because we said we would put describing words. Mm-hmm. you would get a pencil. That's two. Ah, there's one with the equivalent width. I think you're right that we we weren't gonna mark the equivalent width, but we were gonna mark the lines. Broad line. And that should be a And nebulae. As a source type. I can't remember. Should we see when the manual comes. So let's come back to that one. Um Yep. I what we're doing about that either. Select a Yeah, that seems reasonable. Yes. Um Breaking the power law index, I think that's probably a you can point to it, but equally it's not a it's something you've derived. So what's a breaking a power-law index? Mm-hmm. Yep. Okay. Slight depression of the continuum near the Lyman limit. I think you're right there as well. But we're supposed to say w Yeah, i if it was absorption at H_ alpha, that would all be one. Or absorption at five thousand nanometres would all be one anyway, because it was at a certain point. But this is near. Yeah, I think you're right. It's it's near rather than at. It's not. Let's mark that then. Yes. Is that K_ clear? Oh.. Mm absorption. Yes, and you're right there as well. Tell you who's more awake at this. Mm-hmm. An absorption feature. Thank you. There is no steep soft component but our two K_V_. Mm. Yes, you could. I tend to miss out things if they're too long. Um You would point to it. Yeah. Yes, I think you're right. Should we go back to number five? But yes, nebula. Mm-hmm. I think it does. We weren't matching a H_ two regions, because it was a region I think was the argument for that. Line again. Line in ratios. But I remember we weren't gonna mark line ratios, but we were going to mark 'cau we're here where you've got equivalent width of H_ beta orbited. Ratio is different I guess. Mm. I guess it's similar. Don't include Is that the value or is that the word? Don't it in include the derived property? You wouldn't include line in that? Okay.. The one to keep, yeah. Damped Lyman alpha absorbers, I think that's a spectral feature even though it's You wouldn't mark the source type. Here. Yes, because we don't want it underlined. It shouldn't be highlighted. So. Yeah. M Mm-hmm. But it's also a I i if we have But th but you also absorb them by Y you observe them by their spectral feature. What were we doing for things broad absorption line quasar for example. We were marking the broad absorption line as well as broad absorption line quasar. So I think it should be the same as that. If it's defined by a spectral feature, we should mark it. Here. You could point to damped Lyman alpha though. Because it says here, spectral features we're now referring to a type of source, E_G_ quasar. Um not a bis specific type of source, but I think still the the spectral feature ge counts, even though it's m a modifier of something. What do you reckon, Bob? How does it work? I don't know what which doesn't help. Mm-hmm. Y ye But that doesn't mean that it's you could still say that's damped Lyman alpha and that's damped Lyman alpha. You could say all of that is damped Lyman alpha. But isn't that j always the case with something that's not particularly Mm-hmm. It it if it was if it was some other spectral feature and then absorbers, would we mark it? But But we include modifiers of source types we would mark. We're not marking absorbers. But if it was a damped Lyman alpha quasar. then we would mark quasar and we would mark damped Lyman alpha. If it was broad absorption line quasar, we'd mark it. Yeah. So it's just I guess whether damped Lyman alpha is a spectral feature in itself. Which I would probably say it was, but then I've never looked at i one. Mm-hmm. It doesn't have to be something that's specific. I guess y you know, we we say a uh big blue bump or a soft or a continuum. And we include those. That true, but w we have included c power law though. Well no, we included p steep soft component, sorry. And here we included breaking the power law, because of the break. Mm-hmm. But there's still some degree of fitting and it's steep, you're saying. You know, what's steep and what's shallow. Let's have that for now then. You if if we change our mind later when we go through, we can always come back to it and say Yeah, you're right. And absorption again. Right, what have we got different here? Hmm. It's Yeah, it's that one and this one here. Oh, we were including feature within spectral feature. Okay. I think I just missed it. I think it's not as if it's a although it's four widths half maximum, it's still the s the line within it. Silicone two is an element rather than a In this context. Rather than a line. These are the lines. I guess what you w If wasn't in there, then you'd have it silicone two lines at but without with the I think that means silicone two derived from these two features. Okay. Mm. Lyman alpha forest clouds. Lyman alpha forest you can point to on the spectrum. So we haven't basically, we just haven't got a a rule for spectral features within or referring to s types of source when we're not bother marking the source. So are we marking H_ two and H_ two regions, for example? Oh, that's true. But b yeah, but I guess it's not it's not defined by a spectral feature though, H_ two region, whereas Lyman alpha forest is defined by the definition of Lyman alpha forest clouds is that they have Lyman alpha forests. But someone's l someone's looked at that spectrum. I don't think we were making diffuse diffuse emission or Um Hmm. Mm. It's a modifier of of clouds, but I don't th don't think if we're including the I think if we're not including nebula and clouds, we can't include Perhaps we should've done. But we haven't done for the whole thing. So I think maybe we just need to put under don't include diffuse emission. But then we still have to decide if we don't label the source, what do we do about the spectral features that define that source? I if we have for example broad absorption line object, we mark that. We mark broad absorption line in that. It's an but just to know this is a Lyman alpha forest cloud, we're seen Lyman alpha forest. But it's still a spectral feature, even if it's not it might be a spectral feature i not in the cloud, but it a spectral feature in the quasar, the Lyman alpha forest. Okay. Even if not marked. No one else can read that, sorry. Okay, so th Lyman alpha forest again. And that definitely is a spectral feature on its own then, 'cause it doesn't even say Lyman alpha forest clouds. Each helium two optical depth, I think that's elemental species. Oh. Oh, we marked the same lines. What have we done differently? 'Cause the property of the line. They're gonna we're gonna have a lot of these. And we weren't using line What was the one we didn't do before? Line ratio we weren't doing. Was talking about l lines, okay. Line feature, need that. There's only one difference here. No, no, they are the same otherwise. Quite impressively. That one's the same. And damped Lyman alpha data. I can't even but if you said If you said the spectral dat The continuum's spet mm. But if it's a damped Lyman alpha spectrum, you'd mark damped Lyman alpha, because in the spectrum. And and a da is equivalent of spectrum. That's because it was talking about s but if it's saying silicone two line. Levels the new word. I think you're probably right in the case of it being data. Mm. Well If it's an emission line data Mm. If it's an emission line data, would we put it in? But if it just said em but if it just said emission line, we would. It the emission line is strong. The emission line data shows strong. Then uh I think it's the same actually, I th I think it's data isn't even needed. It's inconsistent with the damped Lyman alpha at more than the ninety nine percent. Or the damped Lyman alpha feature, if you put feature there rather than data, then you'd mark it. But I think data is equivalent if Yeah. Okay. That's think enough. Given that we can argue about it for ten minutes, it's probably not that clear-cut. Damped Lyman alpha systems and uh it shouldn't be either of them. It should be damped Lyman alpha in red, whatever that is. Spectral feature. And that shouldn't be there at all. And I've done it twice. Is that clear enough? Flat spectrum We were including modifiers, including broad line quasars, non broad line quasars as well. So I think we should probably include the flat spectrum with your q with your quasar is a very different from steep spectrum. We're ten percent of the way there. Continua. Oh gosh, it will be here forever. Remarkably soft ionising continua. You're right though, I think. Or or continuum. The absorbed continuum. Mm-hmm, yes. Oxygen shouldn't be there. That's not observed. Heavy element absorption lines I think should be there. Now what else is different? Mm. Oh, thank you. And that one. You're right, star-forming galaxies are distinct. That's, yeah, derived. Probably because you were doing seven thousand of these an hour. You mean that? If it was lines from H_ two you'd mark it. Blue wing flux. What were we gonna do about flux? Doesn't say. Yes, it's the amount of stuff in the blue wing. So I'm happy with that. Line peak. I think that should be marked. Even though it's talking about increasing line peak, it's also talking about increasing excess blue wing. Should actually be excess blue wing flux. Anyway. I think line peak is something you can point to. No, but you can't you can't s also point to increa increasing blue wing. What Mm. Okay. Light. Ye yes. Right. Neutral hydrogen Gunn-Petersen absorption. I think all of that's a spectral feature. It's basically a way of saying the Gunn-Petersen t it's a way of saying the Gunn-Petersen trough though. Which, if you just said that it's Gunn-Petersen absorption from neutral hydrogen rather than i if it was a t if it was hydrogen absorption, you'd mark the whole thing. If it was hydrogen align you would, so you should mark if it was or H_ beta absorption. It's a marks the kind of spectral feature, doesn't it? But so is H_ beta absorp uh emission as a process from H_ beta. But it's still this is a process from neutral hydrogen. I guess what I'm meaning is neutral hydrogen should be in there. And the fact that Gunn-Peterson comes between it is just a pain. Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's just cross everything out. Blue-shifted absorption. I think it's a modifier of the thing, and so it probably should be there. As in we're putting weak and strong absorption would count, so I think blue-shifted should. Um that's talking about the line, isn't it? So that should be in. Yeah. That's talking about uh strength rather than It's not the uh abundance of it or any derived property, it's just the strength of the lines. I guess perhaps it is. Um let's make a decision. I guess it could be abundance. Yes, that's true. I think you probably should then, 'cause we will put in our align strength. Uh if it's a F_ i of a two line strength we would definitely put it in. And I think that's what it's referring to, even though it's not It's not saying two. Its lines. It's an abundance i it's an element I guess, but it's But it's a strength rather than abundance. I think that's still looking at the amount of flux coming out of the out of all the F_E_ two lines, rather than In general we haven't if unless it's specifically saying it's a line, but I guess the question is just as specifically referred to a line. And I maybe it's not clear enough to mark. Let's not mark it then. Well line, narrow line. If it says it F_E_ two line strength then we would mark it, 'cause you're talking about the line of it rather than the ev element. The word line should be in there. Or Yeah, I think they mean l I think they mean the line strength rather than the F_E_ two abundance. I think that's what they probably mean. But it's just not very clear. B_S_, bloated star. That's a Yeah. Um take out line. And that's just the wrong that's just the wrong colour, as is that. I think you were right there. Yep, you're right. And you're right there as well. That's a physical process. Yes, that was one I wasn't sure about, 'cause infrared. And if it was mid-infrar uh if it was, you'd put it in. That's just the wrong na that's just this should be a source name. I don't know w Yes. I guess the problem is due to what does that m mean. I presumed it Is it? Okay, right. 'Cause that's one I just didn't know what it Uh I thought it was a catalogue. Mm. H_ alpha I think should be marked, yeah. Yeah, you're still detecting a line, even if you're detecting it from broad-band filters. Um Broad-band Broad line region, you are right. And now align nebulae. Okay, we'll just go back and change those. You're right. Okay, where was it? Started here. Um Why did it so we mark Um we have got nebulae marked here. Oh. Yeah, okay, modifiers with them, which is give a yell if you see one. So damped Lyman alpha absorbers shouldn't be in there. But then I'm i I p I probably use that rule so half the time, and just forgotten to use at other times. Mm. Yeah. Yes, I I'm sure I've followed that rule sometimes and just forgotten. So let's take that out. Um Lyman alpha forest here. But lyman alpha forest should be in here, because it's not talking about uh m it's not modified. Damped Lyman alpha data. Data I think we should keep in. Because it's would be the same as feature. Or spec spectrum. I think data's the same as spectrum, 'cause the data is a spec m Final view, Bob? Okay. Mm let's take that out. And this one comes out as well. Okay, so we want nothing. There. Didn't it? Yeah. Right. We're there. Right. H_ alpha detection. But I wouldn't is H_ alpha broad-brand? It's a line. Whether you detect it H_ alpha emitters are not a distinct class of source, I don't think. Line. Mm-hmm. But I guess if you're picking out a spectral feature, even with a broad band or narrow band then it's still a spectral feat feature. If you're picking out a line. What however you pick it out. Line on its own. I think there's gonna be a lot of those, which makes life simpler. Yep. Absorption profiles. I think that I think the whole thing should actually be marked. Even this complex. How far should we go? Comple just absorption, per. Um Lyman alpha forest line blanketing or Lyman alpha forest line? Is it a system? V_L_B_A_ is an instrument. Oh, is it? Is a network. But is it? Yes. V_ V_L_ b very long baseline array. V_L_B_A_. If it had an A_ on the end, it would be the ne instrument. Yes, 'cause it ta it takes an image. So Oh, but then a m research group could take an image. Okay, let's oh, how much of modifiers are we putting in? From one point six or from European? Or just um V_L_B_A_ He's using capitals. But s Okay. Uh-huh. Okay.. That's just broad-band, isn't it? Broad line emission. So that shouldn't be marked. Radio-loud objects. It's not ve it's not a m mod It's not an original system. M Anything ending in object we don't include, yep. So none of those. Yep. Now we've both marked line ratios here. And that's the same. Continuum. And there it's different, because you're talking about the ionizing continuum, which is a pre Yeah. I think you can point to line pairs. And that shouldn't be in there. Yep. Scribble away. You're right there. That's all one big spectral feature. And nebula shouldn't be marked. What do we do back here? What did we do back here? We did mark nebula, yes. It was things that weren't distinct, like yeah. Mm-hmm, yeah, it's a difficult one. But if we're gonna stick to it, let's stick to it. The? The. And I think we need the. I think we would put stop putting the in, we could get confused. And you're right there. Oh, yeah. Line blanketing, you think y We had line blanketing just now and we included it. I think we sh um. Where was it? Don't think n Lyman f forest line blanket, we took blanketing out. And that's all the same. Yes. Yes, it is. Red and blue components. I think you're right there as well.. Yeah, I think i in the same way that you can point to the soft X_ rays or or the hard X_ rays, you can point to the red and the Hmm. But we're talking about the c the continuum though. If you have a galaxy spectrum though, you can say there's the blue component, there's the red component to the spectrum. Oh, I see what you mean, i like it comes from adding two different things together. I can see that, yeah. Yes. But if it said red or blue excess rather than red or blue component, I guess the problem with Mm-hmm, okay. Let's If you modelled it with two parts, one that had a a ha a harder and softer spectrum Hubble in Hubble deep field south. I didn't include it. Although it does apply to the telescope. But mm. Let's keep it in. Anyone remember when? Let's start at the beginning. Oh. Excellent. Um Hubble.. No wait, the top one I think you should include. Possibly with flux as well though. And then yes, the whole thing. Well, I said radio galaxies. Now what did we p we say about acronyms where part of it was useful? Um Um But I don't think we should mark high red-shift in that. They are just red-shi but yes. Wh what did we say about acronyms where Yes, I think you are. Seyfert one point eight and one point nine galaxies You wouldn't say we're talking about yes. I think they probably are. Inseparate. And it's just the and that annoys. Mission line feature we're gonna include. Galaxy when it's a process. Yes. Ah, now this is one where it should be this one, but what if you'd un if these are doubly underlined? Has it just plotted the top colour? Yes. Okay, because what we want here let's just mark what we want and mark that, but with also broad line I can't write. We changed it so that you could. Yeah, because quite often uh an object class is defined by a spectral feature. Like broad line radio galaxies. Broader lines, I think. List the wrong wrong colour for a few things. Oh, it's all here. Hyper-luminous galaxy. Mm-hmm. This is just a colour issue. Ye Yeah, they should all be and that one. I_S_M_. It's diffuse. So it probably shouldn't be in there. Oh. No. What we doing about nebula again? I've forgotten. Okay. Yeah. Features. Flat spectrum radio quasars. Strong drop in the continuum. I think you're right there. I think you're right again. That's just the place. Um we're not doing emission line when it's a modifier of objects, are we? The question is are emission line objects a separate class of source? I think they are. Yes, you're right. And Seyfert galaxies w should be one, you're right there. I got three seventy.
Right. 'Kay. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. He has had it certainly. Yeah. Yeah, he's been emailed it while ago. Now he's gone. Oh really? Excellent. We should have these things in our area. You know, we don't have high-tech things. Well, I guess there's telescopes, but that that's that's different though, isn't it. That's not no. Yeah, that's right, although you oh it isn't actually used all that often these days, I think. Gosh. Right, aye. Right. Gosh. And you miss all the the body language and things. Yeah, yeah. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Oh. Right. Gosh. Yeah. Yeah. That's very artificial though, isn't it? Yeah. Not very sensible. Yeah, right. Yeah. That must be really weird. Is there? Gosh. Yeah. Gosh. Well Mm-hmm. Great. Do you think? Sorry, I I shouldn't intervene probably. But well the um isn't it that if um it's a region of the spectrum that's u and we can point at it. And then it is a sp a sp spectral f f feature, and that isn't You think? Okay, alright. Okay. Okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a feature. Um because in the s sp spectrum it does that and it does that. So it yeah. That's that is where it breaks. So yeah. Oh, you want to s split that one and, do you, into two? Yeah. Yeah. Uh I'd agree with that, I think. Yeah. Thanks. But if it had been there, um you would've had it as a feature. Yeah, because you haven't actually listed explicitly um that you're not going to include it. L line ratio is after abundances. So Oh, I see what you mean. Um Well No. Yeah. Um Well, I mean you could look at this this spectrum and spot that um th L Lyman alpha has been damped.. That is a n spectral feature. Oh yeah. No, that's true. Different redshifts. Yeah yeah yeah, that's true. Yeah, but But you're guessing in a way though, aren't you? So Mm that's a that's a tricky one, certain certainly. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you have all of it? Right, well th yeah, th that's in the the manual. So I g I guess it is. I And that it is altering the spectrum, isn't it? I mean is a ch change in the s spectrum of background objects. Uh is that right? Yeah. No. Yeah, I think so too in that M That's actually an ionic species, isn't it actually? Not a a spectral feature as such o on its own. No. B b why aren't you marking it then? Uh-huh. Well, that's p what I'm p pondering really. Um Yeah, but this is um species of cloud, it's a p a particular species of cloud, not just a general cloud, isn't it? So isn't that different? Okay, th Then I guess not then. Yeah. And But it's in this s sp sp sp sp spectrum of another object though. It it isn't the spectrum of the clouds. Yeah. That is true. Uh and he could point at it, that's true, and say that is Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah. I'm not sure actually. I th I think I would mark it. And And that it It is a region of the spectrum and they're actually using a region of the spectrum as the data. Um But if you both want not to mark it, then fine, don't mark it. Mm. Right. You have to s speed up. We'll go p could be here all day. Well I y Yeah, I don't think you can. Yeah, uh I don't think that's a feature. Really? It's a process, isn't it? Well Isn't that a process? It's a process, isn't it? Well it I wouldn't have any of it, I think. I think all of that is um just that is process. Isn't it? Yeah. You think? Um You don't think that it Actually is abundance really in a way. I'm not sure. But I'm not sure. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Uh i Well, but it Isn't this an elemental um abundance that you estimate actually using a number of lines? Is it it isn't just one discrete line in the spectrum, is it? B I'm not sure. Well if you t Two is an ionic species and it'll have a number of Lines in the spectrum, and you'll uh estimate On the abundance all of the s species actually use the old lines. They haven't been if it's yeah. I think so, yeah. Oh well, what's new. Okay. Well, then have it in. Yeah, yeah, okay. What does that mean? Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Sorry, what's the I can't see. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't I think now probably. Well H_ L_ was a line there really, isn't it. So Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Yeah, exactly that. Yeah, exactly that. Yep. Technique. Yeah. The network is an instrument though, isn't it. It It's E_V_N_, isn't it? Well it Isn't all of This is an instrument if you have it all, isn't it? I think so. Yeah. But um Which it is, uh I think. That's what I think. Oh, I think it's uh um s s s starting with um Eu European I think. Uh yes. Just in Europe. But it's actually Merlin and all the i um international logs in Europe, all hooked up into one instrument basically. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Did you? I thought it was a process and that it it wasn't included. Yeah. Yeah. Really? Well I would argue about that,you see, because I think that I mean th that you only extract that after you actually model a sp spectrum, don't you? Yeah. But, have a component though as such. Yeah, g um c Yeah, that's that's what I'm thinking, that It's actually really um after you actually model the s a spectrum, not just actually looking at the spectrum. Yeah, you think? Y Yeah. Yeah, but um component it is m means it's an element actually in the model though. Well uh The excesses, yeah. But um the component isn't. I think I would. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I I think actually pretty early on I'd have thought Where are they? Uh only just i Interesting because on the hour it yeah. No. No it is yeah. Well people do though, don't they? I mean it's pretty s stupid, but they do. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. If you're having ultra-loom this early on, then I think you have to have here. I don't think so. But t y are you arguing not to have anything with object in it though? So there goes And you s speed it up as well I think. So
Hmm. Did did you guys actually had sort of um the interaction or discussions while you we doing the annotation, did you have had stages of clarification or I suppose you did, right? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So did you feel that it was some some kind of some process of convergence, like that initially had quite different ideas about the phrase types and and markations and then eventually you came up uh with some kind of rules that you set up between uh the two of you? Or Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think so. Okay. I dropped a. So did Dere Derek and Ben has the um the file that they this manual? Or Yeah? O okay. Okay, right, it's printing it out as well. I actually haven't really thought about like uh marking or not marking, who's top and who's bottom. I think maybe that would make sense for you guys to know. I don't know. Yeah. Okay, fair enough. So so you sorry, um just for the convention, you you you marking which uh which the annotation you think is is the right one. Okay, fair enough. Mm-hmm, okay. Would there be other cases where you would actually mark an ab absorption? Or Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Cheers. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Is that the nebula? Was it the nebula thin Yeah. Um so so can I just ask w w now you just uh aligned d uh sorry, you circle the word in the in the outline which didn't Right, sorry. Ok oh, I see, okay. Mm-hmm. Cheers. I see. That was easy. The the I it it wouldn't count as a source type? Or Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Um sorry, can we just go back th uh one page? Did did you resolve the the li the different um segmentations, like uh the main problem was Oh sorry, I I thought it was a problem of like uh one having underlined the entire oh sorry. No no, I I se okay, sorry. Yeah, I see. So from the perspective the named entity recognition task, so I th I think th there there was also this one guideline of saying for example if something uh is sitting under a negation, right, the there was no um damped L_ Y_ alpha something, then um we then I think the convention was that we still that you still would mark that. Right, so it's more like uh a s it's uh uh it's uh sort of like a quite literal task that's really like finding these kind of uh these types of strings uh rather than really referring to the underlying physical reality, which I mean sort of like if if you if you were to resolve these kind of uh cases in order to put them say in a database or so, then you'd probably be right in this case, right. But uh th given that the kind of thing is that that this named entity recogn task is is a much is a much more uh literal thing. Like really just fin finding these kind of strings. I think in this case um I w I would say this is probably an entity. Yeah. Um so uh just about changing rules, I mean in a sense you also want to make sure that the annotation that that they the agreements that you arrive on today, that they're consistent with what you did before. Right, so uh I mean this really only displays uh th those cases where you disagreed. But if you sorta like change a rule now on the fly, then that might be then that might b uh create inconsistencies with the Yeah. Just out of curiosity, this narrow and broad band, that that refers to the type of spectrogram that you have? Like t on the type of filter or is it oh, okay. Yeah, okay. Mm-hmm. Oh, was it actually possible to doubly underline things? Um I don't know wh which one it would display then. I I actually didn't know that it was possible to have these so you you you allowed these kind of embedded uh annotations? Right, okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. That's pretty good, that's nearly a third.
Right. We did, yeah. Yeah, we did two of those, didn't we? I think we did two training sets and then we had at least one meeting with you where we talked it all through. Yes. Yeah. I'd say no, but I d I mean I thought we had basically the same ideas to b I don't remember ever having strong arguments about what should be in what group or it was just the rules about things that s yeah. And what counted as wha as for the spectral features it was more confusing what counted as a spectral feature, and we had a long discussion about that. But I don't remember sort of arguing from different sides and converging, just sort of piecing out what would come up and agreeing what we'd do. It probably would be, but I don't i it's been a long time, yeah, since we've done this. Yeah, that would be handy. Sign off. We did send it to him, yeah. Yeah. There's a cool little count-down clock that lets you know exactly how long you've been meeting as well. No, we don't at all. Yeah. But they're hardly in our areas. Uh Yeah, I did as well. No. It's a very strange interview feeling as well, because you can't see them while you're giving your talk, because they just show usually they have a camera on you and a camera on them, but during the talk part they have a camera on I believe them, 'cause I could see that guy reading a newspaper halfway through my talk. And then they had a camera on showing what my slides were, and so you forget that they can see you at all, and so when all that was over, they were answering me questions and the view switched again, I realised they were sitting there in the interview going. So Yeah. And you can't say looking over here. Like o. Yeah. Yeah. It is really strange. Mm. Excellent. Right. Shall w shall we dive in in the interim? Or Mm. No, you wouldn't do. I think I'm do I think I'm working out who's top and bottom. Um Yeah, I'm happy enough with that. I don't feel strongly about it. Ah. Ben said he he left it out on purpose, which is reason Yeah. I'm pretty sure I'm top. Uh Right. Right. Yeah, I think that's probably right as well. Okay, next. Okay. So here we're missing soft component on the bottom. There. If you get line I get soft component. Yeah. You can point to a soft component. Yeah. It's a big bump in the soft bit. It c uh yeah, I'm not fussed about that. They both mean the same thing. Yeah. This is the this is the thing you point to, yep. Yeah, that's the thing you point to and this is a ph a physical mechanism. So yeah, I'd say Two down. Two hundred and fifteen to go. Excellent. Mm that's definitely two. You're right. I think that's true. Alrighty. What are we missing? Broad line. Yeah, that's true. You get that. Uh I don't remember what we were doing with nebulae. We weren't doing like H_ two regions and stuff, were we? I can't remember actually. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Mm we were doing descriptions that made things separate classes, in which case I'd argue for elliptical I think. My God, I've just gone mad with the underlining here. Yeah, I. Yeah, that's the thing, but you wouldn't know it was a p yeah. The parallel index is something you desi derive. A break in a spectrum is something you can point at. So Yeah, b that thing there. And if I did it again, I'd say a slight depression of the continuum and possibly well, 'cause you can see both the slight depression and the Lyman limit. But we're supposed to say the descriptive words of the features. So Mm-hmm. Yeah, but they would be the same they'd both be the same spectral feature, whereas here they're two spectral features. There's a Lyman limit, which you could see, and then there's a slight depression near it. But Yeah. Do you have a sense about that? Yeah. Excellent. Yeah, okay. Uh-huh. That I didn't mark because it's the physical process of absorption. Not the the thing. Yeah, if it was there's an absorption feature or absorption to see it the spectrum at this wave-length. But when you say for example the the quasar is absorbed, that just means the quasar is behind a a bunch of stuff. So that's describing something physically rather than describing the spectrum itself. So Thank you. I don't remember what we were gonna do about things that weren't there. It's not something you can point to. You could point to it if it were there. Marked it, yeah. Yeah. Huh? Oh yeah. Yeah. What were we saying about nebula? Source types. No, nebula counts, doesn't it? Right. Yeah. Yeah, but that's line ratios. But Uh, line in in line in line ratios is modifying ratios. It isn't it? It's it's not talking about specific lines. A line ratio is a thing. Right.. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean you wouldn't you wouldn't include abundances or line strengths. Yeah, it shouldn't be in. I don't think. Whoop, no. Oh, I see what you're doing, you're circling the one we like, right. Oh sorry, um yep. Uh right, damped Lyman see again, that's uh these are source types, the um I mean it's not a source type. B But damped Lyman alpha absorbers are th are physical things, not spectral features. Ye But uh you wouldn't be able to point something in a spectrum and say that's a damped Lyman alpha absorber, unless you'd Yeah, you could do. But we wouldn't say absorbers were a type of source. Okay. I'm not certain about that, but I Hmm. But D don't with damped Lyman alpha observers you them a variety of places along the line of sight? So you have to know If you look at a quasar and you see a bunch uh if you got a bunch of clouds of gas in the way, you can see these things and but you wouldn't be able to point at one of them and say ah, that's a damp yeah. They're gonna be at different red-shifts. I don't know how they do th that. But Yeah. Ye Well no, but you see them in all sorts of different red red-shifts. It's like the the Lyman alpha forest, sort of. And I'm not certain I would I would mark that. It's a tricky one. Um no, I wouldn't, because it's they're physical things, not spectral features. You can't point at something on a spectrum and say that's definitely a d damped Lyman alpha some I g and I guess it's because they're modifiers of this source type, and we wouldn't mark that source type. We wouldn't mark absorbers, no. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm it's tricky one. Okay. Okay. But we weren't going to include s descriptions of spectral features that were based on fitting, were we? Have we? Steep soft component. Yeah, breaking the power law is something I'm not certain of. Steep soft component is something you can point at in a spectrum and say, there it is. Yeah. Yeah. It's tricky. Yeah. That's grand. Yeah. Yes. Um again I'd say this this is a physical process, not a spectral feature. Uh Yeah. Uh I don't have K_ star, but I should do. Wait, where Okay. What's wrong with broad H_ alpha? Right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's true, yeah. Yeah, that's true. Oh no, we're back to it again. That's true, but Lyman alpha forest clouds are source types we aren't marching marking. Which we don't mark, yeah. But we can just be consistent. And I don't think we are, 'cause that's not a spectral feature in the spectrum we're looking at. Yeah. But saying that isn't the same as saying we've seen that in a spectrum, whereas a broad line quasar, someone has looked at it and they've seen a broad line. But if you're discussing Lyman alpha forest clouds, they could just be discussing the physical object, which we aren't marking. Because they weren't I don't know. Anything blobby I di I didn't mark. Yeah. Yeah. I w I remembered not marking nebula or clouds or Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I think we just have to decide whether we're doing it. Yeah, but Bob's saying maybe we should be uh including nebula and clouds. But we haven't for the whole thing. Yeah. But that's 'cause we've to know it's a rather broad absorp absorption line object we have seen it. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Let's keep them. Nope. And here. Yep. Mm-hmm. There, that's derived, you're right. Oh, rubbish. Excellent. Uh you've got line brightness temperatures. Yeah. Yeah, we are. Yeah, I don't think line brightness temperatures counts. 'Cause it's not talking about a specific line. So Yeah. I don't think that counts. Feature. Right. Mm-hmm. Oh, no. Yeah, they're all the same. Yes, excellent. Um damped Lyman alpha again. Systems. That's a modifier of data. I mean that's that's a description of the type of data. A d I really don't think that counts. I wouldn't, but you would. I think just because it's got a spectral feature in the phrase, you wouldn't for example, when we were saying silicone two levels, we didn't mark silicone two. That's that's got nothing to do with the spectrum. But what this actually means is we've made some measurements based on damped Lyman alpha measurements, and they tell us this answer. And this answer is inconsistent with that answer. Yeah, I don't think that's right. Hmm? M I wouldn't, but because it's a modifier of data.. Oh feature, absolutely. B but Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Take it again, but systems should be out. Yeah. Mm 'kay. You've done it again. Yes. Right. Source type. Did we have a rule about this? Mm-hmm. Yep, that's true. That is true. Are we? Excellent. Just hitting the half an hour mark. See that i that's talking about the the flux of kin of ionising photons rather then the continuum of that spectrum. So I don't like that one. Oxygen abundance. Yeah. Mm. I'm happy enough with that. Blue-shifted. that's okay with me, I don't care. Yeah, you can have that as well. There you go. Next. Uh I think they are. I don't know why I did that. I don't like that at all. Yeah, could be that I was a bit sleepy. Lines from ions? You can't tell the difference between a line from an ion and a line line from something else. Well, you'd know where they are in the Well I guess yeah, I dunno. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's true. That's true. Alright. Yeah, but the feature itself is blue wing flux or if it was said blue wing feature, we'd mark feature. Hmm. Yeah. Possibly. Don't know. Ah uh You can point to it, but can you point to a line peak velocity shift? Well you can point to blue wing flux, 'cause you have your line and there's the blue wing flux. But if the line peak is increasingly shifted, you'd Mm there's a system issue again, so we should be consistent and keep it. Right? Yeah. Mm. Mm. I think I might agree with you. 'Cause this definitely shouldn't be marked. Because that is a process, not a A And if that shouldn't be marked, then that shouldn't be marked. Right. Oh okay. Mm. Yeah. Hmm yes. Okay. Yeah, I'm not sure either. But um. B oh yeah, either that if that shouldn't be in, neither should either of those. Mm yeah. A feature? What do you mean? Is it Uh We've marked thing have we marked things like Yeah, I don't know if we've marked things like silicone one throughout. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If we don't mark it though, we definitely shouldn't mark these two, should we? Do you agree with that? If that's true then their leaving out the word line I don't should mean that it shouldn't be marked. But But I mean, we know what they mean. Like Yeah, let's leave it in. Next. Uh Oh, is that what that means? Oh yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Seyfert two. Oh, yep. You're right. Radio loud counts, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That counts. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the and this shouldn't be, should it? M m does those count as modifiers active, we definitely include active. So It's a k kind of elliptical, is it? A E_ two is a kind of elliptical. What I don't know what the J_ means. Those can does that not mean a a broad band detection? And does that count? Uh H_ alpha detection. But don't we say we don't do that? Ah. I'm right, look. Don't include modifiers of regions or systems, E_G_ region, systems. That's why I wasn't doing it. G ah, look at that. Yeah, but b uh modifiers of regions or systems is the Yeah, we could always change this if we think we're right, rather than going back through and Based on this, but we could change this rule rather than changing all those things. What's the what was the appropriate thing to do at this point? Right. Right. Right. Yep 'Cause you might have followed that rule. Right. Alright. Um Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Damped Lyman alpha systems. Ah, we're back to damped Lyman alpha data. Okay. I I do I still don't think that goes in. But Yeah. I still don't like it. But I don't have passionate feelings. Yep. Yeah, just cross those out. Oops. Excellent. So what were we looking at this page for anyway? It was for something else, H_ alpha detection. Uh Broad band detections is in don't include. Oh, so it would be a narrow band detection, a narrow band imaging detection. Alright, good. No, they aren't. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah. Right. Uh, this is another systems thing. Okay. Yeah. No.. Um Yeah, absorption profiles I'll go for. Why not. Yeah, take out the blanketing. Has this Ah, right. Yep. Yeah, V_L_B_I_ is uh a net uh it's it's a V_L_B_I_ is it's a technique. It's not a yeah. What's it's called something else, isn't it? The V_O_ Yeah, it's called a V_L_B_A_. This is V_L_B_I_ network image. So do they mean the V_L_B_A_. European V_L_B_I_ net. Is it in it it's an intstru group instrument, not a research group. Yeah. Yeah. It's only supposed to be proper names. But I don't Yeah, is that so this whole thing is an instrument, you say. Oh. Oh, I see, I see. Yeah. So is this like it's a subset of the V_L_B_A_? Right. Cool. Right. Oh. That is a source name, you're right. Yeah, that's just Mm-hmm. We say something about objects, and I think it's that we don't use it. Ye Yeah, but we shouldn't have done. So that's it, yeah. Yeah, that's fair enough. It's certainly not a source name. Yeah, that means that's a proc it's a process or it's a it's a type of photons, that's not the continuum you're looking at. Sure you can, yep. Mm nope. Neither should that. Excellent. Have we agreed on that? We only agreed that so far we've only agreed that we can't include spectral features modifying nebula, but I don't see yet where it's written down that you can't mark nebula. Yeah. Yeah, but the see there's so many different kinds of nebula. I think is why I wasn't doing it. Yeah. If we're going to have them, let's have them. What's different? Oh, yeah. Um, don't mind. Mm-hmm. You're right. There. Source type. Line blanketing. Sh I no, I don't think I did I? So that yeah. Did we? Ah Um We did just have it, don't know. It wasn't that far back, was it? No, it wasn't that far back. Line yeah, we took blanketing out, so I don't think that should be in. Is that it? Yeah. Uh that's a source nine. Isn't it? Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm right. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Mm the soft excess you can definitely point to on an X_ ray thing. You kn you know if there's one there or not, you could say that's that. So You're saying you wouldn't know it was soft unless you'd w oh yeah. I see what Mm. But results from spectral. Give that for red and blue components, but I wouldn't probably give that for soft component. Because a soft excess is a uh I mean that's an X_ ray thing. Like a break, you say oh look, there's Mm. Yeah. Yeah, I'd take out red and blue. Which means maybe we should take out soft. But it's such a basic sort of you look at a spectrum and you say that's a a soft excess, it's a soft Yeah. It's just a t Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's probably true, yeah. Um Hubble and Hubble deep sent to us. Yeah. Yeah. So should w did we have a soft component earlier? So we sh should kill it. No. Yeah. There it is. Right. Alright. Mm d yeah, okay. Yeah, that's fine, I'm happy with all that. Yeah.. Yeah, that counts. Do we ha did we s make a decision about radio galaxies? 'Cause I think they are discussed as a separate source type, aren't they? radio galaxies? It hides that, yeah. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Yeah. Where part of it's useful. I think you're supposed to mark the whole thing, aren't you? Yeah, so you're right. Um It's a sub-classification of Seyfert's. would make a s study Seyfert one point eights. Oh do they? You're right, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Uh yep. Yeah, galaxy and galaxy formation doesn't count. And yes, that counts. But in Yeah. Right, but I'm on the Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I don't think that should go in. Don't mind. Oh, up here. Yeah. Mm. Is it? Or is it oh, right. And Q_S_O_ is not yeah, you're right. Yep. The I_S_M_ isn't a source type. Is it? We're now including nebula, aren't we? Mm what have we done, features. Mm yep.. Okay. Nope. Yep. We aren't doing emission line objects. Oh no, we aren't doing that either, you're right. Mm no. They aren't, are they? Yeah. Yeah, anything to do with objects. So nothing. Yeah. Yes.",EN2006a
"Yeah. Could you ju just quickly rewind? Yeah. Okay. Oh. Okay. Okay. Oh. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No no. Wait wait. It's going very fast for me actually. thing actually. It's very fast. So wha first point the first thing you told me that you took the slides and you was and you had a l big dictionary and you are seeing uh what what are the inside the slide, right? Uh what the 'cause I first statement I could not understand. Uh when you said the the st uh uh the s uh the w yeah, so we what's so yeah, so could you please tell me little bit more in detail? Yeah. No no no, don't go that. I I want the no, I want to understand what did you mean by the wo uh the te uh thing like saying that I took a dictionary and then a word from the slide and what you are looking for. I could not understand clearly clearly that. Mm mm-hmm. Okay, but do how do why do you want certain words. Like wha how do you expect that certain words? Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It appears in almost uh uh it is if it appears in all the slides it says a hundred percent correlation for me. One percent well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Are like that. Okay.. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, it's independent of each other. Okay. Okay, fine, that's fine, that's uh uh uh s certain words it should. You have to Okay. Fine. Now I'm uh okay. I'm into the loop. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Context. But it is implemented on the A_S_R_? Or uh where? Okay. Okay. Oh okay. Yeah. Else interpolate, extrapolate. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you mea so uh you mean to say that um like when one case you were saying that if you include the context and all those thing it helps in your A_S_R_ improvement, but it doesn't, which more subjective I think this whole Yeah. Uh-huh. Yes. Yeah. Mm. Mm yeah, you can do that, yeah. Or it could Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. So you so you so okay. So maybe like it can be uh something like in a meeting it can be like an unusual scenario for you, in a presentation with a slide. And the unusual scenario that you're not using the uh slide at all. Mm-hmm. Yeah. What are the other slide, yeah. We have plenty of things to do. What track? Yeah. Go on. Yeah, it's no problem. Okay. So uh well so ultimately now the next step what is that? Because I want like kind of a uh so at first you said that okay now you did this. This correlation studies. And they show that there's a very less correlation or in fact no correlation kind of thing. And uh um uh so uh so what next in on top of it what you are going to build I mean is the question now. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, so t I mean to the different direction now that's what I mean to say. What you like to take from there. Uh it's not defined yet, okay. Mm-hmm. But what kind of problem? We need a definition of some kind of uh problem, right? Uh yeah.. Yeah. No, no, no. No but yeah, direction. Yeah, that's that is a thing. We go on to the next direction. It should not that i it should not happen that you're doing so many things and ultimately it doesn't goes into a thesis. The that's that should not the problem. Your thesis should be w in one direction. One problem. And uh should go uh in one or uh one d yeah. It it doesn't make sense. Uh the it may be good as a C_V_ for you, but then as a thesis you will have problems uh defending it and all those things. So what is that uh what would be the next possible direction you want to take. Uh Error measure. It's yeah. Yeah, exactly. Mm. S see that is going to tell us uh something like uh wha the thing is that i uh it it see you can totally go into the text domain and be there, you know? It can be s no problem. But as long as uh it is okay. But if you want to do with uh s like certain something with the speed and all those things together then it's a different scenario. Uh you may not want to work on all the problems. Someone may work on some other problem. But then you you make use of that to extend your work in some. And uh and as I also t it depends like also like I think if uh boss is interested in working in both speech and text, you can understand very well. That part is also there. No, the boss. Like have a it's like instead of saying like you should like work on both side, you know, the text and the speech aspect of it. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh w one thing interesting is what we came up in the discussion also you about telling that uh detecting such scenarios where there is no relation between the slide and the person talking, that may be one good starting point for you actually. And then at that point y uh you detect something like that and then you show something like uh what you are saying that i if there is uh if uh there i if it is out of discussion, the words are no way are going to help your recognition anyway, A_S_R_. But if it is more on the um the slide information is not going to help you. But uh if it is uh if it is related to the sli what he is giving a presentation on the slide then you show the your A_S_R_ if you detect this even then you can show that how where you can really help or not help. Because you say there's no correlation now. But then here it comes that there at some point there might be a correlation there. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. So okay.. Mm-hmm. Mm. Oh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The th sides and the talk. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Like another mic. Th yeah, most of the most of the time you have the title to do, no. The AMI dat the AMI data what that like that only most of the time you knew they had the word. The word you are going to present. Everyone is presenting the same set of slide. Yeah. What about M_L_M_I_? W the one we collected last year. Audio is very bad, right? Yeah. uh one single channel or at least a closed channel collection, no. Okay, okay, okay. It was good. Tha tha tha that Uh okay. So they are is there are still using that uh desktop microphone or what over there. Or Uh Ah. Okay. Okay. That's fine, yeah. Yeah. It's a. Yeah it's a Yeah, I understand. Okay, so now there be uh would be some time wh what is we should be getting a time recording system, right? That uh uh uh so Mm. Okay. Lapel. Should be okay. No, it it's it's uh quite a bit, yeah, problem, to do that kind of thing. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, but probably we were the f you know, the post uh the the thing is somewhere projector. Suppose there's like the the white-board or whatever, the presentation is over there, the speaker is more probably is going to this way or that way. So probably you you may not need a very big microphone either. Probably one or two. uh uh ye uh yeah. Uh yeah. Hmm. Yeah. No the they the the the CHIL may be interesting for you. But it's a l uh well yeah, it may be interesting for your problem, I think. Y yeah. No no no. Yeah. Yeah, it's more like TAM. But uh yeah. The the their collection is much uh uh like they have uh R_T_N_s and all those thing. People sitting and uh it's a lec it's a lecture uh a meeting collection. And I uh is it through n n uh L_D_A_ or something. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So so probably we can yeah. CHIL may be interesting actually. You can look at it. In the text. Mm. Well but uh S Yep. Hmm. Mm-hmm. That's that's a yeah. That that they have. Mm. They're talking fast. I had a problem I like find the answer for my own. Yeah. So what about the figure things? What happens if there's a figures coming on the slide? So what do you want to do with that? On the s uh-huh. Either stop it Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Usually in products and resources. Okay, so what are you going to do between the data when you collect and this? What do you want to do now? By the time you get the data it's going to take another two months if I am right, the whole capturing system when it is going to come. So what is the next step? Yeah, you have to submit it in like two months also again. Yeah, yeah, to submit, yeah. It's one year, right?. For sure. You you need it bad. Call routing where. That's inte. I think we should yeah. This is yeah. Uh h oh. Yeah. Mm yeah. Mm yeah. Uh uh Uh yeah. Yeah. Even if little bit of. Oh. This Uh ye yeah. Yeah. No no, I think you yeah, it's uh it's huge. Yeah. It it it's non-determinist. Yeah, that's what we expect to Yeah. Exa that's the intention there. Sure. Mm ye. No, no, no, no, no. It i Yeah. Surely they should they should have had that actually. So maybe like we had to do this end point detection and probably a little bit of final filtering. And then I think you should be pretty much converging to the system. But the still the reason with the the they had like what are the systems we train on databases are they are chop neatly. That there is not too much silence beginning, not too much silence at the end. They are they are j they they chopped so neatly for the it like custom made database. But uh here it's not like that you know like uh-huh. Yeah. There are the several things. Like one thing is like we can do this begin and end detection, as we said. Or you and he can uh we can try to use uh France Telecom's uh approach actually. And that um uh uh they they have this front end which uh uh which which can do a spectral. And plus it can give you a voice activity detection. Part f part from basis it can give. So somethi we can just yeah, we can just run it quickly and see. And probably you will have to run it. Will give you the idea that is it okay like? Yeah. No no no no. Uh not running, I mean to say p probably uh he should run it or uh like we can ge help him to run it actually. Because at some point he has to get into Uh I mean to say I I mean to say that it's okay. We have all the scripts. But probably uh he should run it I mean to say. It's a The all these experiments probably Uh the they are uh the scri because up to uh probably maybe we shall do mm it yeah. Uh for to make it faster we should ru it run maybe. If we run f we ourself it it's very fast. Uh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm okay. No, but I mean to say that if you if you if you if you if you give him the scripts and ask him to run, uh the Uh no. Yeah. But it's Uh Yeah. Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that uh-huh. No no no no, I the end point system is different thing, no? That's and we need it for AMI plus other thing. And so but the I am to all saying yeah. I I am. It's n it uh no no no, it's not speech non-speech. Uh uh it's uh it's uh it's yeah. Yeah. Any anything nonsense or else it beeped. It's not silent. It's uh you can say that's very yeah. And it can be it can be anything. Yeah. Breathing. Yeah. No anyway, so we okay, so we'll finish this call routing stuff. What do you say all thi this is okay with you, right? So we'll k because I think uh it it it has not been even submitted outside also the work what Jean-Yves did yet. Mm yeah not done that yet. Tried Uh yeah, he still yeah. Uh-uh. Yeah. So yeah, it it's pretty much good time also, no? And he c he can and uh when do you intend to start writing the proposal? Probably you should start, I think. S slow. Little bit start thinking. No no, you you should not wait till the end. That's what I mean to say. Uh yes,. Because you Because it Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh. Yeah, it can go there, yeah. See No, no, no. I think it's uh it's good if he submits his pr proposal. As a research report you put here, submit it for the conference. It's quite good for the proposal directly. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think uh we we may have to like it can have a uh it's it's kind of like uh uh maybe take like uh uh two or three days, you know, like to sit out and say uh one converge to one approach and then just do without that yeah. And probably yeah. So that is the thing. We have to sort out the bug kind of thing and see how reliable is this end point detection for us. Yeah, mm-hmm. Uh yeah, I think uh then we can go back to C_T_S_ actually. Yeah. Okay. And uh yeah, so that is this. So you wanted to talk something more than that. Well we obstructed you with that. You wanted to talk something different also. No. Or maybe another meeting. And then I say I don't remember.. No, I was just looking this. Okay uh we are not out of time, you know. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's happened uh it happened with my friend. Like uh he was taking pictures pictures pictures and it was going thirty seven, thirty eight, forty even.. So I said there's some problem with yours uh your uh uh the way he uh put the roll inside. There is some problem, it has got stuck somewhere. It can never go to forty one, forty Yeah, I uh uh thirty seven, thirty eight is fine. forty, forty one is but see, he has already. Don't listen. Okay.
Thanks. Yeah. Yeah.. Um a little bit, but uh I'm m I'm not sure he knows uh everything. So uh basically uh well, first we tried to um explain why in this uh resc uh N_ best list re-scoring uh from the slides to enhance the speech recognition on the meetings data is not working. So um uh that's one thing. And uh so what we did with Alessandro is uh um ch t uh performing some statistical tests to see whatever r if the if the words uh the the appearance of the words during the meeting is uh in independent of the ap appearances of the different slides. So the in the case if it is dependent that would mean that certain words tend to appear during certain slides and that there is a correlation and uh then there will be uh a reason like for believing that uh this will work. The resu the result was no. Yeah, true. Yeah, almost nothing. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Huh. So Matthew we were uh yeah, it's uh we were talking that we did some experiments to see if the word during meeting the words appear independently of the slides in a sense that uh if certain words tend to appear during certain slides or no. And uh the answer is uh no. And uh so we did a statistical test for that. And I will add also that we did that on the uh w the words after filtering them from the removing the the stop words. Yeah, so uh so uh bec s because yeah, with the stop words okay th there would be a reason for uh in independence because there is uh such a huge mess of them. But uh even uh after removing them uh there it it remains uh independent. And actually uh so when I was doing the re-scoring experiments, I was doing that on uh one meeting that I selected as being like the best looking one. Uh it ha it had the m the most uh slides. And now I did the same uh on uh the other meetings which were available where well it's only three meetings because well here there are four of them which are from the test set uh from the AMI recogniser w but only three of them have uh slides. So it's total of three meetings and for the others the tendency and I c 'cause you know I was when I was doing re-scoring, I was uh taking into account the for one given slide also the n neighbouring slides. And as I was in increasing the number of slides which were affecting the the utterance I was re-scoring um the performance was improving sli s uh slightly. Very very little. But uh Yeah. Uh the the first thing we are talking about ex the experiment to see the uh if it's dependent or independent. How we did it? Uh so we used the Pearson uh chi square uh test no. Ah okay. It was to to see if uh certain words have a tendency to appear during uh uh they if they are more likely to appear during certain slides. W Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the answer to that was no. And s so when extending the those experiments to the other meetings uh when while I was observing an improvement on the first meeting I was using, uh so I was r observing an improvement as I was increasing um like the um the context. Yeah. Uh On the on the recognition, yeah. So there was uh the improvement was also increasing as I was increasing the context, while on the other meetings it's um it's it's it's really fluctuating and uh i it it uh it looks more like um uh ps uh well, what's the word for that? Statistical um um fluctuation. So uh Mm-hmm. Huh. Mm-hmm. Exactly. So that's why um uh if we look on the relationship that uh exists between the speech and the slides, uh the task of improving the recognition, uh the overall um sp uh speech recognition using the slides uh seems to be uh uh not very uh um good. I mean um we cannot expect much from from it. Mm well for now the uh most effort was uh on uh um showing why i it's i it's it will not work. Especially those experiments and these uh statistical tests. But uh we w were thinking for example of a task like um trying to uh see if uh where a speaker is talking I mean if the speech is actually correlated with the slides uh where the slides uh which happen during the not correlated, but if the Uh well if the um If the speaker is actually talking about what is in the slides or not. Indicator. Yeah, or for example uh what happened for example in one of the meetings is that p people were um summarizing the the results of the previous meeting, you know. So in the beginning so the meeting started with the summary of what happened uh previous time and this was not related to what was on the slides. Link uh But this is one yeah. Huh. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was recycling uh kind of. Task. Huh. Huh. Even summarization. Or Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Uh no. No. But for the other thing, you know uh uh the alternative measures. Or maybe we should finish with this first. Uh I mean uh Yeah, this uh this would be a f uh another subject I would like to discuss. S but uh w but uh uh basically ju just, you know, if we finish uh discussing this first. Mm-hmm. This is not clearly defined yet. But uh um something um using this relationship uh between the slides uh and other even other tek textual support and the uh and the speech. Huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, sure. Well, this is um the question I'm working on. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Yeah, that that could be interesting to try to merge those two uh things. Uh yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, and I um uh Are they are interested in that or no? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, yep. Yeah, that's what what is missing. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. No.. AMI meeting. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. It's a first step. Hmm. Hmm. And we could uh do automatical uh speaker rating if there are good speakers or bad speakers depending if they just read uh Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Maybe possible someday. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well uh did trying to really determine the um the um uh subject of something for my proposal I mean. Yeah, aro around February or March. So really um Yeah. So to find something for that. Uh also with the th thinking maybe turning this uh work into publication, the one about the for sure. And uh also uh uh well that uh depends a little on on on you. But try to finish with the um measures and the call routing. 'Cause I was talking with that uh about that to Herve uh since I was uh I will recycle this poster for I_M_ two, you know, about uh about this. And uh that could be cool to to finish it. Maybe fuse it with uh Ian's work and uh do a journal paper he was suggesting. So so you're so what you are saying is that you you noticed that when you um tried other features and uh Because and initially it was a s Nuance, trained on Nuance, uh no? Or Mm-hmm. Run run run what exactly? For the the the call routing itself or the recognition uh the phoneme recognition? Yeah. I have all uh Jean-Yves's uh scripts and uh programs for performing the call uh routing I think uh starting from the phoneme sequences. Yeah, I I know that I don't know how to use the cluster. Yeah, if it's just running a script I don't know if it's But this is basically detecting speech and no non-speech. Yeah. It's this uh problem I hear every time on the speech meeting how do we detect speech and not speech. Ah and uh Or oh okay. It's not just speech and silence. It's speech and and okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But who really can do uh when somebody will really be able to do that, I mean detect the speech from non-speech, it will be a little revolution, no, in the Mm-hmm. Yeah, well this is basically in my three uh main jobs uh proposal uh um this. Ah yeah, yeah. Yeah but yeah. Ah yeah sure. But uh uh uh shouldn't make it clearer before on the on the on what uh I I will write. And even uh a first uh uh submission using this work um will make things clearer for me uh writing them down and f for it will help I think for that also. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well I think uh first uh this submitted and this will help for the proposal. And since uh we cannot start immediately with the measures, I think that's the best thing to do. Mm well no. Well for me it's I think we uh it's fine. Yeah and I think uh that will be exactly one hour and uh uh fill the tape. Uh the tape is sixty minutes. Ah so I was right. Ah yeah. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.
Okay, we start waiting for people coming late and uh I can say this because in this moment you cannot answer because you don't have the microphone. So I can say whatever and you cannot reply. So yeah.. Ye In my opinion it is no because of the nature of the language. I mean intuitively of course you tend to use more the words that are on the slide., But the mass of the words actually you use are words that are common. Just think that fifty percent of the words on average whatever corpus you take are stop words, articles, et cetera. So in terms of recognition fifty percent goes away. Of the rest uh remaining fifty percent I mean are all words that appear one, two, three times. So in any case even if actually and they tend to be uh related or a statistically related to a single slide, in any case in terms of uh recognition do not help at all, or help a very little. So uh that's the kind of thing uh I mean that's the kind of measure, the ind statistical independence is not on single words. Is overall, which basically means in terms of recognition that doesn't help. Hmm. You know, even if actually I remember I just made some measure uh saying okay l let's look at how many words I don't have in the dictionary and are in the slides. It was two percent. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. So some in some sense it intuitively it sounds very good. But in practical terms, in terms of recognition uh here we we we have to be clear. If you want to improve the recognition, that im improves very slightly. Uh it is different if you want to have other tasks where the only words that all are words. In that case, even the slight improvements uh he gets at that point, they can make the difference. But does the recognition And some way the statistical independence I think it can be a good explanation to show why it is happen even if it is counterintuitive. But that's that's what happens basically. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Be be b be careful, it's not exactly this because for sure there are words that tend to be. So the point is you want to verify whether you can improve the recognition rate by using as an information the words that uh are contain in the slides. So basically the idea is that uh in the moment you are in the slide somewhere your language change accordingly to the slide. So the fact of having that information somewhere can help you to improve the recognition. But actually it's not what happens. And this does not happen for many reason. First, for example, fifty percent of the words in any kind of text are stop words. So are everywhere. And the remaining a appear so little, that in the case cannot really improve that much. Most of the words we use actually whatever we talk about are common uh words. So how to verify this? I mean this is something that has been measured et cetera but still is a bit qualitative. To have a quantitative measure, mm-hmm, we simply did uh a measure of statistical independence between the words in general, so not some words, the words in general. Otherwise you can see that if a words appear once, basically it is one hundred percent related to one slide, huh? But you have to i if you want to consider in terms of recognition performance,you have to make it overall. I mean what is important is not the word that appear once, it's the word that appear If uh i exactly. If if there is one word that appear once all over the meeting, it appears in correspondence of one slide, then of course it seems to be very related. But very few words uh they represent a very little part of the word mass, mm. So we simply used a very old test, statistical test, that basically measure the hypothesis that some way the probability of having one word in correspondence of a certain slide is simply the product of the probability of the word for the probability of the. That's it. So that's what we did. But is in general the language and not certain words. Because certain words for sure have a strong dependency on the slides. But there are l few. Yeah. Fluctuations? Mm-hmm. It is not in terms I mean for me for example it was not in the sense that uh after working a little bit on language you realise that this kind of thing do not help simply because most of the words uh have nothing to do specifically with the subject you use. Uh most of the words we use uh that's strange, but are simply necessary to build a sentence. There are very few uh content uh words. But it is true that intuitively uh as we are driven in our attention uh I mean in in our understanding we're pretty much driven by attention, that we tend to spot only those words. Exactly, and in some sense intuitively it seems that it can happen, I mean this is not the first attempt to do things like this and it never works actually i in terms of recognition. For other task it can be uh it can be uh helpful. Yeah. Yep. Be careful. Correlate is a dangerous word in statistic. It seems to be the opposite as before. The. Or roughly. Basically uh one thing it can't be done. And and here uh on the contrary for example the few words that are mm how may I say it recognized more can really make the difference. It isn't the case if you want to see if uh I mean what if seen in the meeting and that okay. There are presentation. Then yeah, still the slide is there. But actually the people talk about other things. Or not really other things but the slide is no longer uh a support for the discussion, huh? There are moment that actually this is the support because the people describe, et cetera. And there are moment where it is not. Is a just a background uh thing. And we rough estimated very quickly. But it was one third of the time. At least in in the meeting we have seen. The slide were just there I mean but they were no longer use as a support. It was a discussion rather between people. So in that case the presence or the absence and especially the frequence with which you observe the words that are on the slides can be an excellent uh uh clue, huh. Indication, a clear indication, whether actually does it support of the discussion or not. Uh It can be this. It can be interpreted as a kind of focus of interest. It can be simply interpreted in the sense of saying uh okay I mean you have this channel open there. Do I have to p taken into account or not? Or also in terms of action, yeah uh when you see that s the discussion is completely m disconnected with respect to this some way uh it means that it's happen in something different than before. So I mean it's a kind of feature that in my opinion can be easy to detect it and um that can, yeah, uh f can be interesting to do. Relatively easy to do. And uh in that case, for example, the few words mm that you that you get more can make the difference. Oh so is that mm double way to to show how some way dependent on the task. What do you mean exactly? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Some way well there are f yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm hmm. Yeah, I know, this we are s s talking about today short term if you want. Uh things just to the use the things. I mean all the work they that has done basically, which is a huge work. And the data we have then uh enough for the for a thesis of course it must be much better. But of course the there's only two two different kinds of words. Some of them you can do it on a single meeting. So this kind of feature extraction because basically that's what it is, saying yes no this channel is good. Now is background. Now is foreground, et cetera. You can put it in that in that way. This you do it on a single meeting. And then there are corpus um based um how may I say it works so yeah, that is one possibility for example, finding the connection between different meetings. Then I don't know, I mean at that point it becomes pretty much crucial the kind of uh data you have in the sense that for the way we have collected the data some way I don't know if it can be at the same time too easy in the sense that some way you have little groups of meetings extremely correlated. So I mean it it makes it easier. I mean I don't know how much significant can be at that level. It can be I in a sense, if you want uh this kind of words become interesting when the corpus is really big uh uh when when you when you consider each meeting as a single item. So it's interesting when you have tens, hundreds, thousands of meetings, which is not the case. But I mean you can do other work if you consider in terms of speaker turns or in terms of slides, and that is immediately multiply. Yeah. Yep, yep. That is another So it can be one more feature that helps in but it is very short-term. I mean just uh well it is ju just few few few times we talk together and it was just, mean, the very quick thing you can can have uh like this. Mm-hmm. But I think in a sense in my opinion well there are two things. When this uh statistical test it can be we have made an experiment we get a result somewhat counter-intuitive we give an explanation. And uh that's it. I mean that's that's something that some way closes here. So when it gives you the kind of answer you get is that okay to go in that in that direction maybe is not the best thing. Maybe to improve the recognition that way is not uh something you can expect. So it gives the possibility to decide to go uh in a different direction that can be more on this uh let's say. This is Hmm. Mm-hmm hmm. Well uh I think the advantage eventually w I mean the advantage with this kind of things is that are much easier. Gaze tracking is still Just with the environment is a difficult thing. I mean it requires cameras with pretty good quality, et cetera. Uh but I think his question is more uh general. A and it says so I mean based on this work, do you figure out uh a direction if they guess correctly. Uh a domain, a direction for your thesis for your exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. One domain, yeah. Not a collection of little uh things completely unrelated. But uh That's very Mm-hmm. Yeah. M but still doesn't solve the problem of saying what I yeah yeah, sure sure. What I what you are going to do for your thesis. I mean as Herve said, I mean basically if you have to explain in four lines what will be the topic of my thesis, the subject of my thesis. And it is something that is not just saying I'm going to do uh this this this and that. I mean because this we actually don't know. But yeah, in a very broad sense I mean w what you're going to investigate, what kind of uh If I interpret correctly. Then uh one basic thing I suggested even thinking about I mean is exactly this stru all these scenarios that can be a meeting, that can be presentation where you have a s a relationship between speech, between things that are said and uh some textual documents some way. Why not try to to to to study this relationship, to improve this relationship, to use this relationship for um mm whatever it is, indexing or annotation or whatever, meta-data extraction. And if you want for example this little work uh about seeing when the slide channel is background and foreground is not beginning of this kind of thing. So a relationship between two channel that provide some kind of information. Mm-hmm. Sure. Sure. Sure, sure, sure, sure. Mm-hmm. No no, be careful. For the recognition in general there is no correlation in the sense that even if you're talking about what is on the slide, most of the words you use most of the words you use are not really correlated to that. Are simply words. And consider also that we all speak English here. And apart of uh native English speakers we have a very limited vocabulary in general. So we tend to use always the same words. But on average, you know, linguistic research shows that on average the people use five hundred words. That's what we have a disposition. And we say everything uh yeah. We say everything with that. And probably we, not a native English speaker, we use even less. So that's gives an idea of why basically in terms of recognition it doesn't really help because you always use anyway the same words. And a few occurrences of words that are there in terms of recognition make one, two percent. So maybe it's not enough to justify uh an effort to improve the recognition. Then you can change of task and use a task, the task we were mentioning about the back channel or foreground channel. In that case the only words that really are important are those words that appear on both slides. At that point, I mean, a little improvement of that, it becomes a big improvement. I mean maybe in terms of recognition it's zero point five percent. But in terms of that task is maybe twenty percent. Yeah. Yeah. That's another interesting point. I mean we are using data that are fake. Any uh in any case they are simulation, no real data. And especially the slides. I think I've seen those slides. I mean they are pretty much artificial. Exactly. But but not pre-prepare. But Yeah, but Yeah, I yeah, I mean uh everything is pretty much artificial. That that's what I mean. So you mention for example this uh fact that sometimes uh speakers tend to read. This is especially true when you have bullet list, huh. Sometimes people really go through. It didn't happen in the data simply because uh uh it was not the same people prepa uh exactly. Ah? So for example it will be possible in any case because the Herve's infrastructure is ready and now we are going to collect the presentation. There maybe we can see The audio is is is very bad. I I thing is really You know, that was collected m a little bit like this without uh too much care. It was it was uh a personal effort of Mael that decided to do it. It was really good to do it. It was very good. But basically it was made without any specific um,you know, without thinking we want to recognize, just to have them. So the especially the audio channel is absolutely awful. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh that's uh that's that is one of the reason for example why which uh mark we point pretty much on slides as a mean of indexing. Because at that point there is no interaction between humans and capture. Because whenever you have microphones that you have to move, it's it's it becomes complete uh really Yeah. We are building this slowly. I mean it's it's unfortunate. I mean is is is taking time for the material and so on. But yeah. There will be this. Uh it will be one camera pointing very general but just for display purposes essentially. One uh microphone. And we are thinking to use uh lapel microphone, you know, this this thing. And so that potentially helpful hopefully helpful to to do recognition. And to slides through the projector. Wo Let's say that uh in any case uh w well there are two reason. First of all we are trying to do something that can be easily the the the idea is really it's something that you take you bring somewhere else and it works. So it must be as easy as possible. But in any case I mean the device we are doing has input channels. So some way you can add as many input as we want. So we are dealing now with three. But there are other input uh lines open. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Although at that point we can use this. I mean I was mention the the lapel microphone mm just like this. But if you tell me this, that's very interesting because at this point we can use this kind of things. But I don't why why not uh so there will be other data, their test data. Uh and especially for this kind of problem I think it can be a much more useful kind of data because there is real presentations. I mean is it's reality. You know, it's it's it's uh y n it it it it's exactly. It's more realistic and um yeah, probably it can help go in this direction of saying well let's see what happen between speech and slides. Uh Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Okay, that is cool. Yeah, yeah. That's cool. Uh yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's a it's a European project anyway. So I guess uh it must be available somewhere. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. M Yeah, mm-hmm. But only we're measuring one third. It's not At least in no, I'm uh talking now about um the meeting. How presentation, of course. On presentation it it should be one hundred percent, yeah. Yeah yeah yeah, of course. No, that is just something that in my opinion uh with the work that's been already done is something we can get pretty quickly. It's an interesting task. It's more specific on uh meetings. Certainly not for uh for presentation. And it represent a nice task that can be measured, that is clear and Mm yeah. Yeah. Uh i in terms of actual recognition can of course uh help. So it's it's uh but of course not going to be it's not going to be a kind of thesis about this. No, that doesn't make any sense. I mean That uh, in a sense, if you want I mean that that's at least the way I see the that list I have made for my own thesis. I mean uh you define that domain I mean which is uh large, I mean which can be very general. So interaction between uh speech and slides, cool. And then you see how all these things, this two little works, or the statistical independence. And detecting when it is uh are two little works that some way fit in that very general uh framework. Shown from this point of view it n that things mm there are other things, for example one that I really would like to do which is kind of fun. So when you have a bullet list can I click on one of the bullet and get the piece of speech where the guy was talking about that. Because sometimes people just read. Sometimes people uh im improve is more uh so for example that what that's another thing that fits in that kind of uh mm framework. And that's interesting in terms of uh I mean first of all again is measurable in terms of browsing, in terms of retrieval, in terms of indexing, annotation, meta-data extraction. That can be applied in many That would be you know, that uh that's uh that's something uh you're maybe joking now. That's something that can uh be done for example. And uh some way there are parameters that can be measured that tell you that following certain uh criteria uh there is one very easy for example. I had the the the sp there are speaker that never look at the audience. Those are bad speakers in general. It's very wrong. You have to look at the audience. This is one. There is for example, and this is something that eventually can be done. If you have a certain number of words on your slides you need a certain amount of time to read them. The speakers that take a time which is too close to that, they are not good speaker because some way uh um they're talking too fast. They are not uh Yeah, they are not giving you the time. And there is a certain number of things that can be uh some way detected and measured that tell you whether the speaker is actually respecting some form of uh uh. It's a bit uh of having difficult and uh I would not um go that much in that direction. I mean it's uh but you know you know uh Figure, you know Tables, number. Ah, visual things. Well, that's for example with uh we submitted a project with J Jean-Marc um to use that thing as meta-data. And basically one thing for example we're trying to do and and again, this is something that can fit, huh. It will be not uh maybe. But but uh if you get the project, et cetera in any case it's something that Jean-Marc and me we want to do. Uh based on the kind of graphic object you have, so tables, questions, uh figures, plots, et cetera the side one for example, it is a result. Try to get so that's again in terms of structuring, browsing, structure and retrieval, okay when it is a result. When it is an introduction. When it is uh Yeah. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Uh Um It's not really true. It's not really it's not really true. Yeah, yeah, it's not really true. Yeah, that's o it's one of the most funny thing, I mean you can see when you work in this thing. Each one of us has an idea and then it's not true at all. I mean s some people actually are stick very carefully. If the p if they put in the outline uh let's say title one, title two, then you'll you find title one, title two. But many other people, and I am one of those people for example, are much more general. So my outline is something like introduction and experiments, the results, conclusions. You don't find the same title in the slides. It's it's really a different style of uh there are people that don't put, for example, outline. We were uh for example in the um corpus of M_L_M_E_, so the one is on the demo. Fifty percent of the presentation have no outline. In the corpus of the TAM two thousand four, TAM presentation, twenty five percent of the presentation have no outline at all. That's that's uh what yeah, uh w it is. And basically that's that's uh and again, the outline is typical maybe in scientific presentation. Well in that case that majority has. Other kind of presentation probably no. I mean it's it's an habit we have. But um you but again uh I mean unfortunately th n there is nothing true. Nothing true, is is everything is chance pretty much. So uh that was on on possible work. Mm-hmm. Not maybe. For sure. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I see. I know. Yeah yeah. I know, I know, I know. I see. And so essentially say well as there is this silence time which tend to be even more than than how it is, so better to have a kind of silence detection. So something that really takes this and they recognize only that uh that part. This will improve the phoneme uh recognition rate. That's what it of of course, of course, of course. And at that point, even the uh call router that uh Jean Jean-Yves has uh made can improve uh its performance. And it can be used after uh tool for the measure work. Uh That we got. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sure, sure. Then oh yeah yeah yeah. I know. I know the problem. I see. I see. I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I see. I see the problem. I'm not not sure it's. Yeah. I'm losi No. No. Mm-hmm. Mm.. No no. Basically because it was not at uh at a level that could be anyway. So the idea was good. I think, yeah, with a better uh phoneme recognition rate definitely it could uh improve also the the call routing performance. Nope. But we can we can find. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. But we can some way find a guy. I mean this should should be have all details, so it should be relatively easy to at least this is the last news I had and then I can try to get him back. Uh Yeah. No, going very pra pragmatic uh there is a submission uh deadline for example thirty one December for conference on multi-media and expo where I think these two little works on So it can be It's as a proposal. Because as far as I understand this work on the phoneme anyway still takes some development time in the sense that uh no? Okay. I see. Mm-hmm. And Yeah.. Anyway the good news is that there are results. You are you have just to to decide uh, yeah, what what what uh what you want to work first and and and finalise. I think you can really start finalising mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah it's okay. So the tape is ta tape is at the end.
Yeah, sorry about that, Matthew is still on the way. Okay, hang on, reply coming. Yeah, it's okay. U oh, I hate these things. Voila. Okay. So Um we can maybe get a head start. Um have you been talking to Matthew about what you've been doing? Or Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, which was the intuitive feeling. Yeah. Yeah. And is and the r result was no. But uh bu but the question is if is that result no because it's no or is it also just because there's not really enough data to be sure about anything? Sure. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not gonna yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. This is so sort of a feeling that we had but hadn't shown. I think I mean i in uh from uh from an application point of view it might be interesting to make sure that your vocabulary contains all the words on the slides. But from a research perspective it's not interesting. There'd be very few. Well, this is h this is how the dictionary's calculated. It calculated such that if you don't have the word it doesn't affect to a great degree the the the word error rate. So Yeah. Sure. Yep. M like yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But th yeah. No. Well, this is yeah. That's yeah. Yeah. Oh sorry about that. Yeah. Of course. Yeah, yeah. Yep. 'Cause it's not gonna make any difference. Yep. Yep. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. I mean the it's probably very dependent on the speaker as well. Some people have a habit of just reading what they've got on their slides and some people are com are are well, or or or quite purposefully talk about different things so that they've sort of got multi-modality of you know. But so I mean I guess that's not a surprising result then. The um Yeah. Yeah. S Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. We s go straight to the semantics of the yep. Hmm. Yes. Maybe. Okay. Oh okay. Well I mean uh it just comes down to the to the mere fact that word error rate is just take the words. How many of them did you get right. Take plus or minus two or three or five or ten words doesn't really make any difference. So yeah. Even if those words at the end of the day would be quite important in any sort of search of the transcript. But at the end of the day why wouldn't you just use the slides to search the transcript? I if you have th slides, then yeah. No. Y you'd ju I mean the uh I mean it so I mean have you been doing other things then? Have you have you been thinking about what you would like to to do in in in place of this? Or or or leading on from this, given what you've learnt? 'Cause ours is strict. Yeah. Yeah. Associated? Yeah. Sure. The focus. Yeah, okay. Yep. Okay. M meeting action sort of focus. Yep. Hmm. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah. W Well Yeah. Ye yeah, okay. So I mean uh you could begin with s saying the a um the simple task of just determining whether or not the speech is related to the slide content, and which is sort of building upon what, you know, Dong and others have worked on in terms of, you know, is it discussion, monologue, from the original M_ four data collection. Uh a y are are you also considering that you could actually look at the relationship between meetings for instance? Um well okay, well I mean it if if if these similar sort of phrases or words were discussed in this meeting and were also discussed in the previous meeting, then you sort of have a a link between meetings for instance. I don't know I don't know how this you have to ches the check the statistics. But I I mean 'cause obviously you've gotta think towards what, you know, this this won't occupy ab ab you know, won't occupy you for three years or whatever just on this I guess. But have to look at all the future and so just a s Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. and yep. Yep. Yeah. Well y yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. I mean uh it's it's and because we don't have all the data collected or annotated yet, it's it's very difficult to know, isn't it. Yeah. Yep, yep, yep. Hmm. Yeah, sure. Or b or as you say, back-channel versus yeah. 'Cause I th think that's quite interesting. I mean 'cause it's an awful lot of speech activity, which is yeah. Sure. Okay. Okay. So I mean as far as that you've got everything to do that, I presume. Um you don't need any extra stuff from us in the immediate future? Or I mean that's good. That's good. But I mean it it Uh yeah I wouldn't get too distracted I guess on d d if you've got two tracks, I'd like to Yeah. Um Yeah. Hmm. But I And uh the k and the question is also are there other sort of more sensible ways of doing it. For instance um gaze tracking. I mean if if people are looking at the slides Yeah, sure. And it has specific to the environment and all that sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Uh but I mean for instance it should be linked to the other stuff that you've been doing on um call routing for instance. And and um, you know, uh error merit err error measures, yes. I mean I think I mean I I think that it's possible to draw some sort of relationship between the two, as we were saying. I mean maybe if you you don't measure things in terms of word error rate, maybe this sort of information does actually mean something. Given that fifty percent of the words are not actually interesting. Um so I mean W Well w uh w No, it doesn't solve the problem, but it's f what is it? Yeah. Hmm. Sure. Mm. Yeah. I think I think it's maybe an interesting test scenario and we know that you're sort of basing something around speech and and text. I think there needs to be one sort of extra higher goal above that so that you can motivate future research. Hmm Yeah. Yeah, this was Yeah. For English it's especially low. Yeah. Yeah. Speci Yeah. Yeah. Well another thing you have to remember is these models have been tuned to include AMI data. So I mean perhaps if you had slides and and presentations to do with something that was off topic, you didn't have you hadn't seen any prior data, then you might see a bigger contribution as well. But I mean essentially you've actually sort of included the information from the slides in the language model. Yeah. Okay. Okay, they're pre pre prepared. Okay. Yeah, yeah. It's not there. Okay. Y the audio quality though. Yeah. Yeah. Was good to yeah. Yeah. Ah. Yeah, they had like uh y uh y they, you know, they had this set-up with the uh the microphones. So someone every it there was one microphone shared between every two people. But they had deals with people forgetting to turn the microphone on, forgetting to turn it off, uh f it was it was meant I think they they chose that lecture theatre possibly with the idea that it would be good for collecting data. I mean I uh I'm sure they could have probably had University of Edinburgh host it or whatever. But I th I think the, you know, the H_C_I_ part of it didn't quite work out to how they planned. So ap Yeah. Um it is I mean it's same as us putting on a the headphones and whatever. I mean even that minor thing. I mean any any audio captured during that period is i is rubbish. But there's no sort of system that's really built to d to be able to say when you're you're capturing that. Okay. The Uh what will that incorporate? Will it incorporate like uh an S_M_A_ and uh Yep. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So no no uh microphone arrays or anything like that. I guess that's quite a that's a quite a bi big deal for setting up the recordings, I guess. Yeah. Yep. As you want, yep. Okay. Yeah, but let's pretend that it's not going to happen in any foreseeable future. Wh uh the I mean I'm just thinking from practical perspectives, you'd you'd have to the the AMI recognition system that we have now is either for these microphones or for the microphone array. There's no lapel system trained for instance. So I mean that in itself, it would I mean you'd have some fun training some more speech recognition models. But Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's Sure. Yeah. It's what you should be using for this type of task. I think Yeah. And every time we d we generate a new corpus and try to carry out new research we discover sort of areas that are too controlled, you know. I mean the AMI ones were a lot better in term of that than M_ four or whatever. But still. I mean es especially when you get into higher level sort of uh interpretation, it's yeah. Oh well. I'm uh I'm just curious, do the like the ICSI meetings, do they have anything other than the audio? Do they have slides or anything along that I don't think they would. Okay, I'm just thinking whether or not there an are any other sources, I mean maybe CHIL data? 'Cause it's I think it's gonna be more like the TAM type situation. So Mm-hmm.. I don't know. But I mean given that it's coming from the same basis as AMI, I I expect there has to be some sort of relatively f liberal sort of distribution policy. Yeah. Yeah. The one thing about that, and this is something that came up in the last NIST evals, was the fact that it's almost too uni-modal. You've just got one lecturer talking. So once again you don't see the the complex sort of levels of interaction. I mean uh y uh there's no way of getting around that. I mean you just have to think of a a task a challenge that is relevant to that type of recording, which might mm you might use the same methods as what we've been pr talking about today. But the actual sort of what you're trying to measure might need to be slightly slightly different I guess. I don't yeah, you know, in terms of in terms of, say, measuring whether or not they're talking about the slides or off channel, I mean you might find ninety eight percent of your data is directly referring to your slides in a t in a TAM. That is uh is in TAMs. Yeah, but I'm I'm meaning if you move on to these corpora, yeah. So you might wanna be doing something else basically, yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. And uh and at the s and at the same end of the day, you're probably going to be using or learning about the same techniques that you'll need for doing other things along these lines. So Okay. It well it's it's to make a proposal basically for your yep uh This n Okay. Yep. The sp Mm-hmm. Yeah. Sure. Sometimes it's a lot more. Yeah. Yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Well, you'd uh sure. At l at at least spot if they forget to talk about something and it won't let them continue on to the next slide until they've gone through all the points. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well uh that that was just through sheer weight of content though. W B yeah. As in five, six, you know number where where the graphemic yeah, well I yeah. Yeah. Although I remember discussing this like um 'cause uh when Neville was working on his his stuff, which was just based on the slides, if um he he asked me all you know, could I pre-segment the slides for him uh, you know, because you wanted to s you wanted to have the topic segmentation. And I said well just look at the the headings. Because anybody generally who writes the slides yeah. It's not okay. It's true for me then. Okay. Yep. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Uh it yeah, it depends, yeah. That's a stylistic thing as much as anything. Yep. Yeah. Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Which uh whether or not that's a good or a bad thing. It depends on the talk. Yeah, presentation, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Something we're taught at university from a very young age. the structure. Yeah, yeah, sure. It's all subjective. Hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. It's quite strictly imposed now. Ye Yeah. After the after the hard drive crash we took the time to actually rebuild the the the system and actually train 'cause originally we sort of had the idea of oh we'll use a recognizer that's been trained on a large amount of telephone speech data and that should give us a better result. I just as a contrast, I trained one specifically on this data. Results were almost identical um which says to me there's something wrong with the data rather than and it's nothing serious. It's simply that it hasn't been um chunked it or or segmented in a way that's typical of speech resources. in terms of um you can have like uh a two second utterance, uh credit cards, and then twenty seconds of silence coming after it, which in which when you f when you first think about it, you just think oh silence, whatever, nothing will happen. But a lot of the normalization that we use Uh yeah, C_M_S_ C_ C_V_N_. Uh so w we need a decent end point detection system running before we can we can we can do that. And we're converging on having one now just in in sort of tandem with this development of this web based recognizer. Um but of course unfortunately all these things take time. Um but I I think we should see a decent sort of improvement then. Not just in terms of no longer having recognition errors whenever silence appears. 'Cause you get that immediate benefit that you don't have any insertion errors. But also it should actually affect the recognition on the speech segments as well. Th The Yeah. Yeah. Mm that's the hard p oh I might uh given the trouble we've had with this corpus I can't make any promises. That's the intention, yep. Sure, sure. We trained the system just on this data. Like there were there were six thousand utterances that weren't used for uh the call routing side of things. I think they th there were thirteen thousand in the entire corpus. Six t half of them roughly we've thrown away. So use that for acoustic training. And the results from that were almost the same as what we got for the C_T_S_ model. Y yeah. But one can imagine a commercial system uh that that that s Steven Cox used from Nuance probably had all these things, built in end point detection, et cetera, et cetera. So Mm. Yeah. Yeah. And there's also just things like tele uh receiver noise at the beginning and or at the end of the and I mean these these are things you can get rid of if it's a Mm. Yep Mm okay, this is f okay. Okay. We can just run some generic yeah. Well I don't mind running it. I've got all the scripts set up. So Well I'm not I'm not sure I see the point actually. Uh Mm. I don't know. Yeah. Whatever, I don't know thing th I don't know whether that a I don't know whether that's a We might as well. 'Cause I mean we've up until now uh you haven't been running any recognition on and neither did Jean-Yves on that on that data. Yeah. Yeah. Oh sure, but I mean the scripts are so automated, it's just a matter of sitting uh uh submitting a job to the cluster and I don't I don't see the point of that. I don't mind running it. That'd it'd be like uh half an hour's work in a day to run the recognition scripts. I mean I I I I know you're saying. Artem should familiarise himself with the A_S_R_ systems or whatever. Fine. But I don't uh I d I don't think this is a point that's worth sort of worrying about at this stage anyway. I mean Well 'cause I'm I'm sort of assuming that that we're gonna have so an end point detection regardless of this working on this Nuance corpus. So We need it for AMI. We need it for um the online demo. For uh all these things, yeah. It's it's a lot more difficult than you would think. Well, it's speech and any and any other class of sound. That's the problem. It's And is And any other class, yeah. If it was just silence it'd be easy. But uh um and in controlled places you can't just assume it's it's, you know, any energy below a certain threshold. And this is what everybody sort of claimed the problem was solved with years ago. But Well, I mean this is once again a Yeah, sure. But I mean this is once again a very constrained task again. I mean it's it's it's you you're almost assured it's only gonna be a single speaker on the microphone. So I mean the the only sorts of noise you're gonna have to deal with uh is is is hiss or impulsive I would say. Or or that would be a good start. No, no. Yeah. yeah. It was showing that. Um you haven't heard from him I take it either? No. Okay. Well it'd be nice to get the thesis I think. There's a sort of just a research report sort of basis for this. Yeah. But Okay. yeah. apply some pressure. Uh n no it should be looking towards the start of next year basically. The is it so I mean you should Okay, which is Yeah. And it's nice to get some feedback on I mean that feedback will probably come after your proposal possibly. But um Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. N yeah, sort out any bugs or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. I I I'd prefer to go back to the C_T_S_ models I think as well 'cause I think I think they did work a little bit better. So yeah. Yep. Hayes is another one isn't it? Oh okay, sorry. I was like 'cause I saw you sli I saw you looking at your watch before, and I like wow. Gonna have to s Have this AMI corpus linked in no time. Oh okay. Uh not normally, yeah. It could go to thirty seven, thirty eight. Yeah. Yeah, we've been told. Okay. Fine.",IN1016
"Hey look, these are microphones they uh they're for women's shirts. Um okay, so um let's start. Um thanks for coming again to this meeting. I hope it won't be too long and especially that we'll make some progress on uh this uh on this small task that is putting people in our new rooms. Uh I hope you had fun in uh, well, designing something or uh asking the people about their preferences and uh things like this. So yeah, that's what I was talking about, it's for women's shirts. Um so um well, I think you remember all the constraints and the new settings, I think, you'll be more and more used to it as as soon as we move. So we have these one person, two person and three person rooms. Um and so that makes, I think, eighteen places. And we had about fifteen people and some uh spare uh spare mm well, working places to to put um may I first uh provide the answers to the the questions from the last time? Oh, great, yeah. So that will be part of the your uh your solution or suggestions to solution. But regarding the constraints um there is no immediate plan to to make separations between the rooms so that means basically well, we have to do with this setting and uh it's it's quite difficult to make new doors and new walls, so I think we shouldn't count on them in the next uh four years maybe. And they don't want us to sh I mean they don't want to provide an extra working space for Gisella with the other I_T_ admins, which we could understand, because it's sort of full over there, but uh at least that's what they said. So it seems we uh yeah the well, we cannot change the habits of the whole school just for us. Though it wouldn't be a bad thing maybe, but uh we'll see. So regarding the possibility to put four people in one of the two uh three person rooms, um well, it's not very easy, we'll have to play uh quite uh quite wisely with the furnishing. It it looks like it's not impossible, at least on the one that is a bit uh longer, on on the right. So uh the one uh here. It should be possible to put four persons. If we could avoid it, it would much simplify things, but uh, well, we'll see. No. No no no. Yeah, I think, yeah. It it's more a matter of how to arrange the furniture, but uh since we are experts at this task uh okay, so maybe we could count on on four places, but the final decision is not really ours, so uh we'll see actually this Exactly. Or one of the intern positions, the people who might come or something like that. Um okay so these were the um the answers. So actually I I did my uh my proposal as a slide. Would you like me to start or would you like me to end? It's uh Oh, great. Beautiful. Okay, then let me um explain very briefly the the rationale for for this. So it's the same uh schema that you know. In red you have the uh uh oh, excuse me, that's quite uh annoying, excuse me. Um hello. Oh, yeah, um, can I can I call you a bit later in about half an hour. I'm just in the middle of a meeting and I'm talking. Oh okay, thank you. Bye-bye. Um, sorry for this. Fortunately we were just uh the four of us. Um. Okay, so, let me get back to into the proposal after the brief interruption. Um so the names are in red. Now um well, one of the reasons at least for me for doing this was to more or less group people uh with within projects, because I I think that sometimes they ju they just discuss together and uh it's easier if they are in the same office. And um which is quite happy actually, I I also thought that some professors might enjoy, or at least uh don't don't say anything about, being with their assistants. So I was happy to hear Susan uh saying that Maggie and Bruno could well together, and Pierrette and uh Marianne in in the same office. Um so what I can say is uh that I also understood that Susan would be rather in favour of uh, well, having her own office, so uh it's it's it's working like this. I put the lounge in the middle. It's also one of the rooms with the fewer uh the fewest uh windows. So I think that's not a problem, because you're not going to just stay there and stare outside. Uh but it's it's nicer to have a nicer view from your office, I guess. I don't know. Yeah, maybe, I thought in an angle, but that's obviously not very Yeah. Okay and so next to the photocopy maybe it wouldn't be a bad place. Here? Okay. Yeah, we'll have to check tha yeah, but the printer is quite small if we fi find just a small table for it. maybe one day we'll have a photocopy that is also a printer. So okay, but uh I wouldn't well insist on this I think okay, so the printer, well, we'll remove it if we work from this uh this solution. So uh I_M_two is more or less in the upper left side. Um I said more or less um uh upper uh lower left side uh you have SwissTra and, so the two projects from the list. And then on the on the right side. Maybe not a ver a very good solution for Gisella. If you can suggest something uh better, because she's with two people who uh well, two P_H_D_ students, and it's true that she has, yeah, a lot of phone calls to make, but um it's some way to to solve some constraints. I think this is a very open thing. Uh if you want we can use this document or we could just, say, first listen to your suggestions and see if we erase everything or just do some modifications using this one. Um yeah, maybe not a very strong one. Then they maybe you are you have better suggestions. Um it was I think sort of one of the uh places they re that remain and I I think, yeah, there is no strong constraint and uh well, she's a smoker, but the policy is that we don't smoke, so it's even better if she's uh with a second person. Uh-huh. Okay. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Yeah mm. Yeah, that was the case and uh she was a bit uh reluctant, but Mm-hmm. Yeah, we could store files there and things like that. Mm-hmm. Okay, so if you want I can already do this change here. Sorry you're Um. Mm-hmm. Yeah, th yeah th when the printer is, yeah, it's it's the main one. We have a secondary one which we could try to accommodate in another room, but it's basically, yeah, the peop the the printer where everybody prints. Um so I change this. So maybe I would suggest let me le k can I hear also let us hear from you. And then if we can work out a solu a common solution from this one, then we go back to to this slide. And if not, um we'll just, well start from scratch. Um. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll try. I'll bring my walkman and uh Yeah. Uh David, you had also uh what's Ah. Uh-huh. Oh let me put the plan, sorry. I will display uh yeah, this is the empty one. I don't want to influence you. So so you would put uh Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. you can you can even stand and just show us there. Okay, so we would prefer the names. Okay I I don't want to influence you too much, but uh mm I'm perfectly happy to start with this as the basis and then change things. Yeah, maybe in different, just Uh-huh. Oh Mm-hmm. Or actually, Pierrette is a woman too. Yeah, it's the feminine of Pierre. Uh-huh. bad. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and for me it's also uh I would prefer maybe not to be in a three person office, just to be a bit calmer, and, Martin, so I'm very happy with you since I proposed it. But I could also be happy with most of the other people, so even in a three person room. It's it's fine. Okay, so let's keep in mind, maybe, this uh constraint of balancing the the genders uh we'll see if we can uh do something for it. Uh I've asked some of them, and I've also used a little bit uh what I've well, I mean the the present arrangement, just not to to shock people too much. And it's also people that I know um get on well quite quite well together, and also work on the same project, like for instance, Marianne, uh uh the Finnish Marianne, and uh Nikos who interact quite a lot on uh on. Um, yeah, Maria and Yalina seem uh to go on one quite quite well. Uh Nancy had no strong preference, specially since she's no longer allowed to smoke in in her office. Um yeah, so I think, well, at least as far as I I asked there was no major objection. Um. Yeah, that's true. That's true. I um so we could put Nancy with David and uh put Agnes yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's a small advantage and uh I it's a bit more uh more comfortable, actually. Um. Mm-hmm. Yeah, maybe. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Very good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, probably Mm-hmm. Yeah. So Agnes has worked Mm-hmm. They they have worked together on, so this makes some sense. Um at yeah, I mean Yeah, as far as I know I think it's probably quite a good uh uh good match. First one should be Maria, but it's still uh one and a half. Okay, let's switch uh Mm-hmm, yeah. Mm-hmm. I'll just uh Yeah. Mm yeah, I I don't think Yeah, so s s okay so since we are supposed to do a final proposal. Sorry, uh let me move the printer um next to the photocopier. Okay. And we'll find some way to um, well, attach it to a wall or something like this. Yeah, I think so, yeah. Um okay, so that's the uh mm-hmm. Uh I don't think we can put visitors in the lounge, it's uh Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's Mm-hmm. How how would it be to put the lounge in one of the smaller offices? Like in, well, in in one of the one person offices? W I I know they are actually quite uh quite demanded, so um I th I think, Susan, you are very happy with this solution, so okay. In Gisell Yeah, it's probably too small. Okay, yeah, doesn't work. Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay, let's be innovative. Um. Mm-hmm. But the problem is it it has been decided by everyone and approved by the school that we we need the lounge, so I I think it's simply not No actually, uh I I'm sorry, it's uh yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh. Okay so so how do we split the room? This one. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. So Yeah. But what about if people want to have a small discussion in the lounge? Well, not the newspapers, because no scientific articles. Journals. Uh-huh. Yeah. So you would like to put it, yeah, within yeah, and then who who yeah. Yeah. Yeah okay, but then that means that we'll put the lounge on the right side, uh here. And uh here we'll put two places for visitors. Three. But that means the office will be at least for the moment empty. That looks very bad. Okay, so that could take the the free place over there. Uh I mean Yeah, I think okay, so we need what, two, three positions and one new person arriving, X_ or something like that. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And and where is the lounge? No okay, no way. I'll I'll have my head cut off if we don't have a lounge. So uh No no no no, let's do the lounge corner. Okay. At least. I mean otherwise I cannot really defend it, because it it was agreed and we cannot just come back on every every decision we made. Yeah, I think so, yeah. Okay. Well, let's have the visitors first. Okay, so what we need is a new and two. So I think we can put, what, Maria or Yalina? I don't want to separate them really, but uh Oh. Mysel, I don't like that office actually. Um so I was thinking to put here Yeah, now. so it's either Y we could put the visitor with you, Martin, but it's probably okay, let's try le let's try this. Uh let's try Maria here. Oh, you don't mind? Perfect. No no, we'll put a visitor place in there. If you don't mind. Uh I think it's Paola. Yeah. Um. Yeah, could be. If Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, I I would prefer you, I think. Okay, let me keep you. Okay, we'll put Paola and a visitor here. So Paola is the new person. And a visitor, uh vis. Is that vis one? And then we'll we'll still have probably some way to put a second visitor here. Vis two. Oops. Sorry, it's not very nice, but Does this display better? I think it's not bad. Yeah, don't put her alone. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. No, but we said that we won't discuss or maybe if we organise some kind of, you know, coffee at the end of the day, or a drink, then the two people will stop working. I don't know, maybe they won't be happy. Okay then, Martin let let me put you in that office and I'll put Paola with me. No? So Martin goes where? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's true. Okay, so let's put Maria in the separate office. And we have Paola. Oh sorry, what were you thinking? So who is with Maria here? Okay. Yeah. And no visitor? Yeah, but that means that this room, the middle one, would be quite empty. All the I mean, two visitors and the fifty per cent pers person, I don't think it's very uh reasonable. Yeah, but let's split them a little bit, so that when there are no visitors, at least people are Yeah, I think so. So this goes here goes visitor two. Paola is there. Here goes visitor one. And is this better? Except that we cannot read it, but apart from this Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Let me call this visitor one, which implies that uh it will be the first one occupied by a visitor when they come. And this visitor two which means it's like a, well, you know, second uh second chance. Or we could. What would this change? Mm-hmm. Oh yeah, very good. Yeah, so maybe in the long run we'll get a wall. Uh-huh. Al although there are three windows, but um okay. So where would we move David to Maria Da with Maria. Do you have any preferences, David? Um. Well, he already is mixed. So, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't put the two visitors in the same room, because when there is no one it makes a big hole, and when there are two people, so it makes too many variations, but Yeah. Mm-hmm. You prefer that too, Susan? Okay. Okay. Oops. Sorry. Uh what did we say here? This one. Yeah, my uh Okay. Well, I think that was really decided and it's it's no we no, because, actually if we do a proposal without a lounge, and, you know, the other group will Yeah, exactly, and that means that all the constraints that we said and uh all the other things just, we we well, just basically disappear. Uh-huh, which means we've worked for nothing. Okay. Uh what's what's wrong with this? Okay. Uh, I don't. Oh, you have to go, Susan? Okay. Yeah, well, we are almost done, Susan, but uh we we'll we'll just check the the items. Yeah, please. Okay. No problem. Yeah, we we'll just review the items to see is we look at all the constraints and then you'll be able to say the final uh yes or no. Um. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think that's okay. Yeah, we checked. Uh. I don't think so. No. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's a bit yeah, that was the point in letting David there and but okay, maybe we'll just leave it as an option. David or visitor one or two. It's uh Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. So we'll know that uh that the region actually around here is probably movable. Yeah, either, yeah, we can switch Maria or Paola or David. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, no, exactly. Yeah, tha tha yeah, that's why I always try to put the to separate the visitors, just to balance a little bit. But okay, we'll uh, we'll be open on on that point. Yeah, it will become Mm-hmm. Or it depends also on well, if Yalina stays longer or not, which is not yet very clear, but um Okay, w we'll see. Anyway, we'll we'll be open. Mm I don't really know, I think her master thesis is probably due um no, I would say, yeah, maybe June next year? At the latest. Yeah. Actually I don't know, unfortunately. Well, we we won't have any extra meeting, well, the four of us, so, yeah, this one has to to be the the final one. Um so um we'll we'll have actually I I'll present this to, well, with the other, I'll compare it with the other one, and uh try to make a decision actually. I think it's even uh a bit later, or in two days, or something like this. Again, okay. We yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. W we can leave it like this and then Uh, yeah, there will be names on the doors. So she'll be a visitor. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, we'll we'll keep it like this. Um okay I, well, I'll try to to express all these constraints and uh and say in particular that the two rooms over here actually are sort of uh, well, s things could be changed over there, but on some other sides Yeah, the visitor space, yeah, I'll uh Mm-hmm. Yeah, uh that's true. And Well, I think this I I'm not very sure, but I think this will be done after the meeting, when okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. A as far as know I think Agnes is also taking care of a proposal so okay, yeah, I'll circulate this. Perfect. Yeah, exactly. Okay, so maybe we'll learn some more constraints. Um okay. Um yeah, actually as I as I told uh Martin um, well, this is the last time we meet, so uh this is, well, more or less our proposal, and uh we'll have a meeting, I think, it's uh it's in two days or something like that. Uh to discuss and compare with the other proposal and uh, well, make a final decision. Actually, probably a pre-final one, since we'll have to check again with everyone. But uh Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well, so actually I think, I I'm not very sure, but the most important thing is, well, finding out when we will move and this happens in probably, I think, next month or depends also on how, well, the uh the furnishing and uh well goes on.. No. Um. Oh no no no. No the roo the the building is very no actually I've seen it. Uh the building is very modern and uh you can have actually we'll get them activated, yeah. A and I think you get at least th yeah, three per room. So uh or probably more than that. Okay. Okay. Yeah, sometimes he needs two two computers. Yeah, no this this. Hmm. Oh no, unfortunately that's decided by the uh the school, so the the chairs are blue, the the desk is uh is brow, well, light-brown. And uh Uh, normally it's done automatically, except that we'll have to think Yeah, uh well, these are dictated by the names. Uh it's probably more difficult for the lounge. What we'll have is have a bit less furniture in the lounge and then bring all the, well the old it's not old, because we just bought it, but uh all the furniture from the previous lounge we'll we'll bring it here. Uh. Well, it's the faculty that will take care of uh Yeah, yeah, I think yeah, i I mean it's a completely different issue from uh, you know, arranging people. It's just uh how the moving will take place. And there are things to to take care of, but uh it's uh quite unrelated with these things. Yeah, we'll get uh we'll get all the information. Uh thinking about internet connections, I think it's quite okay for the the for the the printer to be there. Yeah, I think it's i it's feasible. We'll we'll check. So the the violet box here is uh uh our mailboxes also. Um not at the sixth floor. Yeah, yeah no not not in the building for the moment. I mean not at this Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, I think it's a bit off topic already. So um let's say that i it's a proposal. We'll try it I'm, well I'll try to to express the the constraints and uh your opinions and uh well, I think, finally everyone can veto something if there is a huge problem, but I think with this we we don't run into huge problems. Yeah, obviously. So let me save this. And thank you for spending all this time. Hope you're all happy.
No no it's the opposite. And I also checked with uh Maggie and Pierrette. Great. Come now, it's not full over there. No uh no. And and I and I went over and I looked at that room, too. There's plenty of space for four people. Yeah. Ah. Exactly. Yeah. Mm. Well just t just to uh uh complete uh, I talked both with Maggie and Pierrette and both of them are happy to share offices. They have no problem whatsoever. Uh they're they're easy, but uh could be uh as Pierrette has right now, that she cou she is happy to continue to share with uh Marianne, uh and and Maggie, for example, to share with uh it could be with Bruno, because they work on the SwissTra together and they like to gossip together, so. People who don't turn off their phone in a meeting. It's fantastic. Yeah. Yes. No yeah. Yeah, why not put the printer out in the hallway? It is there enough space there for a photocopy and printer. The photocopy is a bit big. Well, I've a question. What's the justification for giving Nancy her own office? Mm doesn't help, yeah. Well, Gisella will not be very happy about that uh. We tried that and Gisella really didn't like to have a printer and people in and out all the time and uh Uh remember Andrei, that was uh yeah yeah. Lot's of phone calls. Yeah. Earplugs uh whatever. So, yeah, you have to show us which one you were talking about David, we didn't Ah the centre room. Uh he wants to mix sexes. Andrei did you ask these people if this was okay with them? Yes. Yeah, but Agnes is also working with David, so Yeah, but there's Yeah, but that doesn't mat that's not important. There w one question I was wondering about though, 'cause three is always uh well the more people in a office uh the less ideal, that wouldn't it maybe be better to put David in, since he's only half-time. So that way, then there's not three people all the time. Yeah. Uh no. Uh Maria is Maria is the closest, but she's still not uh uh yeah. No, because don't forget we already have somebody coming in uh January. At least one person. Yeah. Or we make four space in the three people rooom. Yeah. Yes, yes. That's an excellent idea. It's too small for a uh yeah. We put it the the furniture that we got for our reading room, we put it into the other half of the three person room. Would that fit? A little divider of some kind. Well not just newspapers. But also to read articles. Mm-hmm. It's not a visitor. It's a a new p p full-time person arriving in January. No, that's where we're gonna put the lounge. Well for No no no no, we we have to Yeah yeah yeah. No, there's no space. The lounge is in the free space. After all that we went through to get the budget for it, we really have to uh No, wait a minute, yeah. No, we are not gonna keep Marianne in a three uh person place uh, just having Marianne in the lounge. Yeah. But wait a minute, then Andrei has a two person office all for himself. Yeah. Wha what's what's her name again, Andrei? Paola. Okay. Martin goes back to Andrei. Um Paola well, Paola being new, I I think it would be better to put her with somebody else. No no put why not Maria or Yalina? Martin stays. Maria's. Well, we have Uh yeah. No, the rooms have to look like they're sort of occupied uh. Oterwise, we might uh lose room or two. This is always the game. No, but but look, Martin, it's quite a long room, it has two doors Yeah, the occupancy is better that way. Because there is regular there is regular occupancy, yeah. We won't be very credible. I'll be right back. I I just need to see somebody. Sorry, yeah. No, because there is another person right now, a student that I just uh um hired. And she's just working right now for uh for November and December, yeah. A she uh she's a she's a real visitor. She's a real visitor that I just made a contract for her for two months. Yeah. What's the timeline on this now? So you have a meeting when? Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. How many connections are there per room? No, get the uh for the the bigger rooms you get double for every workplace you get two lines. Yeah. Yeah. No, because lots of people have, you know, they have a Sun and they have a a PC, so Well, we have to say how many places that we want to have. Yeah, they'll just give us a date when The well, there is downstairs in the building and pretty soon the whole building will be covered. Yeah. Yeah, but right now in uh downstairs it's fine. Some people can pick it up on sixth floor. But pretty soon the whole building will be covered. Yeah, okay.. Yeah.
That would be fine if one of the person is fifty per cent. So me, for example. Please. Because the professors uh, you have personal printer or there is only one printer? Because if not the person the printer can go in a room of three people. That's typical of case where there's the lab and there's the printer is there. Yeah, okay, for me uh, as uh I don't know l uh the people a lot, uh you suggested that uh there's a la a lack of men s so, I would re certainly put uh not two men in the same office. I would try to share them with the women so uh for example in your slide I could uh switch either you or Martin with uh uh the other room. This one. So. Yes please. Yeah yeah, I was wanting to change this wa Mm-hmm. Yeah, but I need your uh your slide, because I was talking about your slide. Yes, so here you can see that the the the men is I mean, they are always sh sharing the room with a g with a woman. I mean, there's Bruno, me, uh Pierrette and Nikos is a guy also. Oh. Sorry for this. Mm-hmm. So I mean, this is perfectly fine, I will just send Martin and Andrei for Maria or or Yalina or Nancy, maybe. So Yeah, here there are two men. So I mea yeah. I it's nice. I don't think I mean there's a lack of men here, in in in this in this lab. So I would change one, switch one.. but we agree that it's not important to to share the room with someone that has the same project. quite happy to have the the full room some fifty per cent of the time. Is there anyone that is going to finish P_H_D_ or or leave or. No, but a lounge in a one person room is really too small. No no, I don't think we can choose. No. Let's put m Maria or Yalina in the in the in this place. No lounge. Well, the the lounge can not be in here t with two people. I mean, you cannot go there and discuss and and two people working there in the room. Sure not me. That's true. Uh it's completely fine. Then uh the two visitors will be in one room, but doesn't that's fine, because maybe there are not two visitors at the same time. Uh we'll see. one. Yeah yeah, you need, because sometimes you need a laptop and So you agree with a lounge?
The the question is is it is it against the regulation security regulation of the school. That's that's the important point. Okay.. Mm-hmm. Okay, okay. Yes. That looks good. People sh yeah that's. Let me check that I I di I didn't. S Yeah, but putting the printer in the lounge is just killing the lounge. It's not a question where it is, it's a question of you are printing all the time so uh Yeah, that's that's a possible. Yeah. Why not? uh I would have I would have a provocative suggestion to put Gisella to switch Nancy and Gisella. Put Gisella, the fax, and the printing machine the printer in the one person room as a as a Okay, so the printer that's that's not the s not the hard constraint but uh 'Cause I really do think it's important to have an admin room clearly identified as an admin room and only an admin room, where you have files, where yeah, you can close it, you have the personal files of the of the people of the of the of the unit etcetera, etcetera. So for instance I be fully against the fact that my personal files are in f in a in a room that is not specifically dedicated for that. printer can be in the in the in the corridor. That's uh that's uh that's perfectly alright. I'm perfectly alright to share the room with you has a view on the old town. That's um You have to be aware of what I was saying last time was that you have to suffer some suffer from fro from phone calls. So if you have a walkman that's that's good. Yeah, because there are plenty of things that are that are okay so uh Yeah but for Pierrette an and Maggie it's uh it's. It's a wish or it's uh it's because they I didn't get your solution. What was it again? So? Ah, okay. But that's not so much a question of uh men or women, it's more the question of, as I said, that's uh Um here you have only P_ you have P_H_D_ students that are a group. There you have s senior researchers that are a group, which is to me more Unless it corresponds to some specific demand like it is in the case in Maggie Maggie's case and Pierrette's case. I think that's a very efficient way of doing things, because Yeah, mm I'm perfectly happy with with Andrei so. Sure but um But isn't there just a a a question of proximity you put David with Agnes? Um but isn't Agnes working um in a in a more substantial way in uh with people like uh either Maria or Yalina? 'Cause Yeah, yeah, I I know. No, that's true that's true. the other constraints are are satisfied somehow so. No but what I mean it was was the three the two three person rooms, I think that they can mix them the way they want. I mean if they prefer to be uh Maria tha uh Yalina and Nikos, and Nancy and Marianne on the other side well, no that's not completely equivalent, because Nancy all are P_H_D_ students or masters students, but Nancy. Correct? Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I would switch David and Nancy typically. Which doesn't mean that David should be in this room. He could be in the other one. For me uh the two three people rooms are really they have to be uh re-shuffled according to people personal preferences. But I definitely would put uh Nancy with Agnes in the two person room. Yeah. But again, it's also a question of personal preference. I mean you you can't be in a room with person you don't want to be with. I see if you do it this way, you mean that in the two three people room there will be one that is not so overloaded, because of David, because David will be part time and the other one not so overloaded, because there is uh one free position uh, knowing that this one free position uh will not stay free very long. Yes so And this is still a worry for me, because we are still we don't still still don't have enough space for the visitors. Unless we put them in the lounge. Therefore I w Yeah. Yeah. We need to have at least three visitors' position, because positions, because Outside. Yeah. So that we keep it, you mean. It depends it depends on how we think about the lounge. If it's thought as being a reading room. No. If it's thought as the que that that's really a very important question to me. Do we do we put priority on the fact of being able to read newspapers in our in our offices or in our uh work place? We can read newspapers elsewhere. And I really do think it's more important for lab to be able to decently uh welcome visitors that come to the lab than to have a place for reading newspapers. Newspapers you can read them home. know we can go to the cafeteria or you can sit somewhere else. You can go on the balcony if it's if it's in the summer. So I I don't understand why we why we should put priority on lounges if we if we don't have enough space for accommodating visitors. That's just not not according to my priorities. S so let's let's put the lounge in Susan's office, and Susan's in Susan in the lounge with three visitors mm? I would advocate to just remove the lounge. We it's a luxury for us. We don't have space for a lounge. It's let's be you you cannot you cannot go at the at the at the at the in front of your colleagues and saying, I p if I have to choose between uh reading my newspaper and disc and having a a decently welcomed uh v uh research visitor, I prefer to read my newspaper. That's just not that's just not realistic. I mean, we are researchers. But then? Then you have the three people room, that positions, split it in two parts as as Susan was was uh proposing last time was a ha was a wall and you have a lounge there can read your newspapers and we have a full two room two person room where we can certainly accommodate three visitors. And at least we have some uh free margin for the next two years, or the next year. The the three people over there. Yeah. And put uh uh mm They are not supposed to have a discussion in the lounge, they are supposed to read their newspapers. And to drink their coffee. Uh scientific articles. No that's not that wasn't the goal. The the goal of the lounge was was a place where you can relax. you can do it in your office. it's it's it's you have a good chairs to read newspapers that you don't want to break you heart your your your your back your office. Yes. Yes. Three. No, we have our visitor that is arriving. Uh what did you say, Susan? uh okay. No no. That could take one one positions in the in the lo in the Ah okay, that that's an idea. if if if if you forget about the lounge. What you could do is to move either Mari Maria or Yalina in the in the mm what is currently the lounge. That means that we have one person there with one free position. We have one free position in the in the room that Maria or Yalina is coming from and one free position over there. So we have three position distributed over the rooms where we can accommodate No lounge. Louge. You take the furniture of the lounge and you put it in the corridor. you you will explain to your visitors that unfortunately they have a position in the toilet, because there is a reading room where people have to relax. It could be Nikos, for instance. Could put you can switch. But it's a lounge. Yeah but then Yeah you could you could put me there. I mean, Andrei. Because I will be there half time, and the visitors probably will not so much complain about phone calls. Well there is this full-time person arriving in I I think it's really important to to plan with that. would it be possible to have Paola in your office? 'Cause that's that's something that we we should be deciding. Either you want to keep me in your office, which is alright, and then we have to forsee a place for Paola somewhere. I I think that's that's not realistic to have a planning Why didn Yeah. That's visitor one. Mm. somebody else. Not supposed to discuss, you are supposed to relax. Because you don't want to separate Ma Maria and Yalina? Why? 'Cause Yalina, i it's not even sure she stays. It's a master student so uh Yeah. And we have, yeah, and we have two visitors and a masters student and a p and a part-time person. I was thinking the other way around. To keep Paola with Maria in the two people room and to have this one with two, Yalina and David in the three people room. Paola. No, that's a two people room, so Yep. No, Yalina is there, David is there but you need to have to put visitors somewhere, I mean uh Ah. Oh. Okay. Well It's a little bit crowded in. 'Cause you have well, not yet, of course, because Paola is not has not arrived, but uh starting from January, you will have two full-time person plus one part-time person plus one visitor that's 'Kay. Okay. But why couldn't we basically Move you, David, in this two people room with Maria? Maria plus one half pa uh half-time person? And you have Paola, Yalina, one visitor position, and I still keep hope that uh Marianne, Nikos that the lounge will on the, on on the on the long term disappear, because anyhow I don't believe there can be a lounge where in a place where there are already two people working. So the lounge will just die after some point and it uh it Still, I mean,. Ah okay, ah it has two doors. Yeah, that's true. Ah yeah, but then then yeah, okay okay. Okay, that's true. 'Kay then then there will be a wall. Okay. Yeah, that's good. Uh she she wa she wants mixing peo uh men and women, so or she he. Yeah, right. Yeah, that's to me it's more realistic. Yeah, but then then you can you can move for instance if you move David to uh with Maria. Then I think it's it's better. First it's better. I think it's uh, because it's more it's stabler. 'Cause visitors stay and go. Yeah, that's good. To me that's the best we can do. If you if we realistically can plan to have a lounge. Okay okay okay. I go I got the message. Yes, sir. So who has strong strong opposition to that? But do you have any no. But it's just a decision. No, you just have. Okay. I think we we we accommodated most of the constraints. 'Cause uh we are sure that Maggie and Bruno uh Maggie is happy with having Bruno in her office and Pierrette is happy to have uh Marianne in her office. That's that that checked? Okay. And, yes, and no reason to think that there should be uh uh uh uh an impossible situation? Same thing for Marianne and Marianne F_ and Nikos? Uh Paola we don't know yet, because she didn't arrived yet. And uh, well, Yalina Aha, that means for a for a short time Yalina will be just alone in the three person room. That's a bit a problem. Ah but then then we what we could just for the sake of having a defendable solution, uh as long as Paola is not has not arrived, is to switch for the proposal Paola and David But we we really plan that as soon as Paola is here or even earlier David will go to the to the two people room. It's just it will be switched. 'Cause this this this this is dangerous to propose. I mean you have a three per three person room with one masters student in it. Okay? So I wouldn't I wouldn't propose that. Okay. But as soon as Paola is here, uh it starts to be better. And we will have visitors, for sure. Yeah, right right, that's true. Yeah. Oh yeah, that's a point, true. Ah do we have a do do we know do we know when when is she supposed to finish the her uh master thesis? In June? June next year. Okay, wha when when do we when do you when whe uh when are we supposed to sub sumbit the proposal? 'Kay, that's now. Okay. Mm. Okay. Well so as soon as we have Susan we can uh we can um so I would I would switch again. Da but that, as I say, it's just for the sake of the of the proposition, so I even I'm even ready to uh to internally say that David will actually be in this room. What does it what does it change? names on the doors? Aha, so if we 'cause, Susan, the the the the problem the let's say the techn not the technical, the psy psychological problem we have is pra I'm extremenly happy with that solution. It would be a workab work working solution starting from January, when Paola will be here. But currently if we present it as it is, we have a three person room that is only occupied by a masters student. Aha, so sh you have a student. That we that's a rea real visitor to some extent. Ah, so this one and this two one are just ah okay, okay. So then we would have two people there. Okay. Yeah then that works. Yeah, but you you really have also to say that that that a a unit has to has to have some some horizon. I mean uh it's it's it's it's extremely important in the research domain that we can have people coming to visit us. Uh the second point I would suggest is that before you go to defend it, you should uh mm circulate it uh over mail to all the all the con involved people. To double-check so that I would do it before. 'Cause you if you if you spend time defending a thing then um I don't know, Agnes comes to you or Pierrette comes to you saying it, no I don't want to be with Marianne. Uh what do you do? So so it doesn't cost anything, it's just people will look at it, say oh, great, I have a view on the mountain and I'm uh with a person I like, so I'm happy. Because Yeah, it's it's it's not it's not completely it's an important issue, because uh I need to know, when I will have the office decided, the phone number decided. Because these are information that I have to provide to administration. I'm reachable when I'm at uh well, they can phone me on the mobile, but uh I would definitely prefer to have a clean filled administrative form that I can give back. Yes, yes. Okay. And then uh of course you have these all these practical issues, how about internet connections? Well uh, network connections, I mean? Yeah, because that's also something double check. You know, if you are in a room with three people and one network connection Well no no um. Okay. But are they activated? Okay. Okay. Ah okay. Good that looks good. And if you go back to the uh to the uh other sli slide where you have the furniture so with this uh we do we have any m any any word to say and uh so that I would like to have a red chair or a blue desk uh or a So that's the standard things. But do we have to order something or is it done automatically, so it will be in the office when we move in? Mm-hmm. Mm. And how about the boxes, because at you have to say when you will be moving the boxes, so that you have uh people for moving them. Or here you're supposed to move them yourself, or So we'll receive some information about that? Okay. That's true, but uh right, right, right.. Okay, okay. Yeah, that's an important point, the the printer needs to be connected. By the way uh uh is there any uh wireless connection uh antennas for getting 'cause I I've I've heard that there is one downstairs in the that But that's important. I mean, typically for the laptops it's Ah okay, good. Yeah yeah,. Mm? Sure. At least the four of us will not veto. at least. Okay..",IB4004
"No, it's kind of we should maybe find a method to do stuff. Like, I don't know, choose one parameter. The first parameter to choose people to choose where to put people, like I dunno maybe permanent staff and non-permanent staff, we know that professor will stay for a long time. We uh we don't know for the other So maybe that could be the first parameter to take into account. Not just to have this dis Yeah, and have this discussion every two years. Because it's, you know make sense for everyone. So we can choose where to put uh, I would say, the the the three first one of the list. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And yeah. Mm and maybe the two other senior Andrei and Nancy. And then, yeah. Mm.. Yeah, that could be an idea. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. can switch. Yeah. Which is So we need to put Pirette, Andrei and Nancy do we want to the the question is now is do we want to put the three together or the three completely separate with other people? Yeah, yeah. Some, some. Yeah, but few, less than Pierrette. So we have a Mm. Yeah. Um I just realised something. The two people room in the middle which has only one windows, it's gonna be pretty hard to put two people inside that room. Yeah. Yeah. Except we yeah. And near the photocopier. Yeah. And what about the reading room? Yeah, but you I mean uh I think, everybody is supposed to spend more time in their office than in the reading room. So we might think that it's better to have a more comfortable office than a more comfortable reading room, I don't know, it change the plan of the morning, I'm sorry, but I just realised that stupid architect put only one windows. Who built this building? Do we know that? I dunno. What do you think? Yeah. Yeah, I know, but in the last meeting nobody just took attention at this one windows problem. And I think it is one problem. Yeah, you too, I can I can say the thing to you, I'm sorry. The two people? That's really welcoming and warming. Yeah. What what what? Say it again. No no, but the main problem we have the same number of place and the same number of people now. Yeah. And uh I just noticed that we have this two people room with only one windows. Yeah. You don't mind to have okay, so, Nikos and you have to find yeah. You have to find somebody agree to come with you. And it's not a question of you it's a question of windows. Who would you put with you? Let's put a fifty per cent so From the David. Yeah. Do you know David? You will learn to know him. So David and Nikos, it's done. And with um Pirette uh Andrei and Nancy. How many P_H_D_ student does she have? And me.. Yes, I'm doing a P_H_D_. Yes. Officially. Um. So and can you put the the map again, so we s see what happen. Um. That's that might be a good idea to put Pirette with two P_H_D_ student, whoever they are. Which one? Okay. So Pirette and the two Mariannes. Okay, so wha put me with Marianne and Pirette, it's alright. And we put Marianne in front if she want to be No, on the room on the opposite oh no, that's the old town view. Pick a room. Is that alright? Is the old town view beautiful enough? Mm. Yeah. Okay, so Marianne, and who do you want to work with? Nancy, Martin, Pirette? No, Pirette is done. Andrei, Yalina, Maria and Agnes. Okay. Okay, so put Yalina with um Yeah. Okay. And we have uh now Do you think it's a good idea to put Martin and Andrei together, since they are working on the same project? Yeah. And we might put Martin and Andrei and someone else in the three person room, since the fifty per cent, it's a good Okay. Maria and Nancy. That's really strange. So, what do we think about that? Mm-hmm mm yeah. I think this project thing is not good thing. This project splitting I mean. Splitting by project. Yeah. No but if you if if you split by project you put me in one person room. That's hard. Could you say that again? Okay. Okay. So you just you just move him or the two groups? You just Yeah. No. Except coffee time and that's important project too, but uh gossiping and stuff like that, yes. Mm. Yeah. And it's quite funny to to to hear other activities around you. And not always the same stuff. Especially when it's activity that you don't understand or yeah. Yeah. No, that's quite nice. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay, why not... I'm not totally convinced. I'm not convinced about this. I dunno. Yeah. First of all, no from the beginning I said the three person room it's quite I mean it's a disadvantage. And um to change a little bit this disadvantage we put somebody fifty per cent, in three person room, so we could do the same in the three person rooms, but there is still this problem yeah. Yeah. yeah, it's here for working. Not not us but exactly. And you, so there is no view. And Pirette as well. We uh all have uh reception hours. Yeah. Yeah.. You can move with your desktop, yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay, can we say that David uh is yeah. Instead of Okay, but okay. No, because I was thinking of we can um having these two office which are near to the lift Keep this office for reception people. If I can con we are Pirette, the two Marianne and I, are receivi and Maggie and Susan are receiving a lot of student. So we With the Finnish for example, if you want me. Yeah, so that's ki yeah, yeah, okay. Lopeta. Yeah, yeah. Uh that's nice to have a corner a student, I mean, a student area. You know what I mean. Yeah, to find us and it's also quite noisy when you have this kind of parade of student before the exams. So if you work with me and you have this agree with that? So and the photocopier is still Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, but it's too far from Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's quite good. And then yeah. So we have a three windows' room. With view everywhere. Aha. Yeah. We close the door. Yeah and I think that's quite nice. And then? And put David In a two person office? And why? No, no, the reason to put Pirette and Marianne Marianne and I together is because of the noise we make by receiving students. And then the reason to put David in this office it's because yeah, it's fifty per cent in a three um place office. Um. That sounds nice, no? And I think we do have the best office uh. It's a kind of dictatorship decision, but we are here to make a decision, so And Agnes, you're gonna sell this to the administrator? Yeah. So? The argument of student. Yeah. You can also s oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. is Yeah. Yeah, but we all work on different projects so we can't What is the little square d you put oh, a printer? And the photocopier? Okay. That's quite fine. Student reception. You. Okay. No yeah, that's fine. So the arguments are uh student reception in one corner. Yeah. The fifty per cent staff in the three person room. Yeah. Yeah. And um the two mm and the two professor is one single. Yeah. Centred. And since you nee you will meet the administrator, can we ask for a coffee machine somewhere. Yeah, or in that hall. I mean, the sixth floor, there is no coffee machine on the sixth floor. No no, um a vending machine. Yeah but try. Wi with good coffee. Italian one, please. Yeah. And herb tea. For the afternoon. H herb tea. For the afternoon, yeah. Because with strong coffee I don't t sleep. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Mm. And do we know if there will be air conditioning? No no no, there is no terrace on that building. So, no we're not gonna change the plan only for the smokers. Exactly. As well. I think it's fine. Okay. Is everyone happy with that? Mm. Wow. That's very professional yeah. Hmm. Uh can can we think of putting a white board somewhere in the hall? For general information? Yeah. Yeah, but I mean you have a nice poster of the next conference, you don't put it you know a a big board with Along one of the wall, yeah. Yeah. Mm yeah,.. Ooh. I think it's everybody's responsibility to find if they prefer to be in front of, back to window or whatever. I mean, if we start doing that not happy We are all adults, so I think we can all speak and Uh okay. I hope, yeah. Okay.. Okay.
Not really. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Suzanne, for example. Mm-hmm. So what do you think for uh Susan and Maggie for example the the rooms for one person. Naturally.. Yeah, to I would say not together in a three it's quite a lo yeah, yeah. some. Just yeah. Yeah, it's quite dark. Yeah, it would be nicer. Finally, you think? Yeah, I agree, it's uh You you said that there is electricity. In the Well, let's uh how we can uh fill the three person rooms? Uh how we ge who we gonna put in the three person rooms? I mean we have now a two three person rooms left. And um Yeah, yeah. Mm, we do. Mm. So, where were we? Uh Pierrette, uh Andrei, Nancy? Yeah, why not? All two Mariannes or And you too, okay. So we need a Yeah, I'd like to have a view to the mountains, but well Yeah. Well that's that will do, but uh Yeah well f yeah, it's uh yeah, old town is as well as well yeah, that's alright. Yeah yeah. And that's good, because there are Pirette, Marianne and Nikos they are on the other side of the corridor, so it's yeah. Who is left um who And Yalina, Ya Yalina would be good. And actually she is working for the same project as well. With beautiful laughter. And anyway, Martin is just a fifty per cent.. Okay. That's all? How i how it looks like Yeah, you can Ah. Yeah, uh that was my question. Yeah, I mean with whom you'd you'd to with whom you'd like to work in the same office. I mean, is it important to have someone uh from the same project or um Yeah, we can skive. But you're gonna disturb all the people. We're gonna disturb all the people by skiving all the time. Yeah, that's for sure. With Yeah, I Yeah. I dunno you were saying that uh Maria and Nancy doesn't fit together in the same So what you say if you change the office uh, I don't know, and you work with Nancy or uh What do you yeah, I dunno. For example? Yeah. Sounds okay. What do you say? Sorry? No, what's bothering you? I thi I think And now you are you are changing your mind all the time. Yeah, but if you work with the people like Pirette and Marianne uh Well, at mm Uh well Pirette is having quite a unadvantaged situation, because there are Marianne and Bruno who are having uh reception hours. so it's gonna be a qui yeah, so it's quite a traffic there I would say. No. So well, of course, if they put uh The aim having a room room for reading or Yeah. people. Well, you can you als already speak quite well Finnish, so we might get along, yeah. Yes, I will.. It's easy for them to find the people. It only goes on Yalina. Yeah, we have to from the other side of the But well. Yeah, the people having students. Yeah, if we change the three people, Pirette, Marianne, David David with here and uh Yeah. We got it. W with the mount ah my mountains, yes I got the mountains. And bathrooms are nearby, yeah. Fifty per cent, yeah. Yeah, looks good. Yeah, I think too. I'm quite happy with it. Yeah. Yeah, but it's quite logical to have the for the professors one person rooms, I think. For the yeah. We can skive as you said. Yeah. Person rooms. Mm-hmm. And the projects they're they are quite well grouped actually now. And well Gisella she is kind of in the middle. Yeah, department. In the reading room, that would be good. Oh it's not, ah it's Yeah, good coffee. Yeah. Quite strong, strong good coffee. Uh yeah. Yeah.. If you late uh you work late, yeah. And you drink uh coffee, yeah. Is there actually a smoking uh area somewhere? Not for me but but we okay. We have the terrace still on the sixth floor or uh how how. No. Not at all. They have to go down, yeah.. Yeah, yeah. And Susan, Maggie as well. Yeah, I think it's okay. Let's see what the the other ones say. Three weeks. Okay. My boxes. Ah. Yeah.. That might be a good idea. Well, mai mailing lists. Of course, you can mail em yeah, if you have something. Ah okay, yeah a posters, okay. That's kind of thing. Yeah. Yes,. Or in front of the reading room or Yeah. Mm. No more special wishes. yeah, you know.
Okay. So now that we've all had a bit of time to think about it, um does anyone have any concrete proposals or do we want to just go through people and start placing them and kind of discuss as we go along? Nope. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, give them like the most comfortable offices and Yeah. 'Cause a professor, but he's only here half time, so it's sort of a different situation. And he's a professor at, but not in Geneva, he just does research in Geneva. Yeah. Okay, so let's go through that first. Um Yeah. And for Susan probably yeah, 'cause I think she prefers to have her own office. Um. Okay. Any preferences to which one? 'Kay. I put Susan here for now. And then Maggie in the other one? No, it's up to us. They're not here so Um okay. And then Yep. Um Well, Pierrette has students and Andrei and don't. Well, does Andrei? S he teaches but okay. Yeah. 'Cause also if we're gonna put people together by projects then there's no sense to put them together, 'cause they all work on different projects. Right? Mm? Yeah. 'Cause they'll fight for the window. What about moving Gisella in there? If she's in there half the time, she can have her desk near the window, and okay, she's not near the mailbox, but but it maybe more sort of practical in terms of working environments for people. But again, one of the reasons for putting the reading room where it is is so that you have You think. Yeah. I don't know. Or what if you put What if we put the two people that are fifty per cent in that room? Yeah. But they are only here fifty per cent. So everyone has to go somewhere. And you also have one three person room with two windows. Nikos volunteers. Who you're taking with you? Okay. Well 'kay so let's put David in there, yeah. You'll meet him. Okay. So I'm just gonna make a list on here of who we have. keep talking. with Pierrette. Okay, so David, Nikos, Gisella, Maggie and Susan are done. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Should we be nice and give them three windows? Okay. That won't get confusing. Where? Here? Oh, here. Would have to be here or the other three person room. Pick a room. Well she's not that far if she's like like in this one here. 'Kay so you want this one? Mm. Okay.. Yalina. Yeah. That could work. In room yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm. I guess I can go in there, 'cause Martin and I wor are working on the sort of the same thing. And that leaves And Nancy. Yeah, that's a weird combination. No, it's not that. It's just you've almost got like a project split, except that you don't, because Nancy and Maggie and I work on premindia parmenidy parmenidies. And then Andrei, Martin, Maria and I also work on. And sort of Susan. Although the Susan and Maggie thing we can't really change. No. But then we should split the little party up. All on your own. Hmm. See I would put it the other way. I would put the room with Martin in it in the two window room, 'cause he's fifty per cent, so then at least the other two people get Put Martin in the three person room with two windows. Since he's fifty per cent. Either way. Well I don't know for splitting up people or Well I'm trying to optimise. I don't think it's necessarily so important to be in the same office with someone if you're working on the same project. 'Cause you're too lazy to get up and walk next door. I don't know like right now I share an office with Bruno. We don't work on any projects together. Yeah. Of course. But I mean that's fine. Like I don't need to be in the same office with someone who works on or someone who works on parmenidies. It's not like yeah. Know anything about yeah. You hear things out of context. What? Okay. I just can't really see them sharing an office, I don't know why. Or we put Andrei and Nancy to Nancy together 'cause they're starting that new project. And then put Maria with me and Martha. I can see that working a bit better. Hmm. I thought you were saying you didn't wanna be in a three person room. First of all Yeah. And put David but then you and Nikos have the window problem, which is why I still think we should put Gisella in that room, because it's She gets the window, the whatever, he's there for two months, it's their problem. Yeah. Not for enjoying the view. So Yeah, but if you put So what if we switch no. You have to have a computer with wireless. No. Well, most of us first of all have desktop computers. pick up your desktop and plus you can't assume that you can just use the reading room for reception hours. Right. Like if people are actually using it as a reading room. Yeah.. Can we say we're gonna move Gisella here? And then I think that gives us a little bit more flexibility to play with moving people around. Goes here. You were the first one on the list, but if you wanna remove someone else Yeah. Mm-hmm. So what if we put you with yeah. Will you have. Okay, so I'm just putting Yalina in so we don't Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Or do you wanna go somewhere else? Here. You just don't photocopy. Well you have the other lift. The switch? With here? So like that and then move you to That's what the plan was. From the beginning. Do you get the photocopying noise. Now we are all gonna come photocopy just to annoy you. Okay. Or did was the id I should start start making full sentences. What about I was thinking about moving Pierrette and Marianne into a two person office rather than a three person office. But With Andrei and Nancy, for example. No, in a three person office. Because if they have reception I know, I thought you were saying that Pierrette should have a smaller office, or be in a smaller office, because of reception or something, or did I just completely misunderstand? Okay. Is because he's fifty per cent, okay. Okay, that works. Mm-hmm. I'm going to try. Yes. 'Kay, what arguments do I need? Well, we have the the group and students here. Although you still have Susan and Maggie over here. Yeah. So it is sort of a well, no, it's not a project split. It's weird, 'cause it kind of is and kind of isn't. Because Maria and Martin and I work all work on the same project, and then Andrei and Nancy work on the same project, and Pierrette n yeah. And yeah. Okay, let me just write down the arguments for why um Mm-hmm. You just want a bigger window. Happy? That's noise reduction. Okay. Now they are, yeah. Except for David, but we can't do anything about that. You mean like a little machine or a vending machine? 'Kay. The little machine, I think, would be harder to sell, but. I will. Nespresso? With the good strong coffee. What did you say, hot tea? Oh, herb tea. Nope. Non-smoking building. No, they'll have to go down. And Susan Maggie close enough, yeah. Okay. Yeah, I think so. Just checking if actually have everyone, but I think we do. In was it what did I say, three weeks. As far as I know, yeah. As far as I know basically we pack up one day, the movers come, take all our stuff, put into the red boxes. So when you get there the next day, all your stuff is already in your office. And all the I_P_s and everything is set up. They're trying. So, we'll see. Make sure you label your boxes properly. Um especially the Marianne's. Yeah, so they won't confuse it get confused with the other Marianne's boxes. Uh we can try. I can ask them. But that's not really Um where? Like along Gisella's Yeah. Okay, so Along that bottom hallway somewhere. Okay. Anything else I need to ask them? 'Kay. I don't actually we may need to sort out That's not healthy. Um who I don't know if we need to sort out who sits where, 'cause if they're gonna plug everything and set everything up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, no. Yeah. I just can't remember whether they're actually gonna set everything up for us or not, but we can change it I guess. Okay. That's it then. save this. Yep. Not right now, 'cause I'm not connected to the internet. But I will. Okay. Good, we're done then.
I don't think they are concrete proposals. No. Yeah, this makes sense. Yeah. It's up to them I guess uh. Up to us? Well I mean they they can switch later. They can switch later. Pirette next? Who?. So I don't know, we spent quite some time at the last meeting and t to decide this, and now we are just Of course, but everybody had the documents before, so you could have studied them. So I don't think it's a good idea. Yeah, m W I I I don't mind going into this office. No. Oh, why not? Yeah? No. Maybe we can put Pierrette and her t two two P_H_D_ students into one room? Um yeah, mayb maybe the other one would be more convenient if we are all working on the same project. So we are close by. Mm. Agnes. Yeah. Why? Okay, w w why don't we move Maria to this to where to the office I'm supposed to be and I can go with Nancy? If you think that But is this about windows or is it about it it it must be functional. If you and Martin work on the same project then Yeah, we can each other, yeah.. I agree, but the setup is pretty good now. So Bruno is not on and he's sharing um office? Uh I'm not sharing somebody with I work on the same project, uh um, yeah. Martin and you, yeah. Yeah, what is it now? Bu s somebody has to be Well, will there be wireless in the building? I mean, if there are reception hours, so somebody could move to the reading room, and have people Well isn't this the case? Doesn't everybody has one? No?. Mm. No. Hmm? I have no problem with that. Um. Yeah, who does anyway? So maybe you and Bruno should take this office. Yeah, that's a good idea. And it's not very healthy either, yeah.. Mm. suggestion, if possible, we could move me and Yalina to the office where Andrei and Nancy are now. No, I I just it's just more convenient if I'm closer with my The partners of my project. She's the heart of the. It's not kitchen. Well it's it's ideal for Nancy, she is just very close to the lifts. Excellent, yeah. So when exactly are we supposed to move? Three weeks. So they've set up everything, wiring, uh internet, or what's the sta the status right now? S Well there are lots of walls we can put posters on. Yeah, we don't want to micro manage things, yeah. Can you mail a copy of that to everybody?",IB4002
"Sorry. I don't have my presentation. Um Yeah. So they're on my they're on a. No no. They are. Yeah. No, no. My D_ machine. Yeah. Okay. Just going Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So uh uh yeah. I will do something like that. Okay. So uh I would like just to review at the different project regarding acquisition system. So basically there are five systems. The first one is called SMAC, which is developed by Fribourg and CERN. The second one i is your system. Uh I would to say the cheap meeting room system. The third one yeah, maybe I can share that with you. The SMAC, yeah. Should I write? Okay. The first one is yeah, I will call that A_. SMAC, which is develop by Fribourg and CERN. The second one, B_, which is uh I would like to che say uh cheap uh meeting room or I don't know. Okay. P_A_S_. Okay, P_A_S_. The third one is um Okay. The third one is called uh the s um this is uh the smart meeting room develop at Fribourg which is called the smart It's DIVA. Okay. The p DIVA. D_I_V_A_, something like that. The third one is call uh the third one is uh the project that I have to improve the current smart meeting room at IDIAP. Uh for that we will use um uh Yeah, a tape three uh okay, let's call that. And the last one I would like just mention just to for the meeting and this is uh the fire-wire. Um I don't know if you saw my presentation during my turn. You did you? Uh okay. E_, which is firewire. Okay. So I will start just with the SMAC. So maybe I draw line here. So the SMAC The SMAC project the SMAC project is a project which aims to do the acquisition of audio, video and slide uh for presentation. Yeah, this project is done with Fribourg and CERN. But I'm just going to make a very short um graphic. In fact, they use um a card, a video card which is call um I_V_C_ mm yeah. I just write I_V_C_. In fact, this is a video card with four um inputs. On these four inputs you can have only video. But uh they want to make also the slide acquisition. So on one input they put um a conversion box, a converter, which converts from slide to video. So that mean that we decrease uh the the quality. We have a high quality in slide and we go to low quality to lower quality with uh video. Um so this one is just for the SMAC. Now I will just move. D Yeah. These one are just for video and audio. You can use uh them. And this board does uh the DivX compression on the fly. This is uh the box that we have on the table. The the card that we have on the table. Uh I think Mm. Okay. So the solution to that low quality is uh solved b by you project, the PAS project. Uh uh I make a tick here and I clean up this is just to to solve that pro that problem regarding the slide and the slide resolution. So we remove uh that part. And we call that the PAS. And in that case we use um a frame grabber here. And we go with the slide here. And um of course these two cards will be on the same machine. And uh we have to develop a solution here. The main critical point is here. The synchronisation between these two uh these two cards. And with that this is the card that we use in the smart meeting room and this is uh the card the um. Yeah, these one no no. Th uh this one is and this one the video card. And this one, this is uh the card that we have already at IDIAP for the sli Yeah, yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. So Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So we can have both. We can have the slide from the slide capture and we can just use uh a video signal to to capture that also. To have two t uh mm you wants to ha do you have two quality h high quality and Yeah, we can just take some snapshots. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. With um this one. So yeah you won't yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Something like like say something like that. Yeah. Yep. Yeah, yeah. Ch yeah. Video. Yeah. Okay. So uh I was just talking about the PAS project. Maybe I would like just now to talk about the DIVA project. So I clean up. Yeah. I. There. Um did you read something regarding the DIVA project? In fa yeah, uh we just remember that here we we still have only one machine to do uh the slide, video and audio acquisition. And the DIVA it was uh something different. Fact we have a master machine that's um We have a master machine here. And we have some slaves machine here. We have some connection and here we have some input. We have audio. Usually we have audio. And And the same for this one. And um basically on the slave machine we have two cards, one for audio and one for video. So they develop something to synchronize these two cards together and th uh this is something which is it's more, w which is call uh direct show, uh which allows you to to synchronize uh these two cards together. And but of course you want these two streams to be synchronize. But you want also these two streams to be synchronized. So they have a synchronization between two slaves which is done by the master. Here we just use uh the et ethernet network to synchronize uh these two um these two device. Um I just write. Internet, something like that. And uh they do only audio and video. Uh they don't do any slide. Um Slide acquisition, yeah. Okay? So Yves asked for the DIVA. I would like just to talk now regarding uh the the fire-free smart meeting room at IDIAP. Do you have any question? Or uh. What yeah, tape free, sorry. Tape free smart meeting room. So for that I Yeah. It's yeah. It's a tape free but also video. Uh and the acquisition is done in raw video. So the file is huge and they really need uh um they have a long post-processing to convert raw file to uh DivX or to our own files. Yeah, but it takes time. It it's just just to mention that. Uh so I will write. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So maybe first I will just describe the ma the smart meeting room that we have at IDIAP. In fact we have uh also a master slave architecture. Um I clean a little bit. We have the master P_C_, which take ks uh which takes care about the audio. I clean that. And we have the slave P_C_ which take cares about the white board and the slides. Now if we look at the video If we look at the video in fact um yeah, maybe first I should mention that. Between the master and the slave we have um the mm a synchronization signal which is call time MIDI time code. I just write MIDI. And for the video, we have the video input here. We re-use the um MIDI signal uh with um to insert the time code on each frame. And we save that to D_V_ recorder. Uh I I have video. Okay. Uh we know the problem of that that uh this is that after each meeting somebody has to take care about the D_V_ tapes and to t convert them into DivX. So my idea is to d do something like that, is to develop a s um um uh a video slave machine. May I say something like that, yeah, a video slave machine uh which use the MIDI um which use also the MIDI time code. No, sorry. Sorry, I'm doing something wrong. We have the video here. We just have the time code inserter. So we take that signal here and we move to this uh machine here, which is in fact just uh the I_V_C_ video card. This just an acquisition card. And we com and we s and we convert file directly to DivX. And um so we will have here video. And also because we want to control that machine we use also the MIDI time code the MIDI time code to start and to stop the machine. This is just something uh that uh this just to remove the D_V_ recordings. But um yeah. Just uh this just an improvement of the smart meeting room. Okay. Uh do you have any question uh regarding uh that? Yeah. We don't have to care about the synchronization in that case because the time code is ins serted here. And we take after the time code insertion we take the video signal and we pass through the machine. So uh this is uh a simple solution, but um where we don't have to care about the synchronization. Co yeah. The synchronization is yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the f last one is uh the fire-wire acquisition. Uh I just Okay. Okay. Um in fact the the major problem regarding acquisition system is always the synchronization. And for that fire-wire is good. I mean fire-wire was a project. Now the project is uh stand-by. Uh we don't move to that project. I am but I am just going to talk about this one. Um so with acquisition with acquisition systems uh the major problem the major problem is uh the synchronization. And fire-wire gives you some um some way to be synchronize in fact. Uh this is uh I just want to to describe here the bus. This uh yeah, this is of the bus where you can send you can send some package. And any device we which wants to send a package a p a packet, sorry, should ask um there is a manager of that bus. This just of the bus. Any device which wants to send a packet has to r to r uh require some uh band-width on the bus on the bus. And so after that he will have that band-width. And he will always have that band-width. So um yeah, he will always have that band-width. And so we are sure that we will have a synchronize acquisition with fire-wire. And so so that mean that um Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Uh yeah. Hardware. It's i it's done by it's done by hardware. It's done by hardware. No no no no no. And in fact yeah. I I as I mentioned before, we have a bus manager and the bus manager send just a flag to say now it's time to give me you data, and all devices which have uh required some band-width will send the data. So I'm just drawing something like that. This is this kind of signal that the th bus manager is sending. And just after that bus just after that uh signal all device will send uh the data. So we will have the data from A_, from B_ and from C_ and so on. And after the next one we will have again the um the data from A_, B_ and C_ and so on and so on. And so with fire-wire we are sure to have a um an acquisition system. Now the major problem with fire-wire is that that fire-wire is just an kind of intelligent, uh a smart pipe. A synchronized pipe. We can put what we want inside. So we can put raw data, or we can send a DivX data, or we can send also uh what I uh was presenting in my term presentation was a H_ two six four. But in that case we need something uh hardware here to uncode raw data to a given format. Of course uh the idea is to reduce um the band-width on the bus also. And all data are sent through the master. Do you have any quest Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh in fact the um slide card l sorry. The slide card and the video card are both S_D_K_. So what Yeah. Both are S_D_K_. Yeah. Yeah, y yeah. Yeah, this for that you uh I don't remember by how. No. But Usually audio audio and video should be synchronized. Because uh this just an on an audio video channel. So uh they are synchronize. Um so we can play with the video. We can play with the slide. Uh and after that and the major point is to m combine both. Yep. We we don't have synchronization. We have to find a solution, and for that might be we can use uh direct show, which is a syn which is a technique to synchronize different device. No no. This is just uh an application, which i No, no, no, no, no. No. This not on the card. This just an application that runs on the machine. Um f I think direct show you can download for free. I'm I'm not sure. M I should check. Or Yeah, it m yeah. I think the best thing to do is to have a machine just which is only dedicated to to that. Because uh if you if you if you if you use a machine which has been already used for something else sometimes you have plenty of libraries. And so you you don't know exactly. Maybe it would be better to have just a dedicated machine just for that. Just for Okay. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I I Oui. Because Because I think um the video is done the video compression is done on the on that card and uh I'm not hundred percent sure, but I think the J_ PEG the J_ PEG conversion for the slide capture is done also on the card. So we don't need Ah yeah. Yeah. But I mean yeah. I was just thinking about the the speed of the computer could be lower. Maybe a first so solution will be just to start w with. Because we need to start with something. We have the slide capture from Darren. We have um I will work on the video acquisition for the inpu the tape free smart meeting room. So I will start with that to develop some knowledge regarding that board, uh that video board, and after that we can combine both. No. For not for no no. This not for end of next year. It's too long. And it it's uh it's too long, it's too long. For myself I would like to say uh April, May. April, May we should have results. Uh no no no. Uh I mean the um Uh not al almost uh the uh the the uh the complete application. Maybe some minor will appears. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Uh they have. Yeah, th it's a yeah. But we start with the I_V_C_. We start with the data path. Uh the the slide frame grabber. And after that is and the question is how to synchroni to to to make both card working together. Yeah. Uh I_V_C_ I_V_C_ should go faster. Yeah. I will uh I'm not currently working on it. I will start to work on January on that point. So uh but I think No no. I'm not working. I schedule to to work on that from m Yeah. But I have also a que Mayb But I would like to say uh there is many unknown in that project. But I would like to say we can make uh uh a schedule of that project to just to track to just to see if we track the time table. If we don't we we asks for more people, maybe H_E_V_S_ people, to to to be slightly involved in that project, to be to to respect the date. Yeah. N Yeah. It's too long. No. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But uh at the same time I have some other project I I want to finish uh those project first. But for example, I have uh I receive some new project. I said that I have no time yet. I say I have no time gi now currently I um I say some for some project you say that you don't have time. But people will stay will continue to say no no, you will find time just to do that project. The Yeah. Currently but uh up to December I don't have time to work on it. But I plan already. I I um with I_M_ two I I I did uh I mention that I will have from January two thousand six I will have time for that. Uh I have a No, I will work fully on that on this point. From January two thousand six I wi Maybe a good thing will be to make a plan to to we say we we won't set the deadline here. We are here. We split that part in different segments. Uh y Yeah. Yeah, the yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No. No, no, no. Yeah. Yeah. Which is really bad. Yeah. I I understand exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I understand. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. What Yeah. But I think yeah, that will be good, just to have a plan and to have some deadline in that plan. And as soon as we we we as soon as we we we are not in time, we we we con Yeah. Yeah, and to improve the system like Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh if I if I say until January this is just to finish. Uh I want to have the deadline at end of December to finish all my project. I want to finish all these project when everything is finished. After that I can move to another one. But I don't want to Yeah. No. No. Uh I I don't know regarding H_E_V_S_. I don't know if this is uh still in time. But you can have you can ask for a student, a d a diploma work.
With the lapel. So we I think we organise uh just to to discuss uh To discuss uh, yeah, the project Alexandre and uh Jean-Marc uh proposed a about uh capturing uh audio, video and slide uh in a synchronized way. And so we will start with uh an introduction. Uh I think Olivier prepared some slides about uh reviewing uh current systems. And um And then, even if we don't have many things to to talk about, just to to start discussing about clearly the project and also um dealing with our kind of timing constraints. And uh The U_ U_S_ U_ uh U_S_B_ cord doesn't work? And you didn't put on the Maybe you can access through the network. If it's on your H_. Or it's on uh your D_ machine. So maybe we wi we will be able to. Should work. What? So um w yeah, we had like five slides y uh presenting different systems. And mayb maybe you we can do that at the white-board. I it's a bit stupid. But uh y you know. I think you remember well the different uh parts. And uh I'm sure uh we can do that at the white-board. Yeah, it would be great to use the white-board. So the the the first one is uh SMAC. Okay. Yeah, maybe yeah. Just a review of current systems uh to introduce. Well, cheap meeting room is the, you know, mm it's a conference room? Or Yeah. PAS. Alexandre. PAS. Yeah. P PAS project. Smart mediat uh Smart Minutes, but uh I thi Diva. Because a Sma yeah, Smart Minute is all the process of capturing the minutes automatically. But it's Diva we can say. Free. Mm. Doesn't matter. Yeah. And this the three of those are the v the the video And uh I'd like to add that this c I think it's quite ambitious project because it's with uh the CERN. And they w they uh already worked on uh a European project called InDiCo, where they they have uh release, deliver, a full um kind of conference uh uh software. And uh to to manage uh all the the conference aspects uh uh we have in a conference automatically. And uh I know that at Fribourg they installed uh already in in a in a big uh amphitheatre for students. And I guess it's currently working. Ah no. Either just to uh in parentheses uh we didn't choose that um that solution because they had no um the the slides were not captured very uh in a very uh precise way. That's the point. Okay. Otherwise they uh it's fully automatic? Or have have you discussed with them? Did you discuss that? Is it fully automatic? You don't know? Okay. But the p i But i i it all synchronize and i is it doing all what we want but without the slide uh precision? Okay, yeah. Yeah. And uh okay. And we are su and we are sure that in that uh context of SMAC project with uh um Fribourg working on document analysis uh there were not enough precision un enough resolution in the slides? Mm yeah. Okay. Talk conference.. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm.. Okay. Mm-hmm. To c to capture Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah.. Yeah, different requirements. Mm-hmm. Hmm. So you you would you c you can uh link like this? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Tape free. Tape free. D_V_ tape free. Yes. Mm-hmm. And that's what you they use more or less in T_N_O_ also. They didn't have uh tapes. But with different cards. They had something. For the AMI project. Hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Because the synchronization problem comes from the the grabbing from the D_V_ tape in in d in D_ Vix. So it's afterwards. Mm. Oh no, it's impossible, yeah. Mm they didn't have too much fun grabbing. The problem is was that it was not synchronized. So the time code was wrong for for the different videos. They had the uh uh at the beginning of the video, you if you saw the time code, it was six hours ni uh fifty minutes. And h there four hours thirty two minutes. So it's it was a problem with the time code. Well, that's what they did uh manually after the afterwards. But they didn't have too much frame drops in fact. No, they d yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure. Because Well, it's manual to to synchronize it, the frame. Yeah, that's what they did. No no, because uh we did the software here and it they didn't choo no our uh software. Packet. And this is no no no.. And this is done at the um you have libraries, et et cetera to to choo well uh a all you you are saying about uh asking about band-width, et cetera. It th when y uh you use a system um hardware. Yeah, yeah. So we don't have to code all the communication process, et cetera. So just for explanation. Mm-hmm. Yes. Okay. Yeah. So we need uh well, this is will be done together t like in to to try to divide the time uh what do we do. Um we we don't want today to to put deadlines, you know. But um what we have, what we can do and how we will be able to do, I was thinking uh for instance uh in th in what we have um uh because I don't know a lot about um using uh like uh D_L_L_, M_F_C_, uh uh Microsoft software. But I'm very happy to to go with that. And uh so what we have until now is the software that Darren did for the frame grabbing. And and actually I c um I can start playing and uh looking at the this uh in detail. So Darren software About um frame grabbing. Sup I suppose M_F_C_C_ no uh, not M_F_C_C_ but M_ e M_F_C_. You heard of that. And uh D_L_L_, et cetera. The all the Windows uh uh pro programming. Um so this is one uh step. Then um the audio video card um so so uh first uh we need to look at this, to look at the demos that are uh i with the what they call the S_D_K_ uh software development kit. Uh demos, test. Um testing the card with uh only one audio for instance and then only one video. And e even uh testing with only the slides uh to capture all the uh like what you were saying, the the s uh the video s uh stream. Well, slide stream. The frame You mean the frame grabbing card? Yeah. They have S_D_K_ uh software development kit that is based on uh M_F_C_ libraries and C_ plus plus libraries. Okay. Okay. So once you we've tested the individually the card, we can test to synchronize the audio and the video together? Or is it no, it's synchronized? Or okay. Okay. Okay. And the i th now we are, as you said uh what not now but uh the next point would be to use that card with the other card and to merge the slide signal with the, well, um the s uh yeah, the synchronization signal coming from the frame grabbing card. It's uh it's it's not a synchronization signal, it's a slide with a t Oui oui. Yeah, we will. And is is it external to this card? It's external? Or it's i So it's external. It's not in this uh card. And we don't have to buy that? Or well uh to to uh at least the basic. Okay. And that will will uh will be will help us to synchronize the this frame grabbing card and this video card. So uh t yeah, we need to do some tests. Reading and yeah. Okay. And then when we have okay. Where do we do that? He we don't know yet with Frank if we install this card maybe here. Okay, and at IDIAP it's possible there. Okay. Mm-hmm. Well on my machine, his machine or this machine maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. issue. So yeah. Uh uh mm. Yeah, Christmas two seven. No no. Um yeah, that's good question. Yeah, Alexandre did not care too much about the way uh you i no no no, but uh you are more in research. Mm-hmm. Okay, I said at the beginning of the meeting that mm uh well we're not d doing deadlines. But uh yeah. Mm yeah. No, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Ye well, we would look both at. Because we are also both uh quite busy with other projects of course. Uh e H_F_E_S_ database uh with J_ Ferret uh Okay, this is between both. Yeah, of course, yeah. Ready to be used. Yeah. So uh Data. Mm-hmm. Yeah, we yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So yeah. Let's see. From fro for checking Darren's code, et cetera we can expect until uh And yeah, for o one months or so, then uh the uh the i uh I_V_C_ uh w with the people at Fribourg have uh yeah, okay, so uh at Fribourg we we have Mm-hmm. Okay. And then the direct show. Or yeah. So we can say we try to to make something for April. But uh well I I want this to to work in the for the time uh in the mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh i mm-hmm. The Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. O one student or yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And we can ask help uh Mm-hmm. I it's too late in terms of research uh mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No no no no. We understand that you we cannot wait uh we were here one year ago uh, I don't know, and also when it's was uh going uh the idea was appearing and Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Personally I want to be involve in that project. A acquisi uh some mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. With I_M_ two, I_P_ one. Mm-hmm. Fifty percent on on I_M_ two, that's it. It's fifty percent, no? On I_M_ two I_P_ one? Okay, maybe in fifty percent uh on that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Why this was, yeah, mo yeah w I don't want to talk too much maybe. Uh but uh with Sebastien, sorry this was maybe uh his concern. And yeah, Bastien is busy with uh annotations plus all kind of things. Uh maybe we can in the process we can ask for someone more. To work on that. Well uh uh that's what I I was Y That's what I was trying to do and I before coming here I just tried to to make uh uh a plan. But I don't answer, yeah. W well the let's say uh April O_ six and uh we do uh our best with uh trying to keep you inform with the advancements. And if we see early that clearly uh there i Mm-hmm. And it should be someone with experience in C_ plus plus M_F_C_. Uh Yeah. Or a student. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No, no, no. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm.. Mm-hmm. Well I would like to to to work on p kind of part time uh uh w o yeah. Yeah. And one full day a week. And I would okay, maybe you won't like my answer but I would say that um we ch we we start but we h we really have to start on working wi uh reading all the code from Darren. Then this um card with the code, I_V_C_ card, and to to try this. Then we try a little bit direct show to see um uh to to have an idea of how how long uh that could be. And then at the moment we can say okay we need someone to help us. Well, w uh let's do that. Let's do that. Okay. Fo Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, yeah. To So without direct show you mean the frame grabbing signal and time alignment? Uh wi that would be done uh in like in common software that we have uh afterwards? Okay th and this point is about testing and uh yeah. Okay. So you could say okay, let's for Christmas let's try this without the all the synchronization. Uh with direct show issue. Okay oh yeah, you are you cannot or o l uh by doing one one day a week, mm you know just I think the cards. Okay. Anyway, the recording is finished, I think. Yeah. So I try my best until January. And um and I try to do what Jean-Marc uh described to give you a first feedback on the different cards. Uh and uh and from there it would m yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I would say uh let's let's yeah, let's try to have one uh students uh to help us on that. I don't know. That is very well, we have to choose whether the students it's too it'd be stupid. But uh uh the the student should have knowledge about M_F_C_ with oh okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Doesn't mean that we d we have to to stop talking yet. But uh the recording has finished.
. The show must go on. You can say then you It I th I thought it was called PAS, so I think just use this. PAS. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Well I suppose uh I suppose they can capture things, right. I mean don't s I don't see why you could not capture the videos I mean with a card like this. I don't know. I mean I don't know. Well as far as I as far as I know, I mean they do of course they can do of course slide detection. Change slide change detections which uh of course what I understood is also they try to recover the layout somehow. I mean given the slides but they are in no case they are extracting the text from the slides. So with in uh in uh all the cases what I've seen, in all the cases I've seen I mean they s assume that at least you have like a P_D_F_ version of the document or what. And basically they try to match what is displayed to the document. So first they need to extract the information from the document, which is not does not seem to be so trivial, at least for uh because they're also working with uh maybe more complex documents with images and text and so on. Maybe with slides it's ea it's easier to extract uh the information. I assume it's ea it's easier indeed. But they uh assume basically uh that they have this document, which is something somehow we would like to relax uh because uh people uh like in it's you may not want each time to ask the person. Maybe the person has a point point, not the not a P_D_F_ version. Or maybe he's using Excel to do a demonstration or something like this and we'll want to avoid this. Mm. Mm. But but most you would say most most of the points for us I mean would be valid. I mean slide transition we would use slide uh need to do it slide transition. To some extent we would like to extract some elements of the layout to disting to have a more high analysis. But we would like to do this more automatically and in particular for the text recognition to do to be able to do retrieval uh of slides or points. I mean of parts of presentation. We would like not to have to rely, yeah, to a first P_D_F_ version or any version of the document. So yeah. So the c you have bought this card, right? I mean you say this is a card. No no. Yeah. But I mean this one is the I_V_C_. Okay. So what I want to say is on this card there are four inputs, right? Okay. Not n so enough uh well, yeah, yeah. I was thinking to some extent nothing would would prevent us uh from also acquiring the slide, but really the slide stream from from this card indeed. Right? Or Yeah. Okay. To capture the slide. Yeah. Okay. Well, I mean just because we cannot rec uh we can w something we cannot do with uh it seems for with the high q quality uh capture uh device is to have a stream. I mean the stream. Right, the full stream. So we can tape snapshots. So basically it might be interesting to have still um uh the s uh the slide stream so that for instance if we detect there is a new video that is displayed also on, to some extent we could just cut this videos to keep it and to be able to replay it uh later on and so on. And maybe indeed if for instance the slide stream on the on the right is automatically synchronized with the other parts of the video, it may be easier to s to uh synchronize directly by some some matching process. The slides, the high quality measures we have here, we've directly yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So at least uh this is not at the electronic level. But you would say as a contents from the content level, doing an alignment from the slide stream and from the snap-shots we would have on the other side w is something that might be possible. Of course if we have some, you know, some constraints given by the electronic, I mean it's that's better. Uh because of course first the process is going to be easier and it may be just a few signals that we have to align on the other parts. But I think I could see I could imagine that this could be a reasonable process to do. And it especially because this would solve some of the issues regarding I mean like the possibility of d of displaying videos after from from what we record. So yeah. Well, this is more or less what we just discussed, right, if I understand So like the Diva project is a tape free, already smart meeting room, huh? Okay. But this can be done automatically, right? I mean is the okay. So at T_N_O_ they have something? Ah, okay. Okay. Yeah, okay. No. No, that's what I was thinking. Yeah, so currently because there is a time code, uh video time code, you don't care about the frame dropping I mean because anyway, in each in the video signal, it is encoded the time, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Well, but you don't I mean at this point you don't really care because I mean in the signal you can extract the time. I mean the time stamp is i in the signal. So if you drop some frame, which happens sometimes when you do compression or acquisition uh you you uh ev you will automatically find this in uh the signal, right? I mean it's encoded in the in the image. So you can you can do it. Otherwise uh if there is some frame dropping, you have to rely on the number of frames you are counting more or less I suppose to to assess it. Uh so you have you have some problems then, yeah. Okay. Which i which was more or less T_N_O_ S problem with respect to frame dropping, right? Yeah. Well I think if it was not a problem of frame dropping, the alignment would have been quite easy to to do. And the Really? Well, so it was not such a difficult process then. Yeah, but if it's only to find uh one of set, you have to find some exa some examples. But I I had the feeling that they had also some frame dropping that was uh no? Okay. Okay. Then that's fine. Yeah, but maybe there are already some machines, you know, uh uh. Uh Yeah, I mean just that, you know, if of course you don't want to have a c other libraries that may, you know, conflict with the one you are trying to use. At the same time, yo see, if you crash a machine I mean because you are doing some test, you may not want to have what's on your machine I mean to uh to be to be uh de erased or whats whatever. So I think it's so maybe there is a machine I don't know whether for this you need, you know, a very powerful machine and so on. But maybe there is a possibility to use a current machine which is only u yeah, that's is withdrawn from the network or yeah. The card. Yeah. But still, I mean even if it's done on the card, you need to basic thing you need to check is um is a bus, right? I mean the bus writing, I mean the speed of uh the bus. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So C_P_U_ itself may not be so. The access, yeah. So can we expect a Christmas uh gift? Uh Mm. For instance I mean the test of looking at their entry goes point by point. So looking at their code I mean uh so you said you would look at this, right? Or is it okay. 'Kay. Well uh Because I mean I mean the I_V_C_ system, I mean it's uh i so my feeling is that I mean people have expertise in this, like in Fribourg also. So I mean I don't think it should take a lot of time I mean just to look at this, right. I mean at least one month seems to be uh quite enough for this, right. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because anyway, this is what you are working on, right? Is the I_V_C_, but using the signals that are coming I mean so basically it's using the I_V_C_ okay. Okay, so currently you are not working on this. Okay, then we need Yeah, that that's that's so that's one of the issue I mean that uh maybe uh,I don't know w whether you realise, but of course if we have this in two years, maybe okay, it's good we have it. But of course it's it's on the it's too long I mean in terms of in term of research, in terms uh maybe even in terms of innovation I mean if you think about this, which is, you know, what uh they said. I mean he was speaking about innovation. This is probably one, an innovation. And the the I know I'm we we see quite well why is working on this, right. But in two years, you know, if we want to do if we want to build a C_T_I_ or transfer technology and something like this, you know, maybe you c of course, okay, people will say yeah, but there is already something that people have started to put on the market and so on. So it maybe not the it's it's too late uh to to do it. So I think this is really so this is one of the points, respect to research of course, it's I think it's going to appear more more and more, and uh Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Because when when you say here now no, I'm not going to start to working on this before January, for me this surprises me to some extent, you know, I'm uh I thought I mean you would you would be working on this. So if you say okay, now it's uh yeah. No, uh oui. No, I mean the point is that Olivier will r you have I mean s since one year uh you have always been saying that you want to be involved in this and so on. So it seems that it has never been a priority. So that that's uh that's the point. So if you have no time to put priority at some points and this seems to have been the case during one year on this project, I mean you need to say it now. I mean that's the point now. So this is Franck At least uh say this to us and we'll see uh with Franck. And again, I mean this is a question. So now you are saying you have no time. So now you say to us. So now we understand and we are maybe after, when we if we discuss with Franck uh Franck Crittin or uh uh Frank uh Formaz and we'll see okay and go and try to see. Okay apparently uh he has no time to to work on this. So we think it's important and we'd like to to do something. So what kind of solution, as Alexandre mentions, i do we need to take somebody, do we want to do we need to take some intern to work on this, uh and so on and so on. Do we take to have uh somebody uh for contract, even if it's not an intern but take somebody for six months to work on this. I mean but so this a point. I mean uh y I don't know about the other projects you have to do. I don't know with who you are discussing about the time you are you can s uh s spend on each of the project. But if y because now you are just telling us you have no time indeed to work on this, right? Okay, so so okay. Yeah, but I mean c it's yeah, but Well I mean uh I mean you have people that are aware of uh M_F_C_, I mean I mean people uh I suppose at H_U_V_ there are some people uh where I was in Le Mans in the U_ B_ uh I mean there uh would be obviously some some students uh that would be aware of and that could be able to handle this. I mean they are working with software and hard both our software and hardware. Uh I'm I'm sure the s se Because uh so so Olivier says it's not before January on his side. So I'm not sure about uh on your side, whe what's your yeah. Like what? One day a week, uh something like this? But Because uh because there are there are several issues I would say. Like if there would be a machine like this, with the two cards separated as I mention. I mean if we record le the flow of the video for instance and the snap-shots from the slides to some extent there is some possibility of doing some automatic alignment without having a special, you know, synchron so this means that to some extent we could have a device which would not yet be fully synchronized and, I don't know, we've uh you know very well done uh code in terms of sending signals and so on. But that might be sufficient, because I mean it synchronize up to, don't know, five seconds. And you would say five seconds may seem a lot for audio and video. But maybe f respect to slides and the rest is not is something that may be tolerable. So still we would be able to start doing some recordings and maybe uh doing even the automatic alignment, or at least we would have an idea about, you know, what are the problems in terms of alignments. Uh do do because it's not like with microphone arrays where you would need micro-second alignments, of course. Uh or even maybe with we want video where it may be one or two frames, I don't know. So this is really some somehow I mean the uh the the issue, I mean I'm sure that there are plenty of possibilities to do things. And the goal would be that indeed we could start uh rec doing some of the recordings of the time so that indeed we would already we uh we would have uh something where uh we could uh start getting the data. Because after, I mean even if it there, we cannot put all the times in one week, right. I mean so and uh so I mean this is uh this is one of the issue as well, which is to have it so that we can play and we can make a nice demo and so on with the full uh thing and something. So f the other part is to have a system which from which we can already record data and with some approximation. And I have the feeling, given the descriptions that you made, that to have such a system wouldn't require a six months of work because basically their own code is there to some extent and uh the I_V_C_ is something quite standard from which we could ask I mean even we could even pay maybe pro some people from Fribourg, I don't know, I mean to come here and to and to help us with the installation on a computer and uh and uh to to to get the so I have more the feeling that this is something that could be done almost in one month. Again, I'm not speaking about the synchronization I mean as Yeah, I mean the two yeah, yeah. Yeah, the for instance a simple question maybe you can are we sure that it can work on a single computer? I don't know. I don't know. I mean is there any uh issues with respect to this? So this is yeah. So it doesn't require it it's more testing it does not require so for this we I mean if you put the two cards on the computer, you put the two then you you basically you say play on the both sides and you look whether at the end you have uh a recorded signals which is is is uh the time that it should uh be and uh or whether I mean the fact that whenever I mean the slides is doing some uh processing uh it there is some and there is some frame drops or things like this. So this is uh Ah. Mm-hmm. I'm I'm wondering whether still we could ask for to get an intern for this. I mean uh Yeah, this is uh still uh even even the non-diploma work. I mean the things we could ask uh but I would yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Well you Yeah, that's that's the issue. Yeah. Well, but yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think it's Uh
Mm-hmm. Keep going. Yeah, yeah. Sure, that's interest us. It's okay. It should. But for the moment just for the purpose well, f for the moment it's just to understand each other so we know we know that the uh Yeah for with PAS. It's okay. Yeah, good idea. Uh this sounds like Alexandre pas. Yeah that's not that It's Diva. N'est-ce pas? Something like this. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I don't know. Mm-hmm. But l let be careful. There's one important point. The technical aspects of the way you acquire things should be driven by the kind of processing you want to have. So in our case we need to have a good processing of slides that in our case it means to transcribe with an O_C_R_ and then make indexing. We need to have high resolution image. I guess that's what you mean by precision, right? So in a sense that's the point. For us we need to have uh this sufficient resolution images of slides to do what we want to do. So that's why I guess we don't follow that solution. Because apparently yeah. Mm-hmm. As far as I know so far uh they did similar works on meetings, document centred meetings. They always worked on manual transcriptions of documents. So they never really took into account a possibility of actually performing processing on the document they talk about during the meeting during in this case the uh the talk, the conference, the the th the presentation. As far as I know. As far as they published I kn I know the results they published uh so far. So essentially they n never took into account I mean the work at the high level, which means basically we have the information coming from here and there. And we n created techniques that allow to starts from the text there and the things that are said and w if we find context, I mean they make some kind of processing. But as they don't work on the low level so low level it means basically okay, take the speech and extract the transcription. I take the image uh of the document and I take the transcription. They basically don't really care of this aspect, as far as I understand, mm. As far as I know. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Let's say that it makes uh less automatic in the sense that at point you need someone giving the file and putting the file upload in somewhere, et cetera. And it is a different kind of processing. Some way is always driven by w what you're able to do. They work a lot on layout analysis. I know they match uh uh the layout in two X_M_L_ files, et cetera. So it's a different way of approaching the problem, which means a different way of capturing different exigencies in in capturing the the documents, yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I it's the same as as you have in the picture, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yep. Definitely. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Acquisition. Mm-hmm. Tape free. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm yeah. Now basically we have all this kind of general view about all the systems maybe we can take this opportunity to come back to our system. Because you know we had there are mm we had the long discussion and finally we decided for for one approach. And maybe take the opportunity to look just a moment uh at what point we are and w when we plan basically to get something uh done and working. I can add to that list of project is something that Jean-Marc and me we have found in the literature. There is F_X_ that is doing something very similar to to what we do here basically. A capture through the projector signal of the slides and they for the moment they just plan to use the slides as a as a way to index the presentations. But but uh roughly is is an idea that is very similar to to our idea. So well essentially now we have the material as far I'm as I'm understood. Uh and it's up to you to tell us roughly when do you think uh we're gonna have something working. Mm-hmm. Issues, yeah. Mm careful because the uh I listened to Frank, and apparently don't want to buy a new machine before we show that this works. So we have to use material that is already available. Maybe there is some free ma machine that is not Okay, s so it is possible to use other machines actually, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Some of uh some other machine, yeah. Mm-hmm. So mm in terms of time what we can think? When we can expect to see Christmas gift or early New Year gift. Uh But the way of course I'm I I don't know exactly what uh the work involves. So is this uh no that's not that I don't care. But uh I d I don't understand some way exactly. I think the the the real point is when. roughly. I mean I I don't say well no, no, no. I don't wanna put a deadline. Uh but uh given the current uh material we have um mm given your activities because I know that you both are involve in many other things. So it's something that you yeah, as Jean-Marc said, is Christmas and uh so we're happy with the Christmas gift. Or is something that you say is Christmas two thousand six. So I I I definitely just want to know something very rough on when you expect to finish this. That's problem. Uh that's that's a problem. I mean do you think it's something for the very next months? Do you think it's something for the end of next year? Do you think sp Mm. So is for so half next year. So June June June two thousand six. Re results, what does it mean? The end of this? So it works, it doesn't work. You know, for for me what is important is when it is ready to be use. So when I can say start collecting data, uh I start using. I start playing with this. Basically the process is ready and we can start having our demo. And also because there is a risk that uh we submitted a project, maybe it will be rejected we don't know, but potentially we are going to have a student supposed to work in this. It will be no not before April two thousand six anyway. But uh you know, mm some way we we we we cannot have a students and make him wait one year before he has uh the material to work. So my point is when. Reasonably. Uh roughly, I don't don't don't wanna have and it's not a deadlines, oui. But when do you expect to have the system ready to work uh working. Yep. Mm-hmm. Together. So this seems to be the main problem as far as as I understand. Mm-hmm. Uh make something re that you are using very vague expression. Result, make something. Just just uh just tell me when it is ready. And if you think it's it's not before uh but but must be reasonable I m I mean if you think it will be not before December two thousand six, say December two thousand six. So don't try to tell me March or April i w if you already know that it is unrealistic to say that. Must be realistic. you say June two thousand six we know it is June two thousand six. Uh I know. Sure. Sure. But Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well but there is no day to respect. It's just to know I mean and if you can have early early warnings in the sense that if you see that there is a major uh problem somewhere. But is just to know in the sense that really uh this p this mm thing has been stop now for quite a long time. Uh uh it n it took a long time to decide what kind of material. Now we have it. It's something that uh is a pretty good idea. We see that other people are working, et cetera. We are going to lose it some way if uh if we don't put some and very honestly yeah. I i it'll it'll not be This is innovation, yeah. Uh you know in a sense I never tried for example eventually to ask for one person dedicated to this because I always had the feeling that you are very interested, you wanted to do it, it's something you some way you uh I mean it seems to be something that is interesting to you. But uh if you have not the time and the possibility to do it because you you both are involved in many other things, we can eventually try to ask to have one person, to involve one person that will be dedicated strictly to this. We can try. I mean we can ask uh uh in the sense that if it is a priority for IDIAP so far we would get very good signals from that point of view, I I don't know. But uh please, if you think you don't have the time or the energy to do it, uh or it involves too many things that you cannot keep under control given the other things you have to do, uh don't think that okay, something nice we we can wait or sooner or later it will happen. Uh yeah. Exactly. So I think it's the moment uh for you to really realise try to to have a realistic uh date. And if you think there are too many things that you risk to lose control, uh tell it now. And we can try to say well we want to do it, but uh basically Mael and Olivier were the person mm-hmm. No, no. But but you can be involve in a different way. I mean you can eventually have uh a supervision role in the sense that you think that I I know how to do it, I like to do it, but I have no time. Because at a certain point it's a matter of time. We can try to to ask. Uh but uh please just don't keep this as a kind of thing, yeah, I like to do it, I like it, it's nice, et cetera. Yeah. Yeah, bu but but here you have to take a responsibility. You can't say I like to do it and but then ah but I will do it when I can. Exactly. Mm-hmm. Uh yeah yeah yeah.. Okay, this is yeah. No, no. Okay so now is your responsibility to say I cannot find time. If you can't find time, you have to say it now. And this is also for you. I mean i it's not an accusation. We we are all in the same condition. Mm-hmm. Exactly. Mm-hmm. S s So let me pose the question very broadly. Do you think that we have a person that has this will help you? We can ask, we can try to ask maybe if some person for six months so that your role is simply to help and advise. We can try to ask. I mean. S I'm sorry, but you still don't answer to my my question. You are not answering my question. Yeah. Let me pose again the question very clearly. If I go to Herve, I can try and say we are in this situation apparently. Why don't we take one person three months, six months, four months that directly advised by Olivier and uh and we can speed up. Consider that it can be difficult of course to find them et cetera and so on. Do you think it's an option? Mm-hmm. At each. Yeah, I think there are people yeah. Do you think it's a reasonable option? Do you think it's something that uh can help you? Because that's just a matter of responsibility for you guys to but there is nothing bad if you say you have other things to do. Because we are all uh full of work. This is something that is added on the top. Uh if you don't have time you don't have time, guys. I mean this is uh but please just tell me. We will find the time however. So April O_ six you will have your system. Or no we are not sure. We don't really know. Uh it can happen that we don't. We don't know what you are going to find on the way. Maybe we think it takes one week and then it takes one month. Uh w we don't know. Uh maybe we will s we wi will not able to be continuous. Because one of the wrongest thing is to work one week, then one month, no, et cetera. That's it's something that breaks. I mean difficult, huh? Mm so that's the point. So that which doesn't mean you are excluded f from the thing in the sense that in any case someone will ask will have to advise the person eventually. And it can't be him, it can't be me. It can be you that basically follow, advise, helps. But at least the mass of the work will be done by someone else that can spend a hundred percent of time on that. Now it's not even guaranteed in the sense that I can ask this. I can say that well this is the situation and uh you are. Or eventually yeah, someone can say okay now this become your priority. Forget about everything else and go with that. I don't know. Or will tell you okay, uh January two thousand six, but from January two thousand six you do nothing else than this. You know, w we can find the time, whether it is your time, whether it is the time of someone else. But uh I really would like to stop with this because this has been for several months that you say we like, we want. And I'm sure, I believe you. But then it is always something that must be done outside uh the uh normal activity. Um I'm uh I'm sorry. Yeah. But but uh otherwise I mean, as you say, to do it in two years p So what do you think? You like that I try to to to solve this problem and try to say that there is a time problem and you don't have the time to do it? Okay. But that can be. But uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It can be tolerable, yeah. Yeah. Exactly. It's a very good idea, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. Uh i no. Let me That seems to me clear. Until January is uh is busy. So So yeah. Just to go to a conclusion, because apparently yeah. So it can't work uh yeah, exactly. Can't work uh until January. So it's up to you. It's up to you to evaluate, yeah. Mm-hmm. And then we d make a decision in the sense whether you continue working or we try to find the time in a different way or we try to eliminate your other priorities you're under. Hmm? Yep. I think that's that's a different problem. The problem is really up to you guys, whether you think it's good to have one person. Try to have that because uh I cannot say we have tried to have W exactly, it wi but better no person than a bad person anyway. Yeah. Okay.",IN1014
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So so m so I assume that well once you've that sort of information, you well you got the G_D_F_ format. You then filter it to say, right, between time X_ and time Y_ they're they're constructing that having triangle one to the construct. And then you just say in that time period, what percentage are they looking at triangle one. What percentage are they looking at the construct. Does that sound does that sound reasonable? Yep. Yeah, Right. Right. Yeah, all all the all events have a start time and an end time. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.. Okay. Yeah 'cause I think that that's gonna co that's 'cause b the diagram we got there suggesting that they're only looking thing at time. So whether it's triangle or whatever else. But so what you're suggesting there is they can be looking at the triangle and maybe a mouse pointer and maybe an eye at the same time. Okay, okay. Yeah. Yep. Yeah, yeah. 'Cause you get c 'cause you Yep. Yeah. Yep. Yep, yep. Okay, yeah. So so yeah. So so it's just a matter of adding these, the two mouse pointers and the um two gazes as extra objects. Um so yeah. As long as as long as they've got an I_D_ in there we can just say right at this p between these times they're looking at that object or they're looking at the mouse, they're looking at whatever. Yep. Yeah. Pens. I confuse 'em. Yeah. that would Yeah. Yeah. Well thing is that with Yeah.. Yeah. thing thing is W_G_D_S_ formats is wor is working at the moment. It's actually got a separate track for each part. So Yeah. Well the Well the the the it depen depends on the depends on what you build in. There's different parts there's different parts whether you're doing the tamgram or whether you're doing an airpa airplane or whatever. Um But th but sa but thing is if if we if we got if we got tracks for each for each part we can we can easily analyse it down later on. Yeah. Yeah, well the Yeah. Yeah. Well the the the the doesn't really list part in the in the G_D_F_. Um so yeah. That that that's not a problem. There so that bas basically what I've got is well there there there's places where you got the I_D_ though. So you've the an I_D_ for a part, you got an I_D_ for a location on the screen. So it shows you the target, config the clock, whatever else. Um and then we can easy add I_D_s for the two mouse points and the two gazes. Um and from that and ba basically all all the all the tracks are doing is saying at this between this time there's a look at this o this object. Yeah, th this I_D_. Um so uh so it's effectively a track for each I_D_. The th yeah the but but Well wha wha what happen what happens there is that the the two the the existing parts basically cease to exist and a new part with a new I_D_ starts existing at the point where they're joined. Yep. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, that that that that's what that's what that's the way he's working the moment. Because it uh th it's it's generating a new I_D_ when you c when you create a new part. Um Yeah. Um yeah. But there there's there's joint events. So if the if a joint event if if if it's there's joint event linked to linked to the item then you know it's become part of a construct. Um of um Yeah, the the the yeah. The con the con the constructs are already tagged with that. So that I'm act there's actually a s a separate file of the data format which says for each construct, which which two parts made it made that came together to make that construct. Yeah. But you can still ta you can still track what parts went into it. So you can still find triangle one, whatever. Yeah. Yeah. But but that's easy n uh it's easy to do because the the co each construct has the I_D_s for the pa the things that construct it. Yeah. Yeah. Well we'll d yeah well with the yeah d well thing is that we we still have the X_ wa the X_ wave traces from the ASCII formats. So if if you want if you want to be able to say I'm looking at a square instead of I'm looking at the construct, that's it is possible to get that data out. Um it's it's yeah. It's it's not doing it's not doing it in the gest analyzer at the moment. But I can easily add it to give that information if you want. Yeah, if if you take it if you t if you crea if you create a new part, it uh it gets a new I_D_. So if you get if you drag a new part out of the parts bin Uh Yeah, I mean the we e Yeah, I mean you know whi you know which way they match. So you can Yeah, the Yep. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah, so I think that anything's loading. There's there's then two triangle, isn't there? There's two identical triangles in the tamgram. Um Well yeah yeah. When you when you specify the molds in the in the in the p the file that c that generates the parts, like a list of parts, the molds are bas just taken out of the the file that generate that specifies the parts. So so ho however many part however many mo however many parts there are in the file, that's how many parts appear in the in the parts box. If you have five black triangles gonna be five five parts in the fi five black black triangles in the parts box. But what what what but what you can do well if in the in the initial configuration you can re-use a triangle. So if you so if you only want one black triangle, you just create one black triangle in the parts box and then re-use that pa that triangle five times in the configuration. Yep. Yep. Well when the when the f when the final construct the the way the the way the the constructs are defined in the file, you've got like your p your parent construct and the parts that it's constructed out of. Um and yeah, as I say, the Yeah, yeah. So you got parent child relationship and i the child can be a part or it can be another construct. Yeah, yeah. 'Cause uh there's a joint action. The result the t what you need for a join action you need to yeah, a construct and a part, two parts, whate whatever you're taking together. And then the result of that is a construct. You've got time when that happens. You can see that construct appeared at that time. Um and you can still track the children of that construct. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, well by by the by the time by the time they're doing that they must have already broken something. So you'll so you'll know what they're replacing. So Uh they do. If if if what if one if one person's trying to get a part to a part that isn't that that so the part that's just sitting on the screen that's not being touched. They both break. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh well yeah. 'Cause yeah. C 'cause it was through the rotational part. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I'm I've th I've yeah. It's it's in the documentation. But it's like two thirds of the way down a quite a long page. So Yep. But um Yeah. Yeah. No. No the the the there's there's very small graphical bugs. But it's it's not it's not big thing. It's like couple of white pixels uh in the course of a in the course of a the course of a task. So it's there's distracting. No. Yeah, but then the que the que the question is there a licence for Camtasia where you just need one editing c thing and two recording things. 'Cause yeah, the r the recording yeah, the recording thi pro program is just quite a it's quite a small program. They just gen it just generates the video and so I don't know don't know if it's worth having a look at the licensing for that just to see. Yeah. Yep.. Mm. Yeah. No, you got you Yeah, you got exactly the same access to sound quality as you got from anythi anything else on the Windows. So you can you decide whatever quality you want. So got a bit of Uh yeah. Because the the synchronization, the audio and vi the audio visual synchronisation comes at a specific point in the eye track file. No, it's yeah th it's i i sta stamped into it. So it's just after just after it prints the line starting experiment uh uh yeah. I'll I'm pretty sure it's just yeah. Yep. Uh well the well the MATLAB script uh bas just sa uh just says uh yeah, gi gi gives you the times of the audio beep in the s in the signal. So I just Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Pretty confident. But you you've you've seen them. It it was it was Yeah. Yeah, I don't see him with ten he kilohertz. Yeah. Yeah, the the the there's a signal at the start and the end of every trial. So Yep. Yep. Yes, it's a stereo jack. It's a stereo jack. But it's a mono but it's a mono uh microphone. Mono mono recording on microphones. Line in. Uh sp going going through a line in. So it's a so it's a lit so it's quieter because it's not as though it's not powered. But it's still, think, yeah. We we still pick up a signal. Yeah. Yeah. Well the the when they are they are the the they have batteries in them. But i there's not doesn't. But doesn't seem to be powered because the because the line in input's so low. The so the sound the sound the s Well the yeah, the the yeah, the the the the jack that is that it's plugged into is stereo. But when you plug in when it's recording from microphone, it records in mono. And yeah. A new sound card is fixable. Yeah. Als think we we have a well I suppo I suppose it well one th one thing you do is uh re is record the sou speech signal separately for each for each person. But then you'd have to pull the two pull the two sounds together. So if uh so if i i if each machine recorded its own with a recorded the recorded like the the p th the uh the user on that one. Yeah. Yeah. Oh they yeah. And then the so the yeah. So th Yeah, it's easy. Easy. If if nothing if nothing else you h uh if nothing else you can do it in a MATLAB script. You just write read read file one, read file two. And then you just yeah. Yeah, but then the the the MATLAB the MATLAB script will tell you how l it will tell you how far apart they are. 'Cause you can do you can just measure the drift between the two of them. 'Cause you got a l you got a list of where the where the beeps are. And then you say right, this stream is like, I don't know, nought point two five seconds behind the other one. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So then They've both got the same sound card. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause 'cause 'cause Yes. Yeah. So the the external version's got plugs that size and that that is stereo microphones. But yeah. The other one's plug's like the smaller size and that isn't stereo. So the colour the colour can do it. It's just that the connectors on the the connectors at the back of the computer can't. Yeah. But as as far far as we can and find the the web site of the, yeah, the the Creative Labs web site and the review of it. Um and they weren't entirely clear. But they both suggested that it is there is a mono that there there is a mono microphone. Yeah. Yeah, I'm Yeah. So and basically out the output the G_D_F_ is just gonna be a whole series of events, you know, with start and end time. And the event's gonna have whatever all whatever the object uh is that's being looked at and things. Um and then, yeah, and then it's a matter of we're gonna put whatever filters you need after that. So you can say right, I just want so you can say from the time where they picked up triangle one to the part time it became part of the assembly, find out how it's how m percentages of time they were looking at it or whatever. Yep. So yeah. So you got mo yeah. There there's move events. There's look events. there's fixations and blinks now at the moment as well. Um and, yeah, and oh yeah and see uh looks at looks at objects and looks whatever else. So um s Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah I will.. Yep. Yep. Okay. Fair enough. Okay. Well yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. So we'll we'll get we'll get the get the audio stuff tested, you know, single microphones. Um yeah. Get that tested next couple days and I assu I assume that's not something you need me for t in terms of that.. You don't you don't need me involved in the pilot, do you. So well unle unless unless it's a bug report, yeah. I'll w yeah w I'll I'll I'll b I'll be around. But yeah, I'll make sure. But ho hopefully it will run smoothly and yeah, I can relax. So
Yeah. So this was that face to face meeting. Um but it uh it doesn't There isn't th so there are things in the eye tracker record that we definitely don't want in the G_D_F_ format, um like the frame rate eye movement. You know, we we uh uh i we're if we're expecting the G_D_F_ format to be um sort of a parsed version of events. And you know there's just too much raw frame f frame rate stuff coming out of this. You wouldn't prob you wouldn't want it in this kind of format for up-translation to the other things. Yeah, we yeah, you can get back to it. Yeah. We're not throwing anything away. This is just the stuff Yeah. Yeah. But the th but the way to think of this is this is the data that we want to be able to analyse against the other tracks of data. So the data that we wanna compare with a language or with whatever. And um so Yeah. S so in essence what you would then do is Well we're not doing frame rate at any frame for well, maybe we are. I don't know. I I had thought we were yeah, the eye tracker does. But But right. W what w um the kinds of events that we had r uh before talked about putting into the record for then use in ELAN and N_X_T_ isn't based on saying every X_ seconds something. You know, give me give me what's happening every X_ seconds. It's more like, you know, give me the fixations and the um the blinks. Yeah. Oh yeah. Durations are in there. But it's not there's a difference between um saying that something is in a particular state every frame, whatever the frame rate is, you know, ten seconds a minute. You know, that's that's one kind of w way of looking at data, and um a parsed version of the data, which isn't at um any particular length. It relies on this really close frame rate that's underneath. No, no. The time the time is still in there. But you'll get uh what you want is to figure out what are the um the concepts behind that data that you want represented. So rather than saying the eye was at this particular place, you know, here, and then a tenth of a second later here and then a tenth of a second later here. You say there was a fixation from this time to that time and there was blink from this time to that time. And Okay. Mm-hmm. Right. So there's two issues here. We're not throwing anything away. But the question is what tool would you use to get that information out of the data? Would you be so the more you can plan Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So you need to know the percentage of time it was on during that fixation. Yeah? Okay, so the percentage is i i is a cut it's not something you're using for measurement. It's a cut-off for whether or not it counts as a fixation? Is that Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Yeah. 'Cause all you wanna know is whether they were looking at the same object in the period after. Yeah. Okay. Can we draw it to make sure that that um that this is satisfying Ellen's concerns? Well, there's a white-board, right. We love this thing. See if the pens work. So um this is um A_'s eyes, right? And B_'s eyes. And I think what you're saying you should probably draw this right, is that they you know, if um from this time to this time they're looking at triangle one. W what you're saying is that you want to know in the critical you wanna know after they're they're looking at triangle one what's happening in this period with this guy, right? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So Mm-hmm. Alright. So Yeah. So, you know, he might get triangle one there and no maybe this one's gonna overlook lap quite a bit. So what you want to do is be able to define um bigger periods, which is the period when they're sort of interested in triangle one overall, right? This is sort of some meta level analysis. Yeah. But that's that's not a something that you can do in the N_X_T_ query language, but it you can't do that in any you know, this is such special purpose s but it's easy enough given the data format for any of these things to do that. So you could do it on 'cause i it's just a matter of i the hard part is deciding how close together these have to be before you decide that this is a event that you wanna pull out. Because, you know, algorithmically you're you're already putting together I mean this is essentially already, you know, these fixations with stuff in between. And uh um, you know, we we've got an algorithm for deciding when that's a look, I guess. You already have that or no? Oh yeah, yeah. So it's all fixations. They're these are all fixations and saccades, but within the yep. So that's easy enough. So the hard thing is they could be moving their eye arbitrarily here, right? And you know, maybe even having fixations on other things? Yeah? Yep. Back and forward. Yep. So um this isn't yeah. But what you need to do is we we can already build into this G_D_F_ format these regions if you can give a definition of what you think that is. But I think the right way to do this is to be able to inspect the data in um some tool and play around with the definitions. Because you won't get it right the first time. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And uh ELAN's a reasonable choice for that, right? What you need is something well no, because you need to Y you need to be able to see the effects of this. So I g I guess this is a case of Craig writing some scripts so Robin having some ideas about what the relationship is and saying, you know, add this data a automatically. It I mean it's not that hard, right. It's just there'll be a bunch of these, you'll have some rules about how maybe how long you spend on other objects and w whether the other object is um the existing construction or not, right. And so um Ah, right. So if they if they uh they had a fixation on C_ you wouldn't be worried. But if they had a fixation on Yeah, they're yep. But yeah, they're gonna look at the clock um and they're gonna look at they may look at completely irrelevant Mm-hmm. Yeah. But that's like a separate analysis, right. So It no no. The so every separate Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But what we find e what we can get out of the data easily at the moment is at this kind of level, right. And then it's a case of defining algorithmically all these other transformations that you want. So this is one uh we hadn't thought of adding before, but we should, right. Which is um well, how would you decide whether something was the current addendum uh the cu So that's a human decision. Yeah. Um But the ex But we believe But we believe J_P_ to be defining that maybe. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I could believe them, yeah, no, taking an interest in that. I mean the general division was language here and other stuff there, right. I'll just I'll just minute that. Oh yeah, eye tracker here. Yeah, I mean we know that. Well yeah. But I mean with transaction coding on something like this you would use i y you wouldn't consider it verbal analysis exactly. It'd be verbal plus action. Because it's a task breakdown. It's just a segmentation. Yeah, but you wouldn't have you you wouldn't do two codings for task level one you wouldn't do transaction coding in a action segmentation. I I don't think that's realistic, because I think what you'd actually do is use um the full record of what you have and do a segmentation. I think it'd be hard to understand what was going on if you used like just the language without watching the video to decide whether we're breaking down the task. Oh, you don't want it to be coding th uh based on that though and then that seems a strange way to go about things. I mean this the language events are multi-modal, right. You know, they're they're doing all these things together. Wha why do you care whether they can do it just based on the the language? Is Well, it seems to me much less important than the other things one could get out of this data. But I, you know, I it's a possibility. We'll Yeah, well I c I can see maybe wanting to know whether you can do the chunking just based on the actions without the language in cases where they use both. It's more g I can't quite see why it's important to know that they can do it just based on the language when w you know that they had both. Uh-huh. Well, I think that one's just bound to fail. But yeah. Really? Okay. Anyway. So back back to this main problem, which is yeah, w the record that we are getting in the first instance is about the m about these you know, they're looking at some region of the screen defined dynamically. And then we need some way of knowing what the you can you can see adding these other analyses about, you know, they're they're jointly focused on this region and trying to figure out what s percentage of time they're looking at it as adding new tiers of information to either the ELAN track or N_X_T_. They're they're both sort of track based in this way. Um but the hard part is knowing how you wanna do that. And I I think in the first instance what we're trying to get into the G_D_F_ format is just this. And then we've got no option but to uh figure out a way for like to look at this, just explore this data, suggest ways about doing it and um be able to play them back and see um when we think we've got these things right. I don't think we even know what the set of these things are that we want, much less how to get 'em yet. So th Yeah, that's right. So this is not the you know, this is something we're aiming for. But this isn't something that affects what Craig programs for the initial G_D_F_ translation. Um Yeah. So let's just return to this question of frame rate. Because this is the thing we were not planning to um transfer into this format. So again, you know, what a frame rate kind kind of coding is ag it can again be seen as a track. But it says it's a coding like this, right, where you say it's in state A_, state B_, state C_, state A_. Right. So you right. So I'm just you're happy that it's not gonna have frame rate uh like this. It's gonna have an interpretation like this. What does that mean? Sorry. Right. W right. But it seems to me it seems to me that Ellen's concerns might mean we need to add more information to these tags because um, you know, this thing in itself is th bunch of fixations, right, with saccades. Fixations and the percentage of time those fixations cover, you might want. Okay. So number of fixations. Percentage of No no. This is this is still um uh summary data. They're he's we're talking about just adding attributes to these things that say the number of fixations that counted as that looking at triangle one, right. So y it's possible Yeah, the spots'll be different anyway. 'Cause i you're not gonna g have the same pixel. So um we have the option that we can put in an A_ fixation thing here, right, as well. If you want the smaller if you want the smaller coding in in here. So that it's not just parsed into this idea of which object. But you also have the raw fixation um data. We can put that in as another track. If you think that that's something that you might want to look at in one of these tools that shows you the tracks against each other. Yeah, I d that's all he asked for. Yeah. Well, I think Yeah, and in N_X_T_ there's no cost, right, because the y the uh you just don't choose to load those. All we're doing is dumping it as output that you can load if you choose to. Um i g s you know, so if they're things that you just know are crazy and you're not gonna want then we don't do it. But otherwise we go ahead and dump 'em. 'Cause it's easy to dump out the fixations. Um yeah? Okay. So it's the number of fixations the did you want the you M not e well, if it's each, you have to d you have to break it down into another tier, right. You can't you can say there were three fixations and they averaged uh a certain time. But you don't wanna D well, what about the the overall sum of the durations? Is that I mean which way do you want to Yeah, then that's that's the way you want it? That way around? Okay. And uh y did you want the percentage of time fixated as opposed to which is sort of another view of this number. You can have as many of these as Yeah. Well, it's not um the the extra cost of having these as attributes is not high. So um, you know, it saves you i uh having to do write scripts to do arithmetic on that later if you know that these are numbers that are gonna be useful to you. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't know. Well well but y those are different tracks of information. So what you want is one track of information about which object it's one, one about whether or not it's on the other guy's gaze, and one about whether it's on um one of the mouse positions. Yeah, but i in in the analysis you should treat those as completely separate tracks of information. Because they can be looking at they could look sim simultaneously at somebody's mouse, somebody's gaze and some object, right. So Yeah. So the these are independent. So so what we want is whether they're looking at s at the other person's gaze, right, and say they are in this period well, I mean uh they're probably not given what I've trying to Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So g so there's there's a lot of tracks here, right. Because well we just added this fixation track. And then there is A_'s mouse, not their eyes, is on an object, right. And the mouse might be on triangle one. But it doesn't matter. I mean i the mouse we're just saying where is the mouse. You know, it's on this object. And then um A_'s eye is on well A_'s mouse I guess, right. A_'s eye might be looking at A_'s mouse here. A_'s eye might be looking at B_'s mouse here, right. I mean these are all the different ways of taking cross-products at the things that could be co-located. So you just treat 'em as independent. And I'm guessing from what you say yeah. I guessing from what you're saying you want all these tracks. Yeah, which is fine. There's no problem with that at all. Yeah. S so um uh you kinda got the idea here? Yeah. But the important thing is you don't treat that entire set as mutually exclusive and exhaustive. It's just so tha the objects is like a separate level of analysis. If whether they're looking at the objects than whether they're looking at the gaze. 'Cause they can happen at the same time. Does that happen? Oh, right. Uh-huh. Okay. So what you're saying is like a new problem for us, which is I'm gonna change That's the bad one. Yeah. So you're saying Okay. Can you write on my pen pad? Just say, yeah, pens. White-board pens. So you're saying, you know, they could be looking at um uh square one at this point. 'Cause they close together. Okay, that's a problem for the data models and either of the things that we were using. What do you mean by greatest overlap? Draw uh my g my uh spacial reasoning is no good. See uh I I'm the one that uses the white-board. 'Cause I actually put the the microphones on. Uh this is the better pen. Uh-huh. Yeah. But you had a way of choosing which one, right? So you just mean which i is it closer to the is the circle I mean, what is this circle? They're looking at a pixel or something, right? Right. S right. Oh, so those vary in size. Yeah yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. They could be. Oh, but what pain that's gonna be analytically. Because it's gonna how many parts are there? Like Okay. I know ways of getting around this analytically. 'Cause you c If they're really close to each other, it's gonna get foxed. Yeah. It's not the data format I'm worried about. It's the um the way you do the analysis. Because you don't wanna have to say um, you know, did they jointly look at triangle one. Okay. Did they jointly look at square one. Okay. Did they jointly look at you know, you need some way of uh uh going over the whole thing. But i c we can find ways around that. I think for now we we do it this way and then we we think about what we need out of it in the end. It's just you know, in ELAN it that has the side effect that if you go for the naturalistic way of of up-translating to ELAN, there'll be a zillion tracks. And it'll probably ruin their viewer. 'Cause you'll get very sparse data on each track. It'll be like the old referring expression generalis uh uh visualization um the map task. You know, where they talk about one object one landmark and then another landmark. Well, it's big, right. Well we'll see if ELAN likes it or not. Yeah, and we b we better also like have in the representational list of par like even in the N_X_T_ up-translation a list of parts. It it affects the way we do the N_X_T_ u up-translation and make things easier for people. Well the And it suddenly becomes and there could be more than one construct at a time, right. It's there is no the construct, right. What why does it why does construct one become construct two when you add something to it? Yeah. Oh, and this is because we don't want it to stay triangle one when you start with a construct it's not a construct at all, it's just a one thing. And we don't want triangle one to suddenly have bigger stuff. Yeah yeah, there are. There are. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That was the next question I had. Yeah. Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. That'll cover most of 'em. Mm-hmm. I yeah. It's triangle two. You don't because that's you'd have to have human coding to do that. Yeah, there might be multiple triangles that you've broke and you won't know which one they're planning on using it for. Well you know which mold they come from. And so you know which shape they match. But you can't possibly know which one of the ones they're meant to replace. Oh, so there's no two parts with the same shape? Then Oh same shape and colour. Right okay. Oh okay. So you can tell what it's meant to replace then. Because it's the same it's uh just a case of the mold, right? yep. Yeah. But the this also Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. We in when you specify these things, do you specify the molds or does it figure out what the molds are based on? So is this hard-wired into Tim's program? Or is it just an artifact of the way we s Right. Okay. So it's hard-wired. So minor modification needed for Mm-hmm. Uh but what were the req wha Has multiples, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah, uh but they don't have enough to make unique Mm-hmm. So what Yeah. Mm-hmm. So I th I think we've gotten to the point where, you know, to try to summarise, uh we we think Tim's program can do both of these conditions that you want. But I'm still worried about what the uh effects are for analysis. Because you were aiming at something in um the G_D_F_ format and I wasn't quite sure what. And w Yeah. So so okay. So I'll summarise what we said about that part that um every time you cast off a new part from a mold or, you know, every black triangle has a different I_D_. And you know it's a black triangle 'cause you know which mold it came from. But you don't know which part it was intended to replace on the screen, because you can't mind-read. What do you mean define? Mm-hmm. Mm. I think that this is a human coding that is part of the action coding. Because I don't see how anybody but a person watching this can guess why they cast off this thing at this time. Yeah, but that's okay 'cause they all have different underlying part numbers. And when you say what a construct No. No, no. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So we can easily look at things like that automatically. It's just the why they g why they get new parts that's the problem for us. We can't if they suddenly if they decide to get a part of a mold we don't know we can't know why until they do something with it, if they do. Oh yeah, you said that. Um Yeah, but you can But you can break you you can but you can break one when you break one, you don't cast off the mold yourself, it happens automatically? Oh okay, never mind then. So they just have to use it, yeah. Uh-huh. Oh, but they have to drag it up past the mold line. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, where there's extra parts. Yeah. Okay. So this why question doesn't even arise because 'Cause you know what they're gonna do with it. When they decide to move it past the mold line, they're p doing something with it probably and you'll know what they're gonna do with it because They do it. Yeah. How would you do that? Yeah, but there's there'd be no way of coding that automatically, right. How could you possibly do that? But that's a human coding, right. Mm-hmm. So w So uh that's gonna particularly be a problem for J_P_, right. Remember m all the things we're looking at are f with language with and without language. And it's gonna be very difficult to tell whether they broke something intentionally without the language. Which means it's probably not Yeah, okay. But th um this is properly part of the action coding. So we should well we should make a wish list, right, as a side effect. Mm. they could discuss deciding to break something and and then one guy does it. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. No, no. It was them just dr uh forgetting to um define an attribute they had to Well, whi which is probably a documentation fault, right. Yeah. Yeah. Is there a y yeah. Well, while we're on past things, is there anything else you wanna tell us about the prior part of this, which is the, you know, what else is he holding you up from Uh-huh. Right. So it doesn't slow down the eye tracker. It doesn't do anything nasty. So we we p so we pay for it and Nothing important and noth nothing big enough they're gonna look at it, right? Yep. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I know. Oh, do you need two copies of Camtasia to do that? So you're gonna look into this, right? Well y c look at the licence conditions, it might not I c I never pre-judge licences until I've read 'em. So uh well and um hold on, before we get go any further. So this has implications for data storage, right? Because w um it means we've got well no, this is three times, right, 'cause we've got oh no, we're gonna build we're gonna use JavaScript to build the videos on the fly, right, 'cause it's fast. So the the permanent storage is just the Camtasia stuff. So uh is that a problem? Where are we putting things? Oh we can we can put 'em in the same thing, right? You can dump 'em into one video frame if you don't mind losing resolution. But that's maybe a problem, right, because So the synchronization's gonna be a problem. Yeah, before the task. No. So These are ba these are back-ups. Right. So the flash get allows you to hand-synchronize them later if you need to by stripping extra video off the front. As long as you make sure you start 'em before the flash then you're fine. But it will there's a a cost of having to go to back-up, which is synchronizing them. Oh okay. So you so you should start the Camtasia really early then. Right. Okay. Uh-huh. That's not where you're putting it. I mean u Well okay, you've got the proper sound record. But you're not dumping it through Camtasia to record it, right. You're What before we were gonna use Camtasia at all, what well what we were gonna do what were we going to do with the sound? Uh-huh. So uh ha wou is there any sound degradation that comes about from putting this through Camtasia rather than running it out straight? Okay. So what you're planning on doing it is bunging it on one of the Camtasia tracks and then splicing it off the Camtasia track. It's an easy bit of yeah. And then you're gonna bung it on the other Camtasia track too if you need it, right? But we'll just we're gonna store all three separately then. And the sound is going to start at the same time as one of that arbitrary one of the Camtasia videos. But you'll know when the real experiment you'll know the relationship between that and the eye tracker timings? Yeah. No human intervention required. It's time-stamped. Yeah. But ho hold on. Do we need that? I mean it I I thought the way that Tim had this set up originally, um the audio uh w the time stamps used there would be joint time stamps between the audio and the eye tracker, so that, you know, uh the audio record ten seconds in was the same as ten seconds into the eye tracker record so that we didn't have to do any extra hand work, you know, any uh chopping the starts of audio signals to get there was nothing okay. So we're relying on your MATLAB script to get us the chopped version of the audio, right? Right, so we can either adjust the eye trai track data or we can actually chop the audio signal to take off the first whatever, however many seconds. Yeah, but uh but d um the uh lining up the Camtasia two is gonna take we w he's working on a MATLAB script for the sound but not for so the one that's got the sound on it, that'll also tell you where to chop the video to get it to line up. The one that doesn't have the sound on it, it won't. Oh. So it's just got the bleeps. Oh okay, so w no hand synchronization required at all. Um as long as the scripts work, right. 'Kay. How confident are you about the finding these things? So we just have to w hope we don't have an any subjects with the odd vocalizations. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. 'Cause this this is the drop-out test. Yep. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Mm. Oh yeah. I know but so you g you got a solution for that then? Oh right, okay. Yeah. You're sure there's not a better solution that involves 'Cause, you know, people might wanna use this for speech recognition or something. You never know if it's the data is there then You know. Yeah. And you're gonna want forced alignment. Oh no. Well no no. Better to collect and sort. Uh well it's the mono Wait wait, w I I thought the sol that a better solution was fixing this problem with the mono microphone socket. Sound card? So you said the problem was the m it the m m i is expecting a mono microphone input. So is that fixable? Like is there any way yeah. Uh I think a new sound card sounds a better solution than monkeying about with trying to filter white noise out. Which isn't hard. But hi but it's only got one input, right. I believe it's easy to put two monos into a stereo signal. Yeah. So Yeah, yeah. So is there any reason why we wou don't do that? Yeah. Well, it's in the old days we probably would have want a little if they'd been in the same room we would have had a little stereo thing in the background as backup as well just to make sure. 'Cause it's slightly dicier you know, if his scripts don't work then you don't get the overlap. It doesn't have to be a real trial. It just has to be two guys talking in the two bits. And then We've both been so badly bitten in the past. Yeah. But this this sounds reasonable to me. I so I think Yeah. Do do they both have the same sound card problem? I wouldn't count on it. Okay. Oh Well uh yeah. I think tell the guys. To yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's just the way they wired it. So um it's getting late and I've got a two o'clock and I've got a nice lunch. So I wanna eat my lunch today. Uh what did you wanna get through today more? I mean I think I think it was useful going through your expectations about this. 'Cause um that's quite a bit clearer in my head at least and but I think mostly we leave you to go away and re-design the G_D_F_ or add new bits to the G_D_F_ along these lines. And then w Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I think the thing to do is um for you to go away and think about it this way with the different tracks for the different objects and the um the kinds of things we've added about whether they're looking at the other person's gaze and what have you, and and try to change the spec so it it reflects this and maybe um oh maybe by that point there will be some sample data or something uh and the right thing to do is for us to look at the sp the spec the way you understand it now and some data. And then Ellen'll have new ideas about what's needed or about these post-analyses, you know, the and then and we can add 'em in. But it's gonna emerge over time. I mean that's clear. Oh, so the spec to the other conversation, yeah. Yeah, that's that's solved now. Yeah, test. We have to test. Well you don't have your models, or do you? Yeah. Yeah. Well, uh anything you actually need fixed. You know. Joe doesn't live here anymore, right? So Well, i but he wasn't gonna be booking any time to us after the thirty first of October. So um that that means that any bugs that need fixed are now Craig's responsibility, right? You don't know have any change on that, right? 'Cause he that's what he said to us originally. So I would assume, you know, no more contact with Joe. It's not fair to get work out of somebody for free. So you know, ask Craig instead. Yeah. I don't think Well w he wasn't paid in advance. He's being paid in arrears. So it doesn't matter. Uh I think it's I think it's better to have all the software. I mean it's not big things, it's just maintenance at this program at this point and Yeah. I if he can give it, you know, like because the problem is you gotta have an immediately when you discover a bug in that. And we can make Craig shift all his other priorities to do this 'cause we bought him. Right. Yeah. So it's a kinder way. It yeah. Yeah. But it sounds like you don't think there's anything that actually needs fixed at the moment. Because w we only need this to work well enough that you can use it for something and you got work rats. So And how many models do you need to completion? And how long does that take? And you got And you know about complexity? You're waiting on Marloes. You can cold call her today, this afternoon. Mm-hmm. That's her job. Come on. Oh yeah. Okay. So you can dash in there for half an hour at a time? Doesn't sound very useful for you. Uh-huh. Okay, well. You guys sort it out. Mm-hmm. Right, but it would be kind to tell her ahead of time which of your morning sessions you're bumped. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I thought that was the problem that your mornings weren't sliced off on the booking system. 'Cause you know, i if you're sa told use the booking system Yeah. And what are the instr what are the people upstairs downstairs have um i you know, as rules about who you hand the keys to. 'Cause, you know, we like people to know to ground the oh I thought the the lending for the booking system Caroline. See, 'cause you're supposed to uh have training in Oh okay, so that's the safety. And you control those accounts. Oh okay, that's fair enough. Okay. Uh-huh, yeah. That's safer. 'Cause then they learn the first time. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I really have to get out of here. So um what else is important before you run? Nothing, right? You got uh willing heads. Oh, I don't think I brought my diary up. Uh but maybe. Why? Okay. So Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. So do you know what time of day you might want? 'Cause I should c I should check that. Okay. You all have to b you'll have to be there to when it falls over. Yeah. Okay. So that all sounds f good fun. Well I can just leave you guys here, you know. Why not.
Uh five hundred Hertz though. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh m m i uh i yeah but the p sort of start and end times will give you back to that output. A as a and then you just measure it against, you know, the c the c yeah, the cumulative total time record or something. So Mm-hmm. B uh uh m yeah, so I'll I'll lag in some of it during the I suppose there's the the saccadic movement itself, for example. Th th th yeah, the it should still come out that the little sketch I asked this p for for last week about N_X_T_ and whether it would have that sort of tiered effect so you could see the overlap of where one person is looking compared to the other and their mouse movements and things. That that should ra uh address all that. Mm-hmm. But but because it's also in the i based on the the time course of the procedure you'll be able to basically get the scan path of the pattern of events from that as well. Yeah, yeah. So I did have it somewhere. I didn't have it r uh haven't brought it. trying to remember it. Mm-hmm. The Uh it m it m uh but uh br at that point they're all of it lumped all the individual fixations as long as it doesn't move off that triangle together as a total sort of gaze gaze time on that. Yep. Yeah. That that's a target within the target region. Uh m Uh-huh. M yes, somewhere. Mm-hmm. It it sh yeah, it I mean uh as long as we're dif r yeah, it there shouldn't be anything missing. That should be alright... Yeah. Yep. M m yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yes. So we yeah. So we if we have an an event, yeah, that that yeah, the second line then for the second before it. And then we can just take that chunk out and do something with it. That should I I Right. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Uh well, if it's just based on uh like a a stable fixation for so long or or something and crossing into that region. Yeah. yep. Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, yeah. To mm-hmm. Don't know. Mm-hmm. More. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well he's really interested in Mm-hmm. So which one does Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's what I have understood it to be. But well I don't know. But W uh mm-hmm mm-hmm. Yes, uh-huh, yeah. It's mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You can we can announce now. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well Uh but y y y You mean to the tags of the data w within it. Yeah. So so things like fixation, the number of fixations a and Bi um yeah, with some some measure of the so we could work out the number of fixations that made and the average fixation duration as well. Because having st long steady fixations can be informative. Um if if they're holding their if there's less dancing around, the um the cognitive focus tends to be in one sort of part. So uh there is a difference between if they even though they're still looking at the same part, if they're looking around it uh rather than just holding their gaze steady or um and longer on it. Uh yeah. It, yeah, it's it's certainly it's it's worth mm-hmm. Uh no, I wouldn't want to throw out Put the actual location Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I mean presumably Uh if well yes, but that probably isn't going to be easy to get out because you'd then have to break up uh the parts somehow. Yep. Mm-hmm. Uh it it yes, it can do, but it's also looking at it within their their own behaviour to see, yeah. Uh th w I I would say just the number of fixations. I mean it could just be yeah, the number of different yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Exactly. So Mm-hmm. I mean to It yeah. Uh if if we've got everything, then I suppose it's you can always yes, it's you're not throwing anything away then. Or Right. Mm-hmm. Uh but uh uh number uh well the uh duration time as well somehow. Whether it's the average one or Of the fixation. Well The the average should be alright uh to work with. The the Uh well, if you've got the number of fixations in the average time, you can then just generate it. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh Again, uh that that should be you should be able to derive that presumably from Right. Uh that it can vary a bit depending on the calibration. But if we're building in a sort of error margin um it it will be based on pixels around. But there'll also be a minimum one. 'Cause I'm trying to think that it's probably the small the actual mouse icon is so small, it'll need a slightly larger uh just because if what you have i is a sort of larger error or of b error margin around it. Uh no. The o the other person's gaze position as well. Mm-hmm. Yep. Trea treated the same as as the mouse say. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yes, yep. Yes. So if there uh if mm-hmm. Yes. But not looking at their individual and pr fact, they probably will avoid looking directly. Because if they're looking directly at it, it's obscuring the the part. Mm-hmm. Yeah, mm-hmm. The Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The m the mouse, the gaze and the part are all layered. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh uh if when they get moved together. Mm-hmm. It Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Two objects close together, your eye gaze can actually be looking at the left edge of one and the right edge of the other. And they're sor therefore looking at two objects at once. Saying they need some new pens. New pens. White-board pens. Mm-hmm. Uh unle uh but it uh unless we just define it as there's only they're they are exclusive. And which ever area m has the greatest overlap is what they're actually looking at. Well it w if if you've got your sort of eye position, and it's it's unlikely to be exactly fifty percent in one object and fifty percent in the other. Uh Well I uh uh put these things on. Yeah. Uh uh what I'm I'm thinking is if you've got say one object there and right. You know, so this is thank you. Uh part one and part two. And you've got they're sort of they're looking there. Then that overlap means they're looking at the two pieces simultaneously. But Yeah, uh just if this is there's more of it uh yeah, I yes, uh that's w uh that's that's a decision we'll uh uh uh I'm saying is if they're looking if most of what their overlap is here then we stick with that one. Uh that's th we no, that because um the gaze position will be a sort of fuzzy area. It won't just be a pixel. It'll it'll be an actual like circle and area. Yeah. So i i it it that's that's going to be w uh it's it's not just a single point. It's it's a it's a sort of lump target. And so there'll be a bit of a a sort uh some sort of overlap of two objects. Or b yeah, they could just be oscillating mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh I mean if if they are oscillating though, then that's presumably going to st change the weight. So you are actually going to see them flipping between uh when you decide they're looking there mm-hmm, if they're really close, yeah. Mm-hmm. H yes. Hmm. The yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh i it's also going to be a problem uh because you're going to have one part or a construct forming in the middle of a fixation. So it's not gonna be quite as clear if you can't can't chop it off. Uh-huh. And then it yes. And it becomes construct or assembly whatever two. No. You can build sub sub-assemblies and then link the the part really, yeah. I so each Wai w I th uh Which constituent parts. Construct. You'll be looking at the construct. 'Cause that's the way it's dis defined. Looking at areas within it. Hmm. Uh w They can't replace uh the new parts only appear when the previous one's broken. Yes. They ca they can appear without them. You c Uh with same shape but not the same shape and colour. Uh same eye. Yeah. Yep. Well that's well that's that's what they're at the moment. Uh Yes. So that's the way it works at the moment. Uh I just assume that's how ni Nijmegen had set it all up. Th that's that's back to uh Tim's day. They are individual uh you have different colours for the yep. Unique, yeah. Yes. The tam tamgrams are much easier when you can see Mm-hmm. Yep. It is just a construction task rather than a puzzle. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh yes. It at the moment there are d uh there are two I think two small ones and two large triangles. They're actually the same physical size and shape. At the moment they're in different colours. That also means in the p new parts list they're there for, you know, two v large triangles and two small one small ones, say. Whereas in in the revised edition if they were all just black there'd only be one uh mold in the new parts. As far as I know it's hard-wired. It just appears so. Mm-hmm. The polygon one, polygon two, whatever it might be. Mm mm-hmm. Yep. Hmm. Yep, same same pieces. Mm-hmm. No, so they they can have different uh nuts there. W well nuts that are different colours. But same part in different colours, yeah. No, what I mean there's more than they're multiple pieces that look the same. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And the extra parts don't appear. So you can't collect them. Yeah. There there are a couple of them that it's like greyed out. They really very faint. So you see the mold is there. But they don't come filled uh until Yes. Yes. I i it appears in the new p uh like uh suddenly the th th the new part lights up sort of thing and it's there. Yes. They have to bring it into play. No. Nope. That yeah. That that is one think unlike the say the Baufix or anything. We I assume the the Baufix. The there aren't any extra parts. And at the moment the software doesn't a allow for that. Yes. Replacement, but no superfluous so you can't have a a standard stock with extra parts that it'll never use. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Intentional um in the sense that they break deliberately when they bring them into the new parts. But they c you know, it's like the trash can idea that they bring a You have to hope that there's language and one of them says something. You c mm-hmm. Uh there's no there's there's no way you could tell that just from the the raw movements or or something. Mm yep. Yeah. It I Although What I'm trying to remember is if the people deliberately break things by moving two pieces together. They they don't both break. They both they both Mm-hmm. So the i intentional thing is when they actually both click on the same object and it breaks. No, they could just make a mistake or screw up, yeah. Y yeah. But that's bringing in the the language thing again. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh uh yes. At the the percentage score. Yeah. So our yes, rather than the number of penalties or or something. No, the the score w uh is fine. Uh ye that's that's the way it's worked out. But uh uh the problem was um to do with the m the p they had a relative and absolute piece and uh it's all to s to the symmetry of that. So as long as it's defined, fine. Yes. It wasn't it wasn't a bug. It it it was a Uh well. Uh yes, it was something that had to be defined and the uh Dutch lot didn't. So that was it was actually their their fault. But um it's not clear enough in the documentation. Yeah. Yeah. But i it it is quite fundamental and uh causes quite immediate problems if you don't know about it. Yep, exactly. Yeah. Or oh we're well we yeah. we should should go back to the beginning. The um Camtasia was tested last week and initially we were a bit worried because uh in the old version it seemed to interfere with it. But uh when you when Craig re-compiled it and did his new version it started wor wor it seems to work fine. Um Nothing we can tell. No uh Mm-hmm. No. Yes. There will now have to be two Camtasia records because uh e each person actually sees a different screen because of the gaze feedback. They don't see their own gaze to the other person. So there'll need to be two separate Camtasia videos generated. Hopefully we won't. You mean officially? Or uh Yeah, I hadn't thought about the I was assuming we'd just get one and one licence both of us. Suppose technically we should have two because it'll be two machines. I suspect that it will. It'll be per machine I would think. Hmm. I I'll have a uh yeah, I'll have a l a look at the actual Camtasia licence. Um the other thing we're we It 'cause it's now twice twice the size of a Uh mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well the other problem is uh Camtasia has to be manually launched on both machines separately. Yeah. Uh during the task there is a flash and a bleep. Oh I mean not during the task. Uh before. For each task. Yes. Yes. Uh Camtasia y yeah. But No, they're they're on two s the two separate machines and the you you start and end them separately. The they they're not talking to each other. They're just recording. You start it recording and it starts recording what's on one screen. And you start the other recording on the other machine. And they're they're totally separate. They don't know about the other one. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yes. Uh yeah. See how how long it took them actually. That's that's true. How long did it take them to calibrate. Or yeah. How many t how many times before uh the validation worked or something. Yeah, that's true. I uh Well it at the moment the that's what I was assuming on on on doing that uh it's done first. Mm-hmm. You go back and actually yes, they were crap. Isn't that the answer? Yeah. Um yes. The other thing we were getting sorted out was the the microphones. 'Cause only one of the uh Camtasia videos will actually have the soundtrack. Uh we're just getting we've got one cable and to the two mics. I suppose we can do it is it would it be worth splitting it? Uh yeah. So the at at at the moment it's ins well, what we've finally just uh at twelve o'clock today looks like we've got it sussed um is to get one channel one microphone being the left channel and one being the right channel to merge into a stereo single file. Uh unfortunately the on one machine. The display P_C_s. Yeah, the Camtasia v video. Or m m multi-media thing. Yeah. Yes. It it's Yep. It's Camtasia that's recording it.
Which data. You know, I I want everything and then I'll decide what I want. Okay. We can get back to it. We can get we can always get back to it. We're not th actually throwing anything away. And if we decide to re-jig this at some finer Mecha method. We'll still have the original and a method of uh of filtering. So Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. As long as the format in which we pick it up is a format which could be generalised to a finer take. Because the worst thing that can ever happen to you is you discover that you've done huge amounts of analysis and th you actually had the data but you threw it away because you treated it so grossly. Okay. So whatever we should be able to b you know, backtrack and say okay instead of every second, every tenth of a second or some such thing. But you know th Well, the eye tracker does. Mm-hmm. Well, you need Well one needs to know the duration of these things, right. So one needs to be able to say Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well so there's no real time, there's only ev there's only events. What I'm we're trying to figure out is whether we've thrown time away. Here Okay, so one of the formats in which eye tracker data is analysed is percentage of time spent on some target as opposed to some competitor over the first second after some event, okay. So you actually have to be shu have to show at some time slice rate whether the eye was on the same target as the other guy, a similar target, what we'd both been deali you know. So we have to b we have all the parts, the interesting parts of the screen identified and be able to show distribution of gaze over time. Alright. Now we could be really unlucky and somebody would expect us to do that at the real frame rate. But I think that's really unlucky. But but my point is that we mustn't throw away in or lose the capacity of being able to deliver that kind of data. Mm-hmm. Mm. S so typically the eye will move, right. So over any one second, they eye's actually f fixing on a bunch of different things. And you and so when you say the eye was on this from here to here what's gonna happen is that is that if you use the real frame rate, it's gonna jiggle all over the place. It's gonna be on this landmark. Uh it's on this object, that object, this fixed thing, that fixed thing, okay. You're gonna get lots and lots of stuff. And it's percentage distribution that you're going to want. It's not uh I went here. I s you know, it's not like person walking. I went here, I stayed here. It's it's more like a fly hovering. Mm-hmm. Because if you if you take them as separate events you get thousands of separate events. Mm-hmm. Against bigger frames. Well, that's the that's the problem. There are two ways of doing it. One is that there's always a cut-off, right. But the other is that there will be a time span, a kind of reaction to some event span. Right. Right. And so I mean there are there are really two ways of looking at this. One would like to know for example the percentage of time overall in which two people are looking at the same thing, okay. And one would like to know sequences of they didn't look at the same thing and then they broke it. Or they did look at the same thing and then they did or didn't brea you know. One one could imagine those two categories. That's that's a kind of testing of our hypotheses. But there's a certain amount of um dues you pay to the way they do things in the literature to get your papers published. And one of the things they will want to know is an event series after some critical event, right. What percentage of time is given to looking where the other guy is looking. And what percentage of time over some, you know, reasonable time span of a couple of seconds, alright. So they'll be they they'll want to see essentially the gaze settling on particular incidents on particular places. So we have to be able to deliver those two things and they're rather different demands. Right. Or how l alright. Let's let's imagine a typical construction event, okay. There is some part there are there are separate movable parts on the screen ready for use, right. There may be or not a construction already begun, right. Somebody makes the first move. There's some kind of communication either gestural, imaginary or verbal, that plans how we're gonna do it, right. Before that happens the person who speaks is going to do some kind of visual scanning. While they're speaking or communicating in some way, the other person may or may not be looking where they're looking, okay. They may be overlapping gaze at particular objects which are of interest. Let's call it the c the construct, existing construct, which could be zero. Alright. Or the um the addendum, the thing which is next going to be added. Next piece, okay. Now in neither case, when you draw this, he's looking at triangle one, which you're actually drawing, you know, for a the period of time in which he's steadily looking at triangle one is gonna be very very short, right. Because staring fixedly without interruption, blink or or saccade is is an extremely short event. That's fine. So it's in a region it's in a region. Okay. But even so you're likely to get bouncing in and out of the region, right. So even so you wanna look at if we're interested in how long before the construction move takes place, um how much of the time they spend looking at the same thing. Let's call that our measure of alignment. So they're gonna be yeah, that's right, A_ is gonna be on triangle one and various other places. That's right. And and B_ um okay. And we're gonna look at the percentage of of that time where they're both in the same region. Right. So what I want to make sure is that we don't um simplify, do you know what I mean? Temporarily simplify too much, so that yeah. 'Cause then you lose percentage as an as a as a D_V_. Right. And so B_ has some periods of looking at one and all it will which will also be intermittent. Because Right. Mm-hmm. When they should be. Right. Okay. Mm-hmm. Well It Right. What Yes. Yes, because for example for part of that time both B_ and A_ are probably looking at the construct, okay. If if your intention is to move the red triangle to sit on top of the thing already constructed, you would tend to look back and forth. Right. And we should be able to to figure that out. Yeah, sure. So so the question would be under what tool should we be looking at these events. So Right. So so essentially there's there's um A_E_ is divided into T_R_ one and C_ and other stuff, okay, where C_ is the construct, the existing thing. Well no. I mean we'd take a separate we'd look at the percentage time I mean I have no idea because I don't know how people look when they're building things together, okay. So there's a there's the addendum and the and the co the existing construct. And I don't know whether they're gonna spend more time looking at one or the other. But if they're whatever it is that one is looking at, if the other's looking the same place they're in good shape. Yeah. Sure, sure. And that's what the other stuff that's what the that's what the diagonal stripes are for. That's true. But we c we can one of the things we'll be doing is um categorising people I take it or interactions by the amount of time people spend looking at the clock. We'd expect that if we put people under time pressure they'll look at the clock a lot more. Sure, it's a separate analysis. But you don't wanna throw it away, right. So so you can define if all of these things are actually categorised by the eye tracker as to where the eye is, alright, you should be able to pull out any interesting category and say alright for this phase it's T_R_ one, or C_. For this phase it's um S_Q_ one or C_, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You have to actually transcribe the thing or watch the film further on. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah, that's the addendum in the construct should be, you know, kind of they they change their true identity. But they're i their categories of stuff now I w my kind of assumption was that that this was J_P_ land, that that's what he was re what he was really interested in was the kind of coding which would define the building sequence, okay? So and the and maybe he wants to think about that more and say well there were several candidates for the addendum, alright. And and it was the negotiation of which candidate was gonna be the right candidate that's actually the interesting stuff. So I should talk to him about this. He's he's actually um emailed me with a l with a list of things he wants to discuss at length. So I w I'll bring this one back to him. Well this is my question for him. Is he gonna define this kind of building sequence in a way that we can get out. Or is he so b I mean, you know, they've been working on construction there for a while. So it may be that they have a coding system that's ready to go and we should just apply it. Okay. Um they do a lot of sub-assembly in the tasks they've been doing. So they may well have a yeah. Let's find out. Right. Right. So wha right. What well we but we have the now actions I mean actions might mostly be theirs, right. But since we have the the eye tracker i th we're gonna have to answer their questions about gaze, right. Yeah, I right. But um so they'll they'll uh they'll tell us something about that. But um presumably what you piously hope is happens here is what happened with um transactions, right, that the verbal analysis and the um and the visual analysis give you the same breaking points, the same chunking points. Well, I mean what you know. It's it is it is a task breakdown. But for the verbal version there are ways of announcing that now we're doing a new one, right. Or that we're finished with the old one. No, you wouldn't. But I mean one of the things one of the things you'd like to establish you know, as an as an outcome of this is that you could analyse either end and you'd get the same chunking of the material. The thing which you guys thought to make in a paper. It's a hypothesis. Well They are doing these things together. But one of the things that you one could imagine doing is um sen is, you know, having the transcription there and pl just play it back to a bunch of captive undergraduates and say when do they stop and start Um because because essentially you're looking at um cycling sequences in discourse. And if the discourse tells you what's going on that's information. I mean I g one of the questions is how the information is gonna be shared across these media. And if you can get it all out of the speech, you know, if the if all of the chunking is available when there is speech, okay, then it's carrying a lot of the burden. It's saying we are done with that and Mm. But this is but we haven't looked at data like this with this with our old-fashioned analyses um, you know. And i it's it would be really nice to know that that much information, that chunking of the task information is being carried by the language. Because J_P_'s question, the overriding question is so what's language for. You know, if people are busy interacting all the time and all of our colleagues don't even bother to control for whether people are talking to one another when they're doing these joint tasks because it seems to them to be irrelevant 'cause language is irrelevant, it would actually be nice to demonstrate that in a place where we're controlling whether you have language or not. You could get the entire chunking of the task out of a language. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Because you know it's a self-contained system as opposed to a system which is which can't be interpreted without the other system. Okay. Usually the claim. Almost all studies on language claim that language is a self-contained system which will give you everything you need to know. That's the claim. Alright. I didn't say it was true. I said that's the claim. And so it's worth testing. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No no. And we won't and establishing the full set will, you know, take us much of the project. So you know Fine. My only concern w uh you a as I said when I barged in was just to make sure that we didn't lose the things that we might need to pick up later. That's all. Every single frame. Well Okay. But since the l the definitions of look a thing we're looking at are d um are the ones which get rid of the lower level. Like jiggling around in the area of a particular object, right. So if we're moving the the green triangle um we've defined a region which is the dynamically the green triangle, wherever it is. We will jiggle around in there. But it doesn't matter where we are in there. That's beneath our level of analysis. S Well the in that interpretation is definable to frame rate by our by the only way we're gonna use frame rate. I c well, I mean i because I can I can say for how many frames this fixation went is officially defined. So that as long as I as long as it's not a untimed event, okay. A and an end time. So it's, you know, it's fine. I can say it's a long one. Or it's a short one. Or it's, you know, it's twenty milliseconds more than that one. That's Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And okay, I'm I'm asking you as an expert. This is this this isn't a leading question. This is a question question. Why would that be informative particularly? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. On it. So you think that if for example if they're looking at um one or another um apex of a triangle it would just that would make a difference. They were exploring the thing, as opposed to they were simply alright, there is it there it is. Okay, so th um so that really means that we're not throwing away absolute fixations. The screen location of absolute fixations. Alright. Uh-huh. As opposed to out of it. So you so I thought I understood you to mean exploring the figure. Because you know, your fixation is a point. And the figures are bigger than points. So you could be exploring the figure or you could be just somewhere in the region defined as the figure but not on it. Okay. Alright, fine. The So you just want to know the variability of the of the fixation. And wouldn't that differ from person to person? Okay. So it's the number of different spots within that region where the eye has fixed the number of different fix oh, ok okay. So it's a jiggle rate, okay. Right. Mm-hmm. Well, all I th understood you to ask for was the duration of each fixation inside. Yeah. You can come back. Okay. Right. So it's the number of different fixations. Well, actually do you want the average duration? Or do you want the number of different ones? Duration of each fixation in the region. Well, you've already got that. So that's a measure of jiggle in the region, roughly. Moving. Okay. What's our error of measurement on location on the screen? So to what degree do we actually know whether the two little eyes, little circles, are exactly in the same place or just somewhere in the same region? Right, okay. Right. Mm-hmm. It's yeah, okay, right. S Okay. So my question was going to be alright, the the mouse is a dynamic object, right. The eye track is a dynamic object? Or is it only the the piece that the eye tra the other person's eye track is on that's that's an object in this definition? Is a is an object. Okay. With some with plus or minus something or other, yeah, around it. Some circular area. Okay. And Um so you can be on the object but not on the other person's gaze. So there can be a triangle which has A_'s gaze in the centre and your gaze actually happens to be here. You're in the triangle region. Does this Okay. But it's directly added when when these two in this situation when these two overlap, right, like this. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well it would come up it would say yes, right? I mean because they would be in the same place. So if you y you're gonna have dynamic regions which overlap one another by definition. If the mouse is on the construct, then right, right. Right. We treat those as as other objects. But the difference between them and the the parts of the c thing to be constructed is that they're allowed to overlap with other things so nothing breaks. Okay? If we mm-hmm. Ye Mm-hmm. Yes, as opposed to simply looking at somebody's gaze when the mouse isn't also there, right. And you want to know those things. Right, they're i they're independent dynamic objects. Okay. So a definition of we're all looking at and touching the same thing. So imagine that we've just added a piece to the construct, alright. So now that's the construct. And both mouse symbols are on it, right. And both gazes are on it, right. So at that point you should have a line-up of A_ is on the construct, A_ is on the mouse, A_ is on A_ is on A_'s mouse, A_ is on B_'s mouse, A_ is on B_'s gaze, and B_ likewise. Okay. Right. Ooh, I love the eraser. Mm-hmm. Yeah, but the mouse is also a dynamic object. That's fine. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Right. And then you then you look for combinations of them. Yeah. I think we need to. Because tha some measure of alignment is looking where the other guy is directing attention. And there are two measures of where the other guy is directing attention that you get from the visual track. One is where the mouse is and the other is where the gaze is. So Mm-hmm. Right. Right. So Yeah, that actually true. Be 'cause Right, but that it's also gonna be the case that um whatever region you define as the region of the dynamic object of the red triangle may get to the point where it overlaps the region of the dynamic object of the green square. Okay, what do we do about that? Yeah, because if you have them close together, there's always some fuzz factor around them. And so if they're left lying close together, okay, or in the in fact in the model, in the not in the model, in the in the supplies set they're actually neatly packed into a little space. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Squeak squeak. Yes. Because the two are so close together that their regions overlap. Mm-hmm. The greatest overlap with what? Ho ho. I think I think you're throwing information away. Yeah. But it may be a bad idea. It may be a bad idea. You've just thrown data away. Yeah. J Well The gaze will wobble. The gaze will wobble. That's natural. Mm-hmm. Or indeed they might be looking from one to another. D or deciding which one to choose or thinking so you don't want to decide it's only one and throw the other one out. Mm-hmm. Okay, well that's fine. That I was going to say that's the obvious way to do it. Well each one is yes or no. couple of dozen. Right. Six to a dozen usually. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean I think it's very likely that um if people are considering f mm-hmm. Well, not if the regions overlap, okay. If the regions i Right. And if you define the regions so neatly that there's that, you know, that we're losing gaze because of jiggle outside this closely defined region when it's in the middle of space, then I mean I I actually like the solution, however ugly it it looks in terms of a data format of having a track for every possible object of gaze. Mm-hmm. S a thing. Mm-hmm. Well okay. So Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I always thought that was brilliant. Yeah, it is big, and you do have to scroll through it to see what's going on. But it gives you a very clear picture of what's going on. Yeah, well, okay. But so we'd we'd better do a test one and and listen to them scream. With parts. Right. So I mean so Mm-hmm. Okay. So what about the point where a part becomes the construct? Do you still identify it as a part? I mean I think one should lose that I take it. 'Cause Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. So you cha so every time a part is added to the construct, it becomes a new part. So the construct actually um has say it has six things that are added to some initial thing, okay. So if there's just the initial thing you've put it in the middle of the screen, that's just the initial object, right. Soon as you put a part, there's a construct. But it's construct one. Because when you add another part, construct one ceases to exist and you get construct two, right. So actually defining all of those as the construct is gonna be the trickiest thing. Right. So you're you're looking at triangle one, right, and all of a sudden it ceases to exist. 'Cause you can build sub-assemblies. And then you can start again. Also when you when you screw it up, you g start again. Because the definition Mm-hmm. Well, the problem is that all of these things are popping out of existence. So do we know the difference between um we broke it and it went away and um it's now part of the construct? Can we ta can we tag the constructs with what's in them? Yeah. Okay. So we could we could essentially well, then we could cumulati or it is a new construct 'cause it has a new list of a new cumulative list of parts, right. But we will Right. So So some fancy programming's gonna have to be done to say I was looking at triangle one and now I'm looking at triangle one in construct one. 'Cause the first construct was triangle one and square one, okay. Alright. So now we have to ask whether um So l let's imagine this, we've made a construct of two parts, and we're c i a triangle and a square. And we're considering now adding something on to the side of the square that isn't attached to the triangle. Okay. Are we looking at the square or we looking at the construct? Yeah. Uh in this definit should be looking at the construct. There isn't a way to figure out that you're looking at the square rather than the triangle. Mm-hmm. It is. Well Okay, because I mean that's that's the example m f presumably that's the best example of overlapping overlapping areas. 'Cause if if the thing the two s the two things are now abutted. Of course there's an area which is common to both of them, okay. Um so what I'm trying to run through in my head is that we can always tell the difference between um something going out of existence 'cause it's joined to construct something going out of existence 'cause we threw it away, right. Suppose we pick up an we we we screwed up the first time we put the triangle with the square and we threw it away and decided we didn't like it, and we took another one. Is it triangle one? Is it triangle one prime or something like that? It's the replacement for triangle one. Mm-hmm. Well how do I know what it replaces? N n Uh this is true. But if I have triangles one two three, right, and I throw them away, any triangles I take out are to replace one two three. Okay. Except that ex no, you don't know which one they're meant to replace. But you know they're not meant to replace any that are all that are that haven't been thrown away. Okay. Right. So the new parts are replacing those which have disappeared from the screen. And if there's no more T_R_ one track the T_R_ one track is gone now. Oh there are many. Same identity. Oh, is that true? You've decided not to make all the triangles red and squares green and Oh, okay. Right. One two and three. they Okay. So So there So shape plus colour. Okay. They're unique. All the parts are unique. So wai hang on. That makes the task a little bit easier, right. The uh all the lines. So Indeed. Which kind of leaves you with an obvious way of making the same task harder and easier, doesn't it? But but that's hard to code. I mean that's really a thing we might do. Okay. So now let's make sure that the coding would survive that. It's just it's a beautifully controlled situation. The construction task is essentially the same. It's the figuring out stuff that gets harder if everything is purple. For a just to choose a colour at random here. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So if you have five black triangles, there gonna be five black triangles in the parts box? Or one? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. As long as it this is possible. So c that that just is a kind of thing which is so simple, so much like a single one zero variable change that it if it that doesn't already exist. 'Cause I'm tr I'm trying to kinda map this onto Baufix. Um and Baufix has has multiple, you know, all the the The the v the nuts are are red or and all the um flat things are wood colour something. The same part the same part is different colours. Oh yeah? So when you say a red nut or a green bolt or a long green bolt then there'll be lots of them lying around. And I think that's how the robot is set up to there are five five green bolts. Uh here is one, you know. Okay. Okay. So Okay, so w uh all I'm I'm doing is kind of worrying out loud about all the things that will happen that we'll miss by th a simple view of for example regions and looking at at triangle one. When is triangle one not triangle one anymore. Um does it s keep its identity. Mm. Identity, yes. Mm-hmm. That's true. So how can we define the shapes that people build? Well If assuming I was for a moment I was J_P_ and I wanted to know how they actually went about building the thing. Okay. And I wanted to um to look at the strategy. And I wanted to see if the strategy was different when we could talk about it and when we just picked up whatever. I mean suppose I can't talk to you and I'm doing this task with you and I can't talk to you. Um the thing which is gonna be hardest for me is making elaborate plans with you. I can reach for the next thing and you can go where I reach. But if I have some, you know, sub-goal, some long-term sub-goal, of doing something clever with putting these together 'cause it's hard and then putting these together 'cause it's hard, there it's gonna be almost impossible to convey that to you. And the difference in the history of construction, right, is an important thing, and I wonder how we can get that information back. Do you think? No, it why is not uh that's that's not the question I'm asking. The question I'm asking is what's the history of the construct? So you have the n the names of the things in there. And you have two constructs suppose we have two sub-constructs. And whichever one had two pieces put together first is the earlier numbered of those constructs, right. How do you tell the difference between adding a piece to this first construct and creating a second construct? Mm. Okay. It's it's it's parent child relationship. Okay. So construct two could b um construct one is um a red triangle and a green square. Construct two is um two green squares, okay. Construct three, right, is a red triangle, a green square and another red triangle. Construct four okay. Okay. And you can so how are we gonna tell when for example you think we're gonna have to do human coding on when two sub-constructs are put together. No, that's a definition wherein a construct has a c has constructs as children? Okay. Okay. Right. So we could zip we could zip through this and look at all the um all the interactions in which people build sub-construct contstructs first which we expect them to do bu as a wild hypothesis more when they have verbal communication than when they don't, okay. And we can do that by simply searching for any constructs that have constructs as children. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, we haven't actually made a rule that you can't uh collect extra parts, right? No no. I mean you have to b you have to break one to get one, okay. And you can't just bring extras in case you screw up. You have to screw up first and then you can bring an extra. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. I but it does have replacement. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. There there's a so you so so you appreciate you appreciate the cost of screwing up. Mm-hmm.. Mm-hmm, that's right. Right. Okay. So they rejected something or they broke something inadvertantly. Okay. Is there a way of telling the difference between intentional and unintentional breakages? Bec yeah. No, you p they both put they both put their hands on a construct because they don't like it.. Mm-hmm. Yep. So that just has to be coded. Mm-hmm. Um not generically. Because they'll if they're gonna do it by gesture they'll build up a convention, right. What else do we need to know? Unless they develop a convention. Suppose they start off with language and then they they say hey look, you know, let's do it like this. Sure. Absolutely. I just I just wanna make sure that a wish list, yes. Yes. For sure you know that's and l or well n is not necessarily intentional. They could just screw up. Yep. Mm-hmm. Or I don't think that's very good, no, we'll never get away with that, we'll get a bad score. Let's just throw that away and start again, yeah. Okay. Which reminds we have fixed the score problem. Have we? Right. Was the percentage overlap and that made the score? Yeah? That's when I left. Oh yeah, well do you know which which which which one was the top right. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But that's all been fixed. That's that's that's back. Don't tell me it was a feature. Alright. Oh okay. Oh. So Hmm. But The right. Not prominently flagged. Okay. A communication flaw. Okay. So we can now that's now just lovely. And there won't be any crazy scores anymore. Oh. I have to use a new page. Alright. So the last I think I'm sorry, you know, I had as assorted emails from you and I was probably didn't catch everything. The problem was that there are two Camtasia records. They don't see their own gaze. They see the o only the other guy's gaze, right. Huh huh. Okay. I mean Check out Okay. So we Mm-hmm. Is there mm. Is there such a thing um as um, you know, dual track video? Because you can certainly mix things. Um what ideally one wants one doesn't really want to l to have these things. Uh um because we're using them for back-up and for coding. We don't really want to play them independently. We do almost always want to use them in exactly in parallel. Time aligned. Um what are we doing for synchronization otherwise? Okay. So that we'd have to re-align them. We couldn't dump them from their start points. Well, maybe you could. The thing that you're dumping them onto just starts running with the flash and the bleep. You turn on the two copies whenever at different times. But they're still no? Is the what what i th what are they I don't really understand the the parts that are operating here. Two videos are turning on. There is no time stamp that comes from some common source. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Okay. Right, is there a div mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So they'll include things like the um the eye tracker calibration, right, which is not a bad thing actually. Because sometimes you wanna go back and find out if this was just a particularly duff subject.. Right. Yeah. And hand every time we re-calibrated the damn thing slipped, yeah. That actually helps. I mean that ni Right. Yep. Mm-hmm. Right. No, they that actually saves you hours trying to make somebody's data smooth out when it won't. Because yeah. That's a technical term. That's a a technical categorization in psychological research. And that's because? Well we need sound we we need real sound recording, right. That's that's two track. That's stereo. Alright. Uh-huh. On w on what? Uh sorry. Uh On one of the Con O o it's uh On Camtasia. That's our only sound record? Mm. Mm-hmm. How good is it? Yeah. Have to really question. Mm-hmm. And then then they can do sound analysis on that. Oh okay. Right. So we there's gonna be a way to, sooner or later, to align the eye track, Camtasia one, Camtasia two with two sound channels. Right. Mm-hmm. Ah, the bleep we'll find. Mm. Right. Right. Right. They uh they also tend to have a funny funny shape, beeps. So Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, is there an end signal? When you decide it's all over, does it ping you back and Right. Okay. So when you've when you've pressed we're finished, it pings back at you? Okay. It's just that all kinds of crazy things happen when you're running things, and so up saving a percentage of a trial is sometimes a good i you know, being able to do that is sometimes a good idea. Okay. Can w Yeah, can we do can we do something better than that? Like having Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's it's crazy. We're in an anechoic room which we specially, yeah, built an anechoic. But, you know, sound room which we specially built for this. We're d in good circumstances. We shouldn't screw it up more than we have to. Is there anything we can do to improve this? No. No, no. Do you have a powered microphone or something. Right. That the line is stereo, the input is mono. Right? Is that what you said? Right. Is ah. That's somewhere in the sound card. Yep. Its own track, its own video. You have to align the videos anyway, right? I Well I'm not the technical person who would do it. But I know who to ask. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But it's the same as Mm-hmm. Says Robin thinking about cutting and splicing, yeah. Yeah, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I wanna see several of them. I wanna see I wanna see one of them um look really nice before we start running subjects. Can we do that? Yeah. Yes, that's right. I just wanna know it works the way you expect it to work. This is not a a gesture of mistrust. This is just experience that um if anything can screw up it will. I I'm trying to choose my language carefully because we're being recorded. But you'll hear more choice language at the point when we've all done a lot of work and and then we discover we can't use the session because of some thing we didn't think about. Right. Um Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. And then then we combine Yeah. It's probably worth mentioning this to the to the guys in the garage in Toronto, right. To say mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Right. I think that's a if the documentation said it w could record in stereo then I think we should talk to them about how they've done this. Is you're not sure from the documentation what it says it can do? Mm-hmm. Right. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right. Right. Okay. Right. Right. Right. Okay, so when you I mean uh given that there are these events recorded, we can use any of them as the beginning of any of them as a start point, for example, right. Um there are also motions being recorded of objects. Right. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay.. Right. Yeah. So I'm right. Uh that that that's great. I I'd before we break up for lunch I just wanna make sure that tha that I know how long it's gonna be before we're in run mode, okay. So the sound thing the sound thing is stands in our way, we need to be recording sound online. Okay. So that's a thing that has to be solved. The shape thing is solved. Mm-hmm. We think. We believe. Right. So that's that that that should be done this week. Um in fact like tomorrow for example. Um the shape all the shape problems are solved. Generating shapes, no problem. Um scoring shape overlap, no problem. Nothing is problem there. There are no visual display problems. Mm-hmm. Yeah, they had their They had their inspection last week. Um J_P_ staggered away from it and Ah. Mm-hmm. Okay. S Um I haven't I haven't had any discussions with him since. Well, he's ph he's physically here. If we want to pay him for some more time we can do that. Would that be a just better use of our time in get Yeah. Right. But m he he he is around and I believe. And if if the if i if it's a Right. But if um if everybody has a lot to do and, you know, Joe could give it a couple of hours, which i is what it might take just to fix it, then let's do it because starting run-time is now getting to be fairly urgent. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. But we can't we can't make Joe do this ec alright, so there's uh some trade-off between availability and speed from start to finish, given that this is somebody else's code. So you know. Right, so we're we're b we're building models. Right. We're we um We have the design somewhere. Mm. Hmm. Well Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. I think so. 'Cause um I have to check back with with J_P_ fairly soon. Okay, he wanted to kn um The eighteen the next eighteen month plan, great. Deliverables, great. Progress with the experiment, well that's what we're doing now. Okay. So what do we think, if you have a fairly hectic week, are we looking for subjects next week? Okay. Ads go up. Yeah, I do. I do. But I think ad should probably go up this week. We want people for n for next week. Is that okay? Is anybody now terrified at the thought that we're live next week? There are people coming in here one after another. Or p two two after two, more likely. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, is the is this is this generalised is this generalised anxiety, Robin? Or do you have a specific thing that okay. So aside from the usual angst which we all suffer when we go live. So we w we wanna do some piloting at the end of the week? Right. Okay. Right. S Right. She's using but she's actually relaxed that somewhat. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ostensibly booked time, which isn't Okay. We've but we have we have a solid booking for all the mornings anyway. Right? And l except by permission of us, alright. We own it. Um so we can change that. I mean they everybody acknowledged the the other week that we that we had priority. Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. Don't worry. Um there's there's a booking system, right. So it's public what's booked and what isn't. Okay. No. Alright, maybe w should get on there and book mornings as far as the eye can see. Alright. Uh-huh. Yeah, just a well we think we spoke to all the people who who used those facilities the other day. But we could be wrong. So Huh. Right. Um well the two key holders are here. Oh I see. From Caroline? Or the general office? The general office. I see. But no, they need a they need an account on this machine to actually to use it. They need account on these machines so that they could book. They couldn't actually log in. Mm-hmm. Okay. We're also working on a way of making sure that the matin that the machines return to zero state when they're when you come off them. because the it's the people have been leaving var um well, people have been leaving various bits of who knows what around on them, right, which which we think is what's critical. Okay. Um piloting piloting piloting. You have we have to build the things. We have to try the machi th things. We have to check them with Marloes and J_P_ that they like the representation, the variables, right. How about uh you have any time on Friday? I get a email back. Maybe you and I should be the pilot subjects. First pilot subjects, the ones who um know which questions we wanna ask. And then we should get another pair who are naive to the whole thing. Okay. This is generalised floating anxiety. No no. It's it's it's wisdom. But yeah. Well um because actually we can I mean uh, you know, if we make comments, they feed back in a lo into the development.",EN2009d
"And it's always the other way around, that's how you put it on. I think the the most of the bad words are at the beginning when the people try to put in on. Huh. Whoo. Ah, I cannot put it. Oh no no, not at all. Well Geneva, that's why I'm here at IDIAP, because I attended Geneva Eurospeech. I c Why, why you cannot? Mm-hmm. Exactly. Meet Okay, so you attended mostly posters, I guess. So how many presentation you you I realised it were that there were panel discussions only at the place where I could see the the t t you know, there were some boards saying that there is some panel discussion, uh but I I couldn't get no one knew where is it, what it is, where it happens and why and so forth. It was com Yeah. Finally I found, but Well, this is not this speech is not restricted only to papers and these things, you know. So how did you like Lisbon then? Yeah. Yeah, w we went to the Costa Caparica there, with the bus. We we were we were supposed to take take the direct one, but we didn't. North? Okay, so you stayed at the at the same coast, not not you didn't go to the island, cross the river where where is the bridge and and then okay, so that was a different place. Yeah, with Hamed uh Hemant and these people. The more south to th the hole through the water. Huh. I was I was very surprised that even the trams did have a A_C_ there. I couldn't see it at at all. Yeah, r right, but can you imagine something like in? Uh it's A_C_. Well, it it was much better if if if you would have to spend a hour and a half that uh Hemant and the others spent while going with a ca uh with a bus to to the conference centre from from the the hotel that we were. There was a direct bus and it took them hour and a half then. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, that was the right choice, but to take something which which was uh direct, in quotes. It was n not the f direct as anything else, but. Uh it sounds sounds like. Let's go on, this was just a Of what? Pruning of covariance matrix. But what what does it mean tied then? Uh yeah, but then you have to store the whole matrix and plus some extra information what is tied to what or b Yeah, but Uh I don't know about anything like this, but Tying. Mm. But ooh the the main point is to to uh like make it faster, the the the decoding, or what? Well that's possible, why why it should be i impossible? So it's completely impossible to do it with full covariance matrix? Why? Yeah, computationally e expensive, but Of course, from the point of view of computation, but otherwise it's there's no problem, no? with okay. Okay, so so here you have to choose either many many things to store and huge computation uh Yeah, yeah. No. Uh depends. So. So there are no results there? No Hmm yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Why it has to be online? Okay. Like extended as as more as much as possible to keep the okay. Of course, of course. Whoo. Yeah, it's right. This is maybe because of F_F_T_U_ or these things. It's no not as small as as it should have been, but mayb maybe because of other processing after. No? Yeah. Well noisy, yes. Overlap you mean. Uh w how do you mean to say? Uh Um I have two questions, first is essentially how he's doing in that. No, well uh once he gets the frame, like from here to here, then where he advances to to start with c computation of the next frame? Yeah, mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Fu ok okay, so do what do you mean full? Some some sub-window or the the whole ten seconds of speech or what? It has to be also some somehow Okay, something longer window than the one we are speaking about, okay? Uh w Okay, so you have a window and then you split it to s two parts and you shift the the point where you split it or okay. Okay, splitting point, okay. Okay. Okay, so basically we have two fixed points. Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay, so once you have say one hour of speech, you start at the beginning, and first you try with twenty milliseconds. Then you shift to twenty five and so forth until you Okay, and and you find the point where where what? Where where do you stop actually? Yeah, mm I know, but you start at twenty and go to sixty, but where which point do you choose? Uh okay, but which which likelihood ratio? Okay. Yeah, but uh likelihood, that's something and something. W what is likelihood? Okay. Yeah, but it has to yeah. Okay. So it's basic So Mm. Yeah. Yeah, but still. If Mm Yeah, but why do the main value which are comparing to, the the the overall value or overall likelihood or whatever you call it, why he's using the whole signal for this? Because so if the whole signal was uh steady somehow and it it would be able to be modelled by L_P_ model, well, then the residue will be very low. So he's supposing that the whole signal won't be able to to be captured by L_P_ model and that the residue would be high enough or ho wh why he's comparing the o to to the overall? You know, I I don't see the point of dividing over the the whole stuff. Y well, sounds sounds reasonable. I see, I see, I see. Okay, that's reasonable. Because actually if it if if uh the whole signal would be able to be modelled by L_ uh by L_P_C_ then anyway he has to design some some framing. So even if it's very stationary by d um by dividing over this whole stuff, he is able to find some reasonable boundaries. Um m ma makes sense um. Okay. And Mm. That has to be power, not energy definitely, no? Yeah, but it has to be normalised. By the length. Then power, instead of energy. Energy over length is power. Yeah, yeah. Duh duh duh duh duh. Okay. So but this so two things I still don't understand, thi this is supposed to be only for M_F_C_C_s and these easy features ah, one question I I wanted to ask before, does does he preserve within the feature vector the framing he's using finally, because does he somehow put the information about was the size about the frame to the feature vector itself or he's throwing away this framing? Something like this, because the recogniser could be good for the recogniser to know what was the chosen framing by this extraction. Okay. So so it n uh it might be bad for then for the back end, it might screw up the the t speech rate or normaliser. Huh. Oh, probably I didn't get it too, so the framing is actually equi-distant. Just the windows are wider oh ah, I see. Because it would be crazy, yeah, a little bit. Oh I see, so so it's it's like this. Yeah. I cannot imagine the transformation to get the modulation spectrum out of such a stuff. Uh. Mm. So why don't you still use it? If it works so well. Yeah, but you do the speech coding, so do you still use it? Why? Mm. Uh. Uh it's interesting, this. Well there should be after each conference there should be something like ten people should sit down, read the papers, and then rank them. You know, a all the all the all the similar papers within one session say sp uh focus to this topic, and say this is the best, this works slightly worse than this one, and throw away what is not that good and and th the first three three papers which are the best shou should be implemented and used from from that time onwards, like forget the all the M_F_C_C_s, because it's too old, and then start building the story on the new stuff and not 'cause it's Yeah, it is but I know, I know, uh th this is just a theory. Because Mm yeah. Yes, and I want to yeah. Yeah. It looks like Mm. Yeah? Yeah. Because to me it seems that everyone is still comparing to P_L_P_s or M_F_C_C_s, and there are so many new systems and everything is new, but it baseline is still uh t twenty years old and Yeah? Uh yeah. No okay, so So it should be every papers then should contain all the results from NIST evaluation or some standard task then. Otherwise Uh uh that's the other yeah. Okay, so it could be you you would have to publish the results on this standard task, and then you could say well, I also tried on this and this Yeah. You know, but then then only it makes some progress, this. Mm. Yeah, but can for for example can you use from some data from from the L_T_ world? For training say? Yeah, but they give you also training data or only the testing data? Oh, i uh since this is only okay. Okay, so so they give you only the training or development data only? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Uh. Al almost. Yeah. We are a couple of people at IDIAP and there are already two s two different setups. Stories and numbers, or Yeah. Uh I think we use di distinct train and test set, even se the different sets of phonemes. Different Well, I don't use only digits. My M_L_P_s are trained on everything and uh test set is digits, yeah. For for what? Ah. Yeah. Yeah, you cannot play with that. Because of the voices wouldn't be comparable then. Uh. Hmm. Because who is the one who makes who actually uses what we d try to do here? These are companies or because it's not scientists, scientists just start from P_L_P_ and then design the new features, new back end, or new anything, but they start from the old stuff. But who is the one who is using these results which we publish and try to make Yeah, but once you once you finish your P_H_D_ you go and it's over. And those who don't? They stay and publish another papers and they but they they don't turn into a life, no? into life. Mm uh-huh. Because I I won Yes. I wonder which level they are using out of what is there. Hmm. Yeah. They grab Hmm. Hmm. Okay, so we can hope that Nokia will be using tandem tandem P_L_P_s. Yeah, I cannot. Huh. So it's not related to ICSI. Yeah, but it was Mm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Because they grab whatever is certain to work, and they they use it. They don't use anything which is to uh too new which is not that safe. It's like a it's like a NASA, you know, they use four, eight four, eight, six, machines to to to to put two n uh space ships, because it's it's known to work perfectly well or Pentium, not any P_ four or whatever, because it's safe, it has been working for twenty years, and then only it safe to put well not twenty but it's always yeah yeah, of course. Of course. Mm yeah. Mm. Hynek also told about this Cohen ce cell phone, which he was showing to to work l uh with the L_V_C_S_R_. He he was saying that there is something really really uh simple, the decoder I mean, not the features, but he was mentioning something to the decoder. This is just there is almo Yeah, something like no D_T_W_ or something, I don't know, I'm not really sure, but he mention that Hmm? That was impressive. Yeah, but it's that's a similar one to what Herve has, for example some he was showing it uh live on M_L_M_I_ c last M_L_M_I_ conference. You can look at the video and play it uh. It uh I'm not sure. Yes, commercial phone. What do you mean, always? Well, they they just bought a mobile, and based on the O_S_ it's using they they they developed the software. No, this is the development phone, this is not the commercial stuff with the software. They just use the device. By by what? I don't know if it's already the case right now. You had to get used to the system, not the system to you. It's nice. By the way, you should be the one to ask is there anything if I'm just a p private person and I want for free any software which is able to read me a book in English, uh for example that Festival, am I able to put the text to the system and to in real time to listen to the output? Festival is able to to to read just a mm normal plain text in reasonable comprehensible English or so that I can understand it? Non-native speaker? Mm okay. Yeah. And it's in real time on a reasonable machine? Okay. Okay. 'Cause the the diphone that I was tried to install it and there there are the voices like cat voice and these voices, this is not the one? Because uh I don't know which which um what i what is running where uh if it's diphone or which uh approach this is. Yes? So it's uh just uh wha samples of the diphones, and it choo chooses Yeah, on my on my laptop. Or here. Yeah, you can you can easily yes, I d I've tried, but there are some built-in like easy voices which you can y uh there is a default one completely synthetic, which you cannot understand at all, and th then there is a diphone synthesis I think it is the diphone synthesis from the some like something like cat w voice and somethi this is so-so, but it's this doesn't sound very nice, and we were playing at the uh summer school with them, actually with the authors, and they were playing us some other other approaches, and it it sounded like a human, it was great, but Yeah. So this is not this is not for free or something. But it it's not here so far. Okay, I'm I'm fine with this, but I can make it run on my machine. Okay. Okay. And and the engine is is in the Festival itself. So it's just a voice to to okay. okay. Mm-hmm. Mm mm. Okay. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Okay. Uh it's right, I mean Yeah, I just s use the Douglas Adams, uh uh that that book, you know, the mm how it's called? Just general English textbook, I I cho I tried. No, the T_ T_X_T_. Yeah, ASCII file basically. You have to but you can take a P_D_F_ and convert P_D_F_ to ASCII. Yeah. It was a line with hashes and it was hash hash hash hash hash hash hash hash hash hash. Uh I'm not, then I don't want to go too much into details, just a little bit. Mm well I can prepare s sorry. These are the Edinburgh people, no? Mm-hmm, yeah, voice. That I know. Um uh. N uh. N uh. Mm.
Okay. So you start I think, right? Yeah, so we are going to talk about the papers from Interspeech. This is not a good question, I think. All of them, of course. All of them, of course. Oh yeah, that's true. Okay. Bad answer, right? Like Yeah, I it's not every year, right. Yeah, we met in also in I_C_S_L_P_, right? The first time, so. Yeah. So how how did you like the conference anyway? When in compared to to th the others, the previous one. But Yeah. Right. Oh yeah. He was from Australia, right? The guy yeah. Uh he's very famous I think for that, right? He's the the inventor of that implant and for for the ear I think. S yeah. Mm. So you went to a beach? To a like Atlantic sea coast or yeah? Uh-huh. Uh it's not so far from Lisbon, half an hour, mm-hmm. Uh northwest mm. Yeah. Yeah. But I think Lisbon those days are pretty good, like seem to me quite not cold but still okay, like reasonable. Oh yeah. Yeah, I was happy to be back in Suisse after few few days it's better to be here I think. Yeah, it's big city, many people and Yeah, yeah. Those new only, right? Not the old one, but yeah. Yeah. Ah it's not necessary to have it, maybe. Some time, yes, but not so many days or Oh yeah, yeah, that's true. Conference. Yeah, yeah. It's Better to ta Yeah. The easiest way. I don't remember the name. Is it there? Yeah, i it's supposed to be there. Oh, you've got the s Yeah. Uh-huh. Like No, I don Right, mm-hmm. Yeah. So they obtain better results with that finally or But Right. But if you compare no, if you compare it with some baseline, let's say you use just G_M_M_ with diagonal covariance matrices A and no decorrelation before like uh Yeah. Or L_D_A_ is there or Yeah. But but there must be the sense, right? Because once you decorrelate the data, then you don't need to have full I know, that's so that's that means that the decorrelation is not uh optimal, right? So so that's the reason. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. It is, yeah. Uh no, there there is not Yeah. Right. Right, right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, definitely. It's almost impossible for like L_V_C_ aside, impossible to use it, right? You've got dimension thirty nine times thirty nine? Yeah? So yeah. It's impossible to use it. And you cannot even train it, right? More or less I think. Oh, so that's interesting. Mm-hmm. Much longer. Shorter, yeah. Right. Wh what is the minimum and maximum? So it's not so mm Two point five milliseconds. Twenty milliseconds? From Oh, yeah. Right. Sure. And the shifting is still the same, or not? O yeah, yeah, overlap. So Like um no, how many frames per per second you do have? Is it again like uh one hundred frames, or it's less or even if you keep variable length of the frames, right? You can still keep the same frame rate. Because I understand this would have sense for, I don't know, speech coding where you want to preserve uh or you want to encode it into less frames, right, but why do why to do it for speech recognition? It means that uh Yeah, no, wha why to keep variabl variability in the length of the frames? Wh why not to keep the same length, what is the Yeah. Right. Right, right, right. Mm-hmm. Right, right, right, ri right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right, yes. Right, yeah. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Well Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, probably. No, I don't think so. There is no information. Hmm. Yeah yeah yeah, right, right, right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it might be difficult. Mm mm-hmm, probably. Who knows, maybe it's possible to use it somehow, but then there is uh information about temporal information is somehow included in such yeah. Yeah. There is also some um like uh not paper, but I saw the algorithm I have been using even that called temporal decomposition, I don't know if you kn you know that like Uh I don't know who propose it, I just had it from from BEAMbot for like a BEAMbot, do you know the guy? He's French um somewhere now in teleconference like mm I don't know where he's working, but th we were using it for uh speech coding, so we just had a speech and you had decompose a speech into such segments, temporal segments which were stationary inside. And then you can more or less uh quantise those segments somehow and use it for encoding let's say, or and it worked prett yeah, yeah. They were using like S_V_D_ stuff, singular value decomposition for that and it worked pretty well, like I was surprised like. Yeah, yeah, exactly, uh he was using that. Yeah. Oh well, it's it has been used for speech coding. Nob nobody use it for recognition stuff I think, I never heard that. No, I don't of course. Yeah, that's good question. Maybe. Right. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's true. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's true. That's important. All the papers. Okay. I think people wouldn't like it. Many people wouldn't like it. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah sure. Exactly. Right. And everybody's uh like uh using different training and testing data and then you don't know if like They show it works for TIMIT, but then you try to use some different databases, you see it doesn't work. Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah, you can. Yeah, exactly, yeah yeah yeah. NIST evaluations. Yeah, but nobody you know, it's those new systems are still not general, like you know, like those P_L_P_ and M_F_C_C_s, because everybody knows that di it worked somehow, right, for any kind of data. That's why they're comparing to to that, so. Once somebody will come with something new, okay, he he's showing it works for some datas, but still yeah, yeah. First it's difficult to to show that it works for all all the datas, right, because it's really and Yeah. Yeah, that's your choice. Mm-hmm. No no, i just for Yeah. I think so, yeah, probably, mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ri I It's just T_T_S_, right, text to speech? Right. Mm-hmm. Right, right. Are they? For O_G_I_s? For O_G_I_ numbers? Different setups? Like some people use this setup and some people that? Uh-huh. So you just Oh yeah. No, uh it's. I dunno, I I've been working with that and Right, yeah, yeah. For noise conditions, yeah, it's pretty good. Well, th those f recognisers are are made there or just you just use them, that's it. You don't have to play with it. She even is f it was forbidden in the time, right, so you have recogniser, just use it. Don't play with it You just play with the features. Yeah, right, exactly. So. Yeah, yeah. Ri right. Yeah, yeah, I remember. With David Pearce he was. Yeah yeah, exactly. We are using those results more or less. But not everybody go. Not everybody. Many people stay, so. Yeah. Yeah, sure. But exactly. No. Well, many people place with Tandem, right, like M_I_T_ or who is using that some not M_I_T_, but somebody I dunno, Hynek told told us that somebody's using that um very actively, like okay, it it works for them and and they are close to like industry like uh you know, there is it's a research group of I know, I don't think it's ICSI. Somebody else or I don't know, somebody new uh s but I think some t somebody like A_T_ and A_T_ and T_ or what? Oh qu yeah. You me I don't know, he's even if Qualcomm? No. Now y oh yeah yeah. For right, right. No, I don't know if it's Yeah, I think so. Yeah, definitely. Maybe they are using P_L_P_s and but I th I believe that there is still some stuff up to yeah, for RASTA or whatever else, like all those decorrelations and transformations. I think it's there, but more or less it's again based on M_F_C_C_s or something like that. Or maybe traps. No, more or less I think yeah. Right. That's true, it's true. But that's different situation, because right? They need that it doesn't create that much, yeah. If something happened with the machine and uh I don't kn the alloc system, it doesn't matter, right? Somebody will fix it and change it, but Sure. Yeah. Even even not Viterbi, just even something simpler. Yeah. Uh I don't know. Do you think so? Yeah? Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah, that's true. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Even on the phone. N some new one or From that C Cohen's? Oh, uh-huh. And but which uh phone it is? F Samsung, something? Where uh some but some which you can buy, right? It's It and you can train it, like only your speech or it's general uh it's quite interesting, yeah. Okay, uh-huh. Or you you can just buy that application, right? I don't know, like it's like you you've got some mobile phone, and then you can buy from another company some such application wh you can dictate your S_M_S_ or whatever. S I don't know if it is done now, but like But have you ever used like dictation system for Windows? Those uh there were many of them. Yeah, drag the mouse there. And I heard that it worked very very well. Um Alright. Right, newer speech, okay. Okay. How to say okay. Mm-hmm. I think, yeah yeah, definitely. It's based on the diphones diphones, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think it's very good, yeah. Mm-hmm. So you've got it installed in your machine here or Festival, right? Okay. Oh. A and have you have you tried it? And? So you can Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's very difficult and Yeah, yeah. And you just uh have chosen some text? Any text you just put in and Okay. And it can read uh how does it read, from which um from which uh how to state it? Uh is it uh possible to read P_D_F_s or just standard text? Whatever, T_X_T_, right, files. Uh-huh. Yeah. Well let's Oh really? Anyway, who is the author of Festival? Edinburgh? And I thought it that's the guy from C_S_L_U_, from Portland, who was there during f Yeah, but there was No, no, but that that was the guy who's on a wheelchair now, he cannot m move even, he's very in like indic how to say that? Like he cannot have he just can speak only through some Festival system or something like that. He was the auth no, yeah, h he was working I think in w O_G_I_ even, he's very famous, but I thought that he was the author no, it was developed for him, like he was just first tester I think of the system. Something like that. Like it's not t text to speech, it's just the uh uh synthesis, which means which is more or less the same, but I dunno. Yeah. So it's somebody and Simon King is playing with that, right, the t guy. Okay, okay. I think that's enough. No other papers it's just one paper and and Festival. From Linux, it's very im interesting. Yeah.
At this precise time, yeah. Uh you can't attend multiple session at the same time, so. Hmm. Mm-hmm, yeah in. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. But yeah. Yeah. I liked the invited speaker um about the implant in the ear. It's quite good, no? I think so, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Hmm. Hmm. No quite good uh. A bit hot still, but the bea the beach nearby is quite nice, yeah. You should try it, I don't know. Did you go around? Before or after, yeah. Okay. Yeah, 'cause I Yeah, I stayed I stayed two days before, so uh I went you ju you just take the train, maybe that's the same, I'm not sure. Train north. Half an hour train, yeah. Yeah. West or north, I don't know uh. No no no, not very far. No no. It's different, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Well y We can take the tram and a train. It's it's all conditioned. Yeah. Ah. Mm.. Ah, sorry. No no no it's uh or s I'm not sure. Yeah. Yeah, originally I brought it because I marked some papers, but yeah. Onl only o one which surprised me a bit, it was uh speaker recognition I think, but it doesn't really matter. They were trying to model uh um covariance of different components for G_M_M_, instead of using a diagonal. But then if you use a full it's too much. So they use some approach where they tie them automatically and uh after that well, it's more like tying it is still full, but different um components are tied, different components of the matrix are tied. Equal. Uh No no, you have to store a minimum number a reduced number of parameters, and they are tied in a linear way actually, sorry, not equal, but it doesn't Yeah, exactly, that's it uh. So they ju yeah. Yeah. Interesting thing is that they applied it on speaker recognition, and on the features before they had three different ways to um decorrelate the features, and and this they showed it uh without this, with diagonal G_M_M_ or with this, and with this, with uh semi-tied covariance matrices, it was a less much less sensitive to uh which um decorrelation procedure you choose. If y so. A a also better, but of course it depends on the number of of parameters you put Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I I think I think it was even slightly better, yeah. Maybe I can find it. L_D_A_, yeah, L_D_A_. Make it possible to use uh a full covariance matrix. Yeah. Yeah it's this one. It's i improved covariance modelling. Yeah. No, but in the proceedings you can find them. They are better, yeah. They tried P_C_A_, L_D_A_, M_L_L_T_. I i it's not really anything new, but uh the mm they just applied that to speaker I_D_. Yeah. Yeah. I isn't it smaller, the minimum, no? I don't know, I just Mm. Mm. Yeah, okay. But it's not uh an intrinsic limitation, it's just because of ri yeah. Okay. So it's not n it's not symmetric necessarily? 'Kay. So he's maximising that or mm Mm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, ho yeah. How did you cope with what you mentioned some time before, that if it's a very long session for each twelve point five frame you will actually get the same segment now. So how d Ah, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Sorry. Mm uh what it's a little bit what NIST is trying to do, no? So. Yeah, bu Yeah, but then we all optimise uh on the same task. So you cannot get anything new out of that after some time. Yeah, but then you run out of time. No, i ideally you're correct, uh but Mm. So yeah. Ho how how do they how do they evaluate? I just don't know. So they ask peop they ask people to sit and listen basically? Yeah? Hmm. Okay. But they d they don't have any measure like you have an original speech, you transcribe it and Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. So maybe well, but then well no, if somebody like NIST will have one recogniser and you just plug a different feature, but uh it's dangerous. Right. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Hem Hemant is using difference Seems Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Would be mm would be nice for Aurora maybe to have that. Aur Aurora. Yeah. No no, but yeah, yeah. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, Daimler, yeah. I don't know. You know, they're extremely secretive. I had a hard time just to get the signals. So I asked other questions but uh it's quite tough, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they have to yeah. They have yeah, they have to do some test in their Mercedes, some speech recognition test, mm but it seems now they mm at least Daimler, they mostly work on dialogue management, uh but not much on features and recognition. No. Yeah. I d I mm. I doubt they are trying right now. I doubt that at Daimler they are trying right now, but maybe other companies, mm. Uh. Cohen? Jorda Jordan Cohen. No no. Mm. Mm. But there you could send an S_M_S_ I think, or something like that. Uh you could dictate text, so. On a phone, yeah. The phone that uh Cohen yeah, voice signals. Yeah. I don't know, that's Okay. Hmm. So it's still still real time? Hmm. Ah okay, but but not much, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Alright. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Okay. Hmm so we all attended Interspeech, no? So how many sessions you attended? I mean did you attend any any session? Yeah. That's really that's really your So any general impression or feedback? So f for any of you it's a first conference or maybe for? No, I mean in the sense that it's uh Interspeech is really big conference for speech, so did you attend before? Uh, ok ok yeah, o ok yeah, so then you're hiding a you have attended before yes. Yeah, I see see. Yeah, yeah. I t I Uh I think it's quite interesting, but only annoying thing is this multiple sessions. And most sometimes you can't able to go to oral talk this oral presentations most of the time, because because like posters is you can spend a lot of time posters looking at m many posters than sitting twenty minutes for one oral presentation. So in t twenty minutes you can see at least two, three posters, and you can directly talk to people, so. Even I found like uh very few people in some oral presentations. I think most of the people are like their own posters only. Yeah, how presentations are hardly handful of like f five or more. Yeah. Ah, ok. Hmm yeah. Ah, okay. Yeah. Even some panel discussions on that human speech recognition reducing gap between the A_S_R_ and and H_S_R_. It was a bit interesting, lot of arguments and Yeah, b differently it's mainly the differences different approaches of engineers versus linguists or phoneticians and yeah mm. Ah, okay. Yeah, even the panel discussions w I think one is really held in small room, so people were really crowded. Yeah, it's Yeah,. Yeah. Ah ok we went to like far south, to Lagos and yeah, that wa uh ha yeah. That was really good, those beaches are really good. Yeah, even dolphin in the yeah. But the weather was really hot, the south it's more than thirty five. Uh. Lisbon was good, um little bit bit mm. Yeah, even local transport, it's it's. But yeah, most of the time the buses are really crowded. Uh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because it's really big city, no? No like. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. No, re yeah, but that's that's not good, direct bus is not good like. So you can go to the direct uh ce central place and then occas uh. Mm. Yeah, da Uh what is the place, uh the the central I mean where we change the bus to yeah, in the yeah, maybe you can check the booklet. Yeah it's there, like I used to find bus numbers from book only. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. It's like uh in It's like uh all the semi-tied covariance matrices or yeah. So did they reduce it's in between the direct covariance this is full covariance. Should try to reduce some parameters by tying. Oh. Uh. Ah, okay. Yeah. Mm. In your tie-in. No, I think they got good results with just using diagonals or definitely yeah. Yeah. Mm. Maybe decorrelation again they do D_C_T_ or K_L_T_ or they do that? L_D_A_ or like Yeah. So No, but still there is there is still ev that's why like people come Yeah, definitely it's not optimum. So it's it's also like doing along along the diagonals all again. It's really computationally really uh yeah so see suppose if thirty nine in te thirty nine to thirty nine for every yeah, yeah, so Uh there is a thing Yeah. Ne no problem, but if you see so many models and so many mixtures yeah. But Yeah, thirty you can see you c you can't really like even you can't the models itself is like thirty eight times more than that, so. So y if you have like five megabytes or ten megabytes of models then yeah. But even I think it's really bit like impossible for the really big systems I guess, like storing storing itself. Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, it's really ti Yeah yeah, for every you're so you're to store all this thirty Yeah. So from Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Speak uh yeah, different task and So uh I found one paper interesting. I think you know Vivek most of you know. Uh this is uh Vivek's paper on like variable scale feature extraction. Normally we use to fix it window for feature extraction, like twenty five milliseconds or thirty seconds. Here he's proposing variable scale, because the fixed scale is non-optimal for it's non-optimum because like for vowels you can have m much longer, and for plosives and these things you really shorter, like even around less than twenty milliseconds also. So he's ki proposing like this variable scale window f uh kind of online for each segment. Yeah mm mm you can do like you can measure and you can do but he's mm basically doing some mm likelihood ratio testing. So if so the main idea is like suppose you have uh one segment, so he's trying to find the stationality cautious stationality of that segment. Yeah, as much as possible like but yeah, definitely you have to assume some l uh like minimum and maximum sizes of your own, so he is using minimum of minimum is uh I think twe I don't twelve point five milliseconds I think. Maximum is uh sixty milliseconds. So the minimum No no, I think a minimum is twen twenty milliseconds is i yeah. Twelve point five milliseconds is kind of sift. Twenty millis minimum is no no, de because of uh No, you can use mol yeah. No, mainly because of uh M_F_C_C_ computation, because yeah, it becomes really noisy, like if you s yeah, ten milliseconds means you have only eighty samples for uh and then you have refused twenty four filters, the filters won't get any samples, so. Yeah, because of computation. So even I I think even st uh he can find less than twenty millisecond windows also, especially for plosives uh. Shifting yeah, he's using twelve point five millise yeah, shifting is almost same. But the problem like He Yeah. Yeah, he's keeping same number of frames. Uh he's using uh twelve point five yeah, twelve point five millisecond Yeah. Number of uh frames? W you want to Actually the problem's again uh uh you see the shift is the Nyquist frequency if you compared modulation spectrum. So again, if you change this shift, the mod the Nyquist the modulation spectrum, Nyquist frequency changes for each window. So if you want to do again another high-level feature extraction again, it will be problem, so. So but he's uh like he's he discuss I mean describing this, because even this itself is a problem, keeping the f uh fix to frame size, because you're analysing your this uh segment many times. So this shift will suppose if you find one segment of sixty milliseconds, and then you're doing this ten millisecond so every almost I think yeah, mm uh yeah, five frames y you're analysing the previ this already segment so. So again, this may blur some frequency transitions or yeah, but the problem is again this uh bottleneck is here, like you can't change your Nyquist frequency modulation and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's so uh so the main idea is like first to take the some some window, some sam some samples, then he assume somewhere some variable and point there is a change. Then then it's not symmetric, i you can cho uh y it's basically uh too like again, do for all the samples in that gyro. So then what he does is like he proposed uh like some like ratio test based on maximum likelihood. So th tha that is really simple, like so what he does is like so he he computes the residual, he first he does the L_P_ analysis and then he computes the residual, and he takes the residual energy of f full signal like gy gy gyro samples. The full signal. So maybe I can The wh the whole window. No, that's that like he assumes yeah, sixty milliseconds or something he start with, so so then he can yeah, yeah. Yeah, then he can split that window at point N_ say point N_, so then you will have gyro two no, you can segment it maybe. Yeah, so yes, he's supposed this is your p window. So then you can move your like this. You can move your point, so that then this will be like one and this will be second. But again, he assumes some initial uh sizes for these windows. Yeah. He don't start with the yeah, he don't s yeah, start with gyro sample or something. He's starting with uh so the l left window is starts at twenty milliseconds, so so you already hear like s suppose this is full signal, you're already here. So right window is should end at twelve point two, so you're to search basically in this range. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and then if you the maximum is sixty millisecond frame for him. So if you don't find anything Sixty milliseconds. If you d No, the point is depending on the likelihood ratio. So he got so he supposed this so this is suppose se segment one, and this is segment two. So he compute this error here. So and then he p gives some kind of in terms of this residual letter. So this residual letter is for full gyro samples. Then there would be suppose this point is say N_. So gyro to N_ and then like So this the b basically the main he questions or here Yeah, he's for finding the likelihood for full frame, and then it's basically likelihood ratio test, so he's comparing the likelihood of the full segment divided by the likelihood of the the sub-segments. Likelihood of the uh like this likelihood is uh this error estimate of the residual. So residual power he can compare t so he after do after doing L_P_ he can get a l residual and then he can compare the power of the residual. So that he's proving that power is again maximum likelihood estimate of your L_P_ parameters. So that which interesting it's you don't really need to do a lot of computation, you just need to take the error of n uh residual of this full window and then residual of energy of the sub-windows and then you can just divide them and then the only thing is like again he has to use some threshold to decide, that that's only the p problem. He got uh he's founding something more uh around three or three point five E_S_T_ optimum threshold, but the and another advantage is like it's not really changing speech recognition, whatever, so not really changing because of the threshold, so. Uh you don't really need to f like fiddle with threshold a lot, so mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, this is yeah, I understand. This is this is the actually basically some theoretical proof, like maybe if you want threshold you can see and he's coding from uh Leven like uh. No, this is from again yeah, statistical signal processing. What they say here is like suppose if you analyse two distinct or uh this L_P_ analysis in the same stationary analysis window, the coding will always be greater than the ones resulting from this analysis in two windows. Two stationary windows. So the he's basically based on this theorem, so so what he's saying is like if you do this error, it will be always greater than the mm th these errors of two stationary windows. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah, this maybe I think yeah, this he's getting some improvement, but Yeah yeah yeah yeah. So he's just uh uh he's normalising the energy coefficient, because energy is really affected a lot. Uh so he's li Energy like, because C_ gyro component like, so he's using M_F_C_C_ so he's normalising the C_ gyro component for this t yeah. Power is again like yeah yeah yeah yeah, it's time like yeah. It's okay like samples, or you can see root mean square energy or something. Yeah. Yeah. No. No, n no, you vo what you mean like the window lent. The sixty mil no, it i it doesn't really Uh but I think it's he he doesn't use I guess, because uh uh then like you just you take these features and you train model, so. It really matters wh what frame shift you're using for models, like because how many he needs to use same freq No no, wait. No, he will get like every ten milliseconds he get one fra one features, like he it doesn't really depend, because suppose if you take your t case, like you your window i maybe longer, so doesn't really matter like how what size window you use or not. But I tell uh at every ten milliseconds whether you give some features or not really matters, no? Like so. So it doe you can use uh thirty milliseconds or fifty millisecond window. Same. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah, framing it's like it's really yeah. Yeah, if you have if you're change framing, it's really I think even it's really problem, no? Like if you try even models also I guess, if you change. It's not only with this model, it's in spectra and shifts in deltas, because Yeah, but it's really complicated I think. If you use yeah, that becomes really Yeah. But this is kind of interesting. Yeah yeah yeah, the temporal dec. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, first this is proposed by like uh even we read one paper in our reading group, you remember that? I have implemented, it's quite working well, like uh yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, Honza is also worked for his be yeah. Uh i yeah. Ne he was re he was quoting But that Yeah, he was uh quoting that paper also, like v he was telling this uh this is kind of optimisation criteria what this temporal decomposition is doing like. You're trying to segment your s signal into like discreet windows and then so but he was telling like this uh relationship between optimation and and then cautious stationality is not really obvious. So stationality is again different, no? Stationality is this is optimation, we want to like see some signal, few segments, which can really represent whole, so maybe that's why like this may not be really Yeah. Yeah, this one yeah, he's getting some improvement n uh this is a, yeah. No no no, they again But again uh, getting that ten papers is really difficult task. It takes maybe years and again uh it definitely like who will who will choose the ten papers like, and if we asked yeah, but yeah, those things are practically kind of really but I think this kind of things what you showed I mean what you said is really good, like if people start implementing like some people propose something in feature level, some propose in something in model level, but these two are really independent, no? When really work combine these two or Yeah, especially features, like suppose if somebody come with different good features, again people st again use M_F_C_C_s No no, it it's not really sure also, make suppose uh people you can't really force people to use same features, so so they wo they will be happy with their own features and their own scripts, so their bit rate like tend to change features every time and it's Hmm. But even NIST you can Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Then So at lea especially L_V_C_S_R_ in really big systems, then people Yeah. Yeah. Because yeah, it's it's again you don't know. Oh. No, then uh there will be only one conference in three years or something for speech, because But again like That's so you can publish only once in three years or Yeah. But even people are doing suppose in Interspeech there was uh some challenge for speech synthesis, so so what's is uh like it challenge was really good, like sup they give the database, so you have to work on that database. What technique t use is it's your choice like, but that database and then the results analysis is they decide, so. Even speech recognition also some tests are coming, like for phone segmentation or something. People give some database and then you have to dis you can use whatever you want and you have to produce even for features also like features also I think Yeah yeah, the they they designed the data such a way that it's it's really like really real uh data. No no, for s nay, speech synthesis it's like they give you some data, so whether like you use for training or l you can you can do like data driven or like model based approach or whatever like. At the end then they will ask you to synthesise some sentence and you have to synthesise them and then you have to send them Your training data, onl no development, training, no yeah, training Evaluate it's again subject to s uh because for speech synthes yeah. Yeah, listen and yeah d yeah, even uh they it's mostly they use native speakers only, because they can really judge well, so. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah, yeah yeah. So even they propose some kind of word error rate. So you have the original speech, so i the synthesised speech, is there any words which are not matching? So even speech synthesis, they're also uh introduced this W_E_R_ term, so. Uh. But this was really quite successful like in this conference, Interspeech. So a lot of people participated in uh I think even they're continuing this for uh next year and Text to speech. But uh I heard like even for I_CASSP next year there is some com uh like computation by Martin Krug, Sheffield, and on this feature extraction stuff and so at least if you make task simple focus, then it may be good to compare these features and but if you s use some uh large vocabulary system, it takes t six months to build and at the end you don't know whether your features are really uh so. So maybe that's for like people are always using P_L_P_s or M_F_C_C_s, it's it's such a b like lot of time involved, so you can't really check many thi Yeah, yeah yeah yeah. But at least in IDIAP we have this numbers recogniser is almost kind of free, so everybody is using so that's what we are doing, no? Almost almost like we are putting different features and I think yeah, yeah, numbers recogniser is not really different from like uh a f at least in IDIAP we have almost same, but maybe you are using twenty nine, that's for you it's different, but one more But at least i twenty seven. Hemant and we're all using twenty seven, so. Yeah. Yeah. No, but the problem is you're using only digits, so maybe that's how you No, but test set is digits, your m main task is digits k yeah, that's uh like but O_G_I_ numbers are there like now we're little bit convulsed, like we're using twenty seven phones and before it was like twenty four, twenty five. But it's better, like once you have like whatever the back end, then you can put features like whether they're gammas or like spectral entropies or M_F_C_C_s or whatever. Then at least you can see Uh? Yeah yeah yeah. But Aurora is Aurora task. So but Aurora, is it really big database, or I mean how much time it takes to set up system and then It's fast, no? But the problem is Aurora again, these models are word based models, no? Yeah, so again here we use triphones and so but definitely, I d if we want to show noise setting, it's you have to show on Aurora also, like Aurora is real time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah yeah. But yeah Yeah, at least I mean wha those studies I think people already did for even in I_C_ I_C_S_L_P_ two thousand two there is special session on features for Aurora, so yeah, yeah, i yeah yeah. This ICSI features and this uh s uh s uh O_G_I_ features and all this. So there are already people but again like uh, at the end like for L_V_C_S_R_ people are using P_L_P_s or M_F_C_C_s or nothing of these fancy feature Yeah. New But maybe my have a f for publishing another paper or something. Mm. Yeah. But maybe Guillaume, you can tell, no? Like uh you worked i with these Siemens people or no, Siemens or these Daimler Chrystler. What kind of features do you use, like do you use um any you don't yeah, you don't Ah ok okay. Okay. Ah ok Yeah, even s yeah. I didn't discuss anything with Sunil also, like I dunno, technical discussions, anything. these kind of things are a bit, yeah. Yeah, yeah. But do you have any like feeling that whether they go for all these new features or they usually use only mm. Maybe yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. But even they don't believe like with one paper or two I guess, because at least for them no P_L_P_s or M_F_C_C_s, they know that okay, these things work on every task, so okay, we can pu put hands on these things yeah. Huh? Yeah, yeah yeah yeah. Maybe like yeah, f because Sunil is working in Nokia, he's a expert in kind of features or yeah, it l I think. But yeah, we're not sure, even Sunil won't tell us. No, no n no, this uh Cohen, you mean like uh uh Hmm. Oh ok Huh. Uh. But this was signal company, no like? This voice signal company, Hy Hynek always mentions uh Cohen's company with what they're using, you n yeah. Voice no no, voice signal. They make uh recognition for these Samsung phones and yeah. Uh they have like really s many recognisers I guess. Maybe definitely they may be using P_L_P_s or you know. Yeah RASTA or RASTA or something you mean. Mm. Yeah, because mm. Yeah, but again Yeah, too new is really definitely because like want to at least see i at least four, five years of results of some new features and some consistent results or Ah. Uh space or ah, okay. Yeah yeah yeah. Mm. Yeah. But yeah, d Yeah, uh another issue is like again the computational issues, no? If they want to make on mobile, they don't want really use some fancy, really expensive computationally expensive features or all these Yeah yeah, it It's just phone recognition or something like Yeah. But most of the time mobiles, they use D D_T_W_ kind of thing, no like? All these uh so voice calling yeah, voice calling and these thing, because that's easy like, because they don't really need to put lot of uh memory and these things, otherwise if they want to build a real Yeah yeah, yeah. Where where? Mm. Yeah yeah. Yeah, Cohen, yeah, yeah. It's Samsung, some some new really new phone like, mm. Yeah. But uh the software is always available or like No, the software is again on top of mobile, or like it comes with your mobile No, the thing is usually these kind of these kind of facilities are like no not normal, so so they may charge more or like yeah, yeah. Yeah. Ah, ok yeah, definitely they may charge for more money f again, some extra bill for this using this recognition engine or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but maybe like if it can't really recognise you it will be really annoying it's better. Yeah, I have used once like this dragon, that was kind of good like, yeah. Because even in when I was working in uh like in Edinburgh like, one guy, he use i he got some problem with hands and then he was always using this n uh dictation even he used to write lot of C_ plus plus code with the dictation like. It's really good like, so. But you ought to really train and then you're to kind of uh yeah. I get used to the system. Yeah yeah, it's really like you ought to get used to the system, like you how to say all the callings and this thing system how t but it's really funny like, he is able to use it for like like years, I mean he used to write a lot of code and, you know, it's really great. Yeah yeah, you can listen Festival. Read the like Mm yeah. Yeah yeah, Fes yeah, I think I think you can do the Festival, you can just call like uh this there are different kind of again, how you call the Festival, so you can just give the full there is an too. So then you will get the all the caller and other things. If if you want to like read full text, then you can say like the full text, like those syntax and then it will speak till it finishes the text. Yeah, it's real it's yeah. Diphone, yeah, yeah. That's why it's real time, like otherwise it's bit difficult and it's okay, you can easily understand, so it's intelligible, so. Uh Festival is good, like now it comes at all the Linux boxes also, so in so already in this No the there are so many voices, like again Which voice you want to use. No, most of the the Festival, uh what you get on Linux machines, is diphone based only. So they supply few voices. Yeah yeah, yeah, just uh concatenation of the no, it's already there, if you just put li Festival, it comes wi because it's comes with direct Linux software and you know, it is open source. Festival is open It's Yeah, cat voice, like there are like they they have few Yeah, new voices like, yeah. Yeah, that's the difference that tha in views this unit selection. It's not diphones, you have really large inventory of the speech. Uh those voices, they're not yet released. Yeah. No no, it's free, they'll be releasing soon I guess. So maybe you can just check no, i it's it's here on the web, then it won't come with your Linux software, so you have to again download from uh their web page. Yeah, you can download, now. Yeah, yeah yeah. It the voices are called Multisyn, Multisyn uh sl uh that's some voice. So you can download from the voice from the web Festival. Yeah yeah yeah, yeah. Yeah yeah, yeah. So voice is like the database of, the parallel speaker who speaks that this text, so. It was really large database, so it the voi the quality will be better because you can find similar yeah, it's more or less but not exactly like uh it's two times or one point five times or something. But you can prune like how much you want, because so this is again like uh that's kind of my P_H_D_ work how in this system like how you choose the units and how you concatenate. So there are again cost functions and Viterbi. So you can you can always optimise, you can put some thresholds and pruning and then you can make it real time. So then again, compromise uh between the quality and yeah. But still it's good like now. Th you can just check Multisyn and then voices. Uh yeah, yeah, it's really good. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. But only sometimes like it can't really call this yeah. Uh standard text. Yeah. Yeah, ASCII file is ASCII and but only the problem's again acronyms and sometimes it expands, sometimes it may not expand, because it's not in their dictionary, so yeah. It's not in the dictionary, like if we again it's problem like, so. But those things you can add, like if you're really familiar with Festival, so you can add always these Yeah. But at least these things okay like, it won't really make mistakes so often like, sometimes Alan Black and Paul Taylor, they started r Festival in ninety six or something. Edinburgh C_S_T_R_, yeah. Uh f oh uh this ma this Johann Waters or like no, they d what they did Portland O_G_I_, they did L_P_C_ based synthesis. The Festival is alrea already like it's one first you start with th Ah, okay. Mm. From. I don't know. No no, actually the b Ah, okay, okay. Yeah, maybe, because Ah, ok Hmm. Yeah, first they started in C_S_T_R_ with Alan Black and Paul Taylor, then then it expand to many places, because if somebody is fil no, Simon King is he's one of the others, but Rob Clark is the man that you met um. Uh uh, already. Yeah. It's So anything uh more about Lisbon or Interspeech? I it's enough, yeah. Okay.",IN1012
"No. Yep. Uh you can be sitting here itself and do the presentation. Now you need the different method from how from gammas you can generate the posteriors. Okay. Uh I was just um let's talk about little about this presentation itself, the slide number six. Okay, how you feel it is important that you're taking the context of the whole utterance? How important it could be? Is it not a possibility that you're having less context? instead of having context from one to capital D_, which is for the whole utterance, which doesn't make much sense in general. So what is a possibility that you can cut the context instead of having the context from That's right. Might be left or right, everything there, but not the whole context. Because it's it's a fact that when you are having one utterance, so it one utterances link up full sentence or something, and there might not be much breaks in it. So in that sense it doesn't make sense that you are going too much in the past and then you are trying to compute something which is not related. Mm-hmm. Kind of let's say idea is usually hundred milliseconds or one second. Yeah, numbers it might be okay, because most of the sentences might be three seconds or something. Yeah. That m that match of context to computer commas. Mm-hmm. Okay, so when we are talking about them, then my story they are the worst I think. Yeah. I cannot generate posteriors. So there is I don't have the C_ files also presently with me. Yeah. No,. My said that enough is enough. Yeah, and then I then I would have taken two years extension. Yeah, it was it was pretty scary, but let's see what happens. ICSI, mm-hmm. Because even um Petr has lost a lot. He's having only the results with him. He doesn't have the files, the real the real s ones. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, because even to download that much of data Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And then you have to get the L_P_ P_L_P_ features and Okay. Because tho those files are also very big, they are not single files. So there should not be any break. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, P_L_P_ numbers ninety five database is there, fine. Yeah. Everything is lost. And uh if if you really ask me even the structure which was there real every point by point how P_L_P_ is well generated, that information is also not there. Yeah, but the parameters which are exact Hopefully ninety five percent, I know, but that five percent And then we we need to train the new rates because M_L_P_ training needs to be done, and then only the next step will happen. So it's it's pretty pretty hol holding is stupid. Whether we can replicate the results, whatever results you are showing, whether we can replicate them or not. Presently it's it's not known. Yeah. You Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No no no no, he is using different setup I think. He doesn't use our setup. Do you use our setup for the number of states? For the gamma estimation? Okay, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No no, those things I'm also having, because they were done two years back. Anything which is done in the last two years is the one which is Nothing. The there's also in com, com database, yeah. Yeah, that's right. No, th those things are not disturbed. Nothing related to the database has been disturbed. Except the switchboard. No, they're there. No no, it was it was pre-written there. It's in the database itself. That's right, yeah. Yeah, so it that is not a problem. No, I didn't do it myself. No, no, no. Means at l yeah, that part is less uh scary. Yeah. So the things which are related to your P_L_P_ can be done I think, it's it's not such a major problem. So you tha M_L_P_ needs to be trained and uh P_L_P_ features, so it's kind of one and a half days work, kind of, to generate the new files. Yeah, that will aga means it'll light up, that's it. But all all of it is doable in three, four days time. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And if I don't have to generate any new results, I'm also on the other side then. But if I need to generate new results, then and anyway, there is emotional loss, so scripts and code everything written that is No. Yeah, yeah. Because it's Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Means losses are emotional as well as whatever it is there. and bla bla, but it's tragedy. So. So RAID five you have told to the Mm-hmm. No, one disk there is no problem. Mm-hmm, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Was it insured, any idea? No no, insurance can take care of uh means anything can be insured in this world nowadays. Mm-hmm. But it still means one thing which is a mystery to me whe why temp one and temp two were residing on the same hard disk physical. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah, so it means So that Mm-hmm. No no no, what I'm saying means temp one and temp two could have been different systems altogether. I'm saying they could have kept differently. No RAID on both they systems was the problem. Hard disk, there there were already five hard disks, right? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, not everybody is going to be scared of temps. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No no no no no. No no no. I checked over the net, it's not the way. You d you send the things to them, they will see if they can recover. Then only they'll ask you that this is the quotation. But if there is no no if they cannot recover they they will send it back. Mm-hmm. No no no, first they'll give you a quotation. The they won't go we ho without that. It's not means it's a wrong information. Yeah yeah, because in the beginning what they say that send us the thing, we'll look at the things. If it is recoverable, we will tell you what is the quotation, and if it is not recoverable, we will send it back to you. But means f and uh i if they they cannot recover it, then then what they will they won't charge anything from you for the inspection. But That's right. Yeah. Means looking at uh how much failure has happened. Accordingly they will tell you whether they can recover or not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So how much is four tera, four thousand gigabytes? Okay. Not much. Is it raid one has more compared to RAID five? No, RAID one is having exactly f fifty percent capacity is utilised. It's copy. Two copies of the same thing will be existing. That is a RAID one. That's right. RAID five is twenty percent. No. So RAID one is exactly it's means that's lot of wastage of resources, but it's more tolerant. And there is no kind of or anything, nothing exists there. So the disk which has crashed, that cannot be recovered. That uh disk which has not crashed, it can be recovered completely. Means if both the disk have crashed, for the same data, you cannot recover anything. If one disk has crashed crashed, then you can recover everything. Yeah, it'll be in the other disk. So that is RAID one. If you are given a choice, you want to take RAID one or RAID five or a simple laptop. Mm-hmm. To what are the experiments you need to do? What are the new experiments you are having in your mind? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But do you feel that is paper material? But the one which you have reported means you want to report something more than that? Ah, okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. So might be what I can do I can give you the setup and you can you can generate from bottom, train M_L_P_, test M_L_P_. Mm, I was using thirty nine, yes. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So what is this result? This is related to your um M_L_M_I_? Ah, okay, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. What is a triphone gammas? Ah, okay. Your your M_L_P_. Okay. But those gammas will be same as uh s normalised scale likelihoods, right? Then the they're through that data uh from through. Okay. Uh not uh scale likelihoods. Posteriors. From? G_M_M_ oh, M_L_P_ scale likelihoods? You're you are having posteriors there, right? You divided by the. Okay. Okay, so it's scale likelihoods Okay. And full network, what was the r ch architecture? Ah okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So what are the other things we need to discuss? One day after the crash. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's all be because of you. You came on wrong day from Iran. You should had come on, it would have been okay. Anyway. Uh they'll get a shock of their life. Might be the one kind of like if they have read their mails. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, everything is lost, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but it's a major loss, no doubt. The data on which we want to run the scripts is not there. If they can yeah, if they can give me my C_ files, then also it's okay. Yeah, because I don't need to generate features also, yeah. Yeah, it's amazing. I n I don't need all my P_ files, just three of them. Yeah. Nowadays it's not the case. They physically also separate the things. Or it's sprinklers. Then what if their sprinklers don't work? Ah. Uh-huh. Yeah. They won't keep it at one place, yeah. Physically at different places, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. C_D_s are not enough, that's the problem. Because one C_D_ is how much? It's not even one G_B_. So then C_D_s are not enough. Mm-hmm. Hmm. You're talking about datas or you're talking about Okay, mm-hmm. I don't know. No no, he wa he was having locked many things in the proper places. But in temp he wasn't having lot of important things, yeah. All the experiments which he was running. Mm-hmm. Uh look what? But what we'll do with the switches? No no no no no. Okay, that way it might be, but the situation is that uh he he was generating his own P_L_P_ features from his own scripts. He was not using using doctor speech. Yeah. So he was like uh he was so I'd borrowed few of the things from him. The F_F_T_ routine and uh reading the signal wave form. These things I borrowed from him and I changed, and then I put it in my all programmes, so. I I kept the backups, but those backups are the them's also on temp. I didn't I didn't know that this this way it can crash, because I thought maybe I can do a mistake and wipe out the things. And then there is no backup. So I cannot blame anybody, but I didn't know that the whole backup can itself crash. Yeah. So now in in my life I will never believe anything which is temp. Whether it is temperature or whether it is temporary. Because just few few days back I took a backup of my laptop, fearing the same thing. But then I didn't realise that I should take a backup of P_L_P_ is hardly anything, yeah. Ah. From posteriors to s forced alignment. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Three years, two to three years, yeah. Not in all cases, that's the problem which people are facing. Because everything was written then and there itself. Means even if the optimisation has been done, they did the optimisation there and they they worked on that started working on that. They didn't write it with pen or something on a paper or saying that okay, this is the best optimisation. Yeah. Because if I change my configuration and your results are somewhere else. Okay. So how much time we have spent? Okay, so this is good enough. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Have a good day.
Okay. Okay, so should I start? Okay. So I think it's better to first have a presentation of my work and then we can discuss uh with this crash in temp in temp uh what we can do uh for my future to to continue my research, because apparently I I will have serious problems, okay. So I will start with the presentation of my work. Mm. Okay. I start like this then. Okay, so it's uh my g work is generally about uh using posteriors in uh speech recognition systems and uh somehow enhancing the estimation of posteriors, getting new posteriors which are havi which are more informative by somehow integrating some extra knowledge like uh prior knowledge and contextual information related to the problem and then use this posterior estimation uh uh method uh for designing hierarchical uh speech recognition system. So in this hierarchical arg architecture I will be able to uh integrate the extra knowledge at the proper level of hierarchy, and I will be al also uh able to uh combine different kind of uh knowledge or sources uh sources of knowledge I have. Uh well as you know uh generally posteriors are estimated using uh neural networks and more specifically M_L_P_s in a speech recognition system, so uh time limited window of a speech signal is uh represented by some cepstral features, which are then processed by an M_L_P_ and it gives us some evidence as in the form of pos phone posteriors. Then we use these phone posteriors as features or as scores for for either just decoding or d uh uh n d training and inference training and then decoding. Uh but we know that uh in this uh in this case we are not able to integrate contextual information uh uh line contextual information, and we are not able to integrate the prior knowledge we can have about phone use or about uh words in the posterior estimation, so the main motivation is to see if we can integrate this kind of extra knowledge in the posterior estimation. So what is proposed to solve this problem is to use a uh what we formally use in H_M_M_ formalism, which is called gamma uh state posterior. Uh i uh as a posterior for uh training uh or decoding, so it's uh well as you know it's a state posterior probablility in a H_M_M_, which is defined as the probability of being in a specific H_M_M_ state at a specific time, having the whole observation sequence and the model. So whole observation sequence means having complete contextual information and the mod uh and the model can encode some kind of prior knowledge for us by means of uh topological constraints. Uh well you know it's uh this gam uh gamma posterior is written in terms of forward and backward H_M_M_ recursions, and actually one way to use this uh gamma posteriors is uh using these posteriors as some kind of newer scores for decoding. So in this case it will be uh similar to hybrid method. Um the the difference is that we do one more step, uh maybe I can explain it better there. So we do one more step here, and we uh here by means of another H_M_M_ we introduce some kind of uh prior knowledge and contextual information, we get better evidences than what i we initially had here, and then we do the uh decoding and the and s more informative posteriors uh uh instead of this one. So we are expecting to uh the system to perform better and more robust to noisy cases. Here you see uh some results uh and how uh how what is the effect of introducing uh reasonable prior knowledge, so different uh rows in this table are showing different level of noise and also clean speech, and different columns are showing different kind of posteriors or gamma posteriors. So uh the the first column is showing the uh our baseline system, which is getting estimate of posteriors out of M_L_P_ uh and then d using these posteriors for decoding. And the other columns are showing the performance of uh different kind of gamma, so uh gamma which is estimated using uh information about minimum duration of phonemes, about possible transition between phonemes and some kind some uh more prior knowledge like uh which wo like uh which word is composed of which phonemes and uh g uh gram grammatical knowledge ab uh about transition between words and things like this. So as you see, introducing more reasonable prior knowledge um will h help to have better performance in almo in almost all the cases. And here I compare the performance of the gamma base system with the standard H_M_M_ G_M_M_ system, which is based on uh doing decoding uh using uh likelihood as the scores, and the difference is that our system use uh is using posteriors for decoding, so as you see s uh it's working uh better than the standard H_M_M_ G_M_M_ system. And finally the conclusion is uh he here we saw how we can get uh some more informative posteriors by introducing extra knowledge like prior and contextual information, and then using this uh uh p posterior estimation method to design hierarchical uh speech recognition system which we're which which the goal is to have a better, more efficient and more robust system. So if you want now we can discuss about um uh the crash and the loss of data, so uh well I lost all the posteriors I was I uh I used as input uh for my system, so the gamma are somehow estimated or computed on top of posteriors. And now I don't have any posterior and uh probably the scripts generating that posterior, so what I can do okay. Okay. Okay. Gamma full model, but uh what about other ones and what about the f posterior, because because I I uh you know, I cannot uh stop my resea I I may do something else, you know, in future with this uh and well I need posteriors to Yeah. Uh no no, I don't have them there were all under temp. You you we have that because you uh stored them. So. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe maybe some other m uh P_H_D_ student should be hired to work on, you know, the generating gamma. Six, okay. Less context, what you mean? Uh Yes. Yeah. You mean a smaller context instead of this. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, b well, even they can have some information which are not so meaningful or uh which are not related. Yeah well, but then I will have the problem to find the optimum amount of context. How much context should I take? Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's a good idea. That's reasonable. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. And and you don't have uh scripts for Ah, okay, you do you have just your, no? And what could happen if you don't even have your? Mm. Yes. N yeah, I uh for C_T_S_ Petr uh still I think have he didn't uh lose anything, so. Ah. Okay. Mm. Mm just uh po uh pi uh posterior estimated using P_L_P_ features for number, which I think we can we can rate it. Uh P_L_P_, they're also last. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yes. Uh nowadays not that one. There is another problem for uh verifying these results, because well for these results, you know, the the configuration should not well I also saved the configuration somewhere in the temp, so exactly how many stays for decoding and which kind of language model and things like this. I I think I can remember almost all of them, but f it's it's a bit uh uh stressful. Yeah, but h he doesn't. Uh y m yes. Lost. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, so so as the conclusion there is no major problem except regenera yeah, which time for, I guess. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Well, I also had the of generated posteriors or gammas or things like this, which I should regenerate, I have the uh scripts but uh well it takes time, it's C_P_U_ and regenerating all these things, but okay, it's okay. So there is no major problem except time. Deadline of two weeks for ICAS. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. T Ah. Well I I think w after this meeting we can t we can try together to regenerate this. Well uh P_L_P_s I think th they should be first regenerated, then posteriors, and if by the end of week we could have posteriors, then it's not that difficult, I can easily regenerate the gammas and do all the experiments again. Maybe it's a Uh mainly th there would be some experiment to check how the system is robust against these uh tuning factors like uh language mod uh language modelling, scaling factor language scaling factor and inversion penalty. This will be the main new issue, and uh well Yeah, the new thing in the paper, and well, some No in these cases, but Well actually actually this w this was not in the paper. I put it in the presentation, but it's not in the paper. Uh the paper was just for clean speech, but since I had the results before and I cannot copy these things, because I t uh I talked with Herve and he said okay, actually the numbers are not uh very reasonable because they are just thirteen P_L_P_ features and uh we have to have at least something which is known for people. I mean they are expecting something around ninety, eighty seven or uh something like this. Uh so I anyway, I had to re to redo all the experiments, but now it's a little bit more difficult, because before I had posteriors and now we have two more steps, P_L_P_s and and and posteriors, so. Yes, thank you very much. Thank you very much uh. Oh m I wanted I wanted to extend this uh well actually, the paper we wanted to write was uh for ICAS was something related to multi-stream gamma. But okay, okay. Uh will I I will explain. So tha my plan was to have two streams, and I I I well. Yeah. I so I I thought that okay I one stream will be P_L_P_ and the other will be delta P_L_P_s. So this was one part of experiment, so single stream, and then I wanted to combine deltas with this and have another table, so that was why. But actually because, you know, the numbers and the study is not sh i it's not showing uh strong results. Anyway, results are not very important, but they should be within a range of uh acceptable numbers. So then uh for now I think it's better to instead of doing P_L_P_ and delta P_L_P_, I can uh have single stream of thirty nine P_L_P_s, and then combine them with traps, just to have Yeah, thirty nine. Yeah yeah, yeah yeah. No no, it's Interspeech. The okay. These numbers are full P_L_P_ thirty nine, okay? But just to make things clear in the presentation, to show more steps Try yeah. Yeah, yeah. Even Even if you No Th Yeah. It's amazing that everything was under temp. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Sileye will be back and he's not in vacation, but he's in Italy. He flies to Senegal directly. Mm. Mm. And what if we have some day a fire in IDIAP, we will lose all the data. Mm I mean, but they have well I I think w they can and yeah, they can d you know, store it somewhere. But you know, here we can easily have a fire, because the everything is made of wood I think and it's small and Anyway, the good the conclusion is to have a back-up and uh and C_D_ at home. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Reverse. Okay. Thank you, thank you. You too.
A lapel is also there. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's better. Uh you go to the table, you have there like the big table, you told and then we can discuss. So which I think I have all the gammas, no? Especially gamma full models I have. Yeah, posteriors And posteriors. Even you have those three state perform gammas also, you have all these Huh. Ah okay. So now yeah, now you can write another paper if you can Gammas to posterior. I two hundred. Two hundred millisecond. So but for numbers I think it may be okay, numbers hardly yeah. one two. Even less than that, yeah. Just few words, like so but if for or something, like if it's really long sentence of ten seconds or something, you may not really need so much con I know, it's really computationally very intensive also, like if you use So pretty much all the posteriors are from you only. Sk Oh, you know. But al for your case you don't need really complicated posterior, you just need some P_L_P_s and then. No, but but ma he's he may be linking to Matthew I guess, because Matthew got the wav files. But you got the all the wav files, so. Yeah, so that's what I'm saying, like Uh yeah. Yeah, yeah. So if he got features then it's okay, otherwise if he has to generate again, he can't generate. Yeah. So Because Yeah. But the p everybody has features in temp, only most of the time all the C_T_S_ features or C_T_S_ wav files, so. So forget about C_T_S_, at least now I think because it's again It takes at least one or two weeks. But segmentation. But you say do you need to do some segmentation also, on top of that, so. They're Yeah, the we can wait at least one or two weeks for this, because it's But still, I think we can't really do these things before ICAS because yeah. So maybe we can concentrate work especially on numbers now and then we can go to C_T_S_. So in numbers case, what do you really need like? Yeah, basically yeah, w we need to generate again P_L_P_s, but wave files are there. Yeah, P_L_P_s But you're generating P_L_P_s from? Um Mm. But at least you f Yeah. Yeah, that you can del But at least, yeah, you have something to verify their wa. So so P_L_P_s or these are all thirteen just only P_L_P_s, not deltas and del Yeah. But if you got something from Hemant or Matthew then I have those number of stage, like we have then you know like it's only for only close uh D_C_L_, K_C_L_ they have. No, he he got from you only. Ah. I think so, yeah, so then I have those number of stages. Yeah. Ah, okay. So Ah. So you didn't have any P_ for these P_L_P_s, no P_L_P_s or P_ files from P_L_P_. So bu what about this noise levels, like we have noise wav files in da da COM databases. So we have directly f wave files with uh particular noise. Ah ok see No, but but I think uh de But Hmm. But the problem is like all this I think it may not be there in database, I guess. Oh, okay. You called the noise X_ database. Ah, okay. Even with uh S_ and R_s. Ah, okay, then it's okay. Ah. So y you it's not that you all the no. Yeah with S_ and R_, different S_ and R_s. Yeah, so at least we have wave files, so now we can generate anything in the P_L_P_s or so at least Yeah. Those But for all these S_ and R_s, so that's also again Hmm. No, the thing is like you can't really write this k I suppose uh the code is the real problem, scripts is okay like, yeah. Even scripts also the configurations or you do if you forget something, some factor or something, it's really Which disk? Uh three disk. Mm-hmm. So it should be replaced by Ah, ok Mm-hmm. Yeah, Hmm. It will ri Uh it will have measures like Uh. Hmm, but like this. But even this maybe really huge data also. I think maybe some companies definitely do insure you can't really have so many backups Which just partition these uh. Hmm. But Yeah. But uh we we Hmm. Yeah, no temp. Uh so then then Hmm. But is it really costly, the system is Hmm. Maybe at least they will give some number others, like they can. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, at least they they will know m beforehand I think uh. Yeah, yeah. Mm but even like how much important data l sometimes it's just M_P_ threes or something, so you don't really need to Fo four tera, no? Four tera, it's like Mm-hmm. Yeah, four thousand gigabytes. Yeah, it but now we got something like uh more than fift No, RAID five is better, I think. It l it levels. Uh ah, okay. Mm-hmm. But RAID five is then then twenty percent copy only. Ah,. It's not the other way. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it will be then the other disk. Yeah. Yeah. Again. scaling. And also maybe like this noise is he was Mm, this is not in the paper actually d This is Hmm. Yeah. At least now he can know a full system setup from Yeah. So now mainly like uh thirty nine P_L_P_. You were always thirty nine, no? Not sure But then why did this features you gave me like they're thirteen? You truncated them to No no no no, these these these ones like the Ah, okay. Hmm. Ah. Ah, okay. deltas. Ah, okay. Ah, ok Hmm. Yeah, those results only you reported in Interspeech, no, like uh thirty nine P_L_P_ results. Uh. Uh they were, but they were less than ten percent or so. Now, even the clean speech you are getting No no, this is just Uh n no he gave scale to me, then I generated gammas. Even uh No no no no. The they're differently. Yeah. Yeah, because I have triphone G_M_ G_M_M_s and H_M_M_s. So he gave me scale likelihoods of triphones. Scale likelihood. Scale likelihoods. From triphone memory. Hmm. So then again I will pass through full network. Then I can generate triphone gammas. It's like. It's no no, it's uh it's just G_M_M_ word models. You have all the connections to between all the words, like hmm. So then first thing is like we need to generate P_L_P_s, and then all these S_ and R_s P_L_P_s. Hmm. No, it was there on uh like uh yesterday morning also like even. So I was running some experiments and then it was okay, but it's readable only, so I can't write anything, so. Yeah, so but we don't know, like we thought like I thought it's recovering, so maybe by tomorrow I'll get everything, so. Uh so if you want a copy again, you'll have But yeah, still some people are in vacation, so they will really Pedro Pedro also Hmm. But even all over the recent iteration, iterate training set in temp. Because like we we s how much we can copy, because it's really so many iterations and even we thought of really completing minimal experiment also mm. But at least, yeah, a script are there every scripts, like at least scripts are there but so if if they can decode Yeah, if they can decode at least Hemant's P_ files then Hemant can Yeah. But C_ files yeah. Even if they give you P_ files, it's really better, even you don't really need to ru run all the Yeah yeah, you j just only like recent P_ files at least. No no no. Yeah. But still I think I it depends. Uh in Edinburgh they had that big fire and then Even even sa several uh da buildings and all the computers in that building they all burned, but they have like three backups in the university, so all these people, they didn't really affect much. No, it's the university is maybe it's really big, so they can afford for Yeah, they yeah yeah, they want th they'll have backup in different and also in in some in underground, so that like file proof or something, yeah. Yeah, maybe. No, C_D_s are not enough like, no. Yeah, how much uh Hmm. Hmm. But what about home directories or he also kept everything in uh temp. Yeah. But he he did mostly on numbers, no? So at least if we can recover we we can read some of his stuff or something. Did you locate it? It is home or home speech or something. Look for any features or anything are there. No no, he he maybe he might be using same P_L_P_ features or something, it they are different. We don't know it. Uh his own Ah okay, is here, he got uh his own Yeah. Uh Hey. Hmm. Oh then it's good, you know like we don't really nee So but your P_L_P_ is also like Mm-hmm. Then we just need to run your neural net only yeah, but P_ P_ P_L_P_s are like hardly few minutes li Mm. Which which scripts? And then But but you still need to run all the nets no l? It's No, but it's it's not I think at least it takes two hours or three hours I think. you can't parallel also, that's the problem. He Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So for example if he want repeated all these results, then he ju he need to use all ma Hemant's P_L_P_ configuration then that's really Yeah, the results will be Then you don't you don't know uh uh well. Yeah, for thirty five, forty minutes it is. Uh uh thank you. It's all?
Yeah. Yeah, you can go back up to the feature, you know. Up to Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you can then you know, because if most did it on, what, numbers and one of couple of C_T_F_ experiments, right? No no no, no no, I uh probably might Uh. Yeah, but the wave file is th that's in the temp only, right? So so the only thing is that I can recover it back from Berkeley No, everything we w if th if they say that we cannot recover it, then I can quickly get it back from ICSI in a couple of days. I can put all the system back here. But uh Mm yeah. Yeah, a lot of time no, it I can dow obviously downloading is another thing. The only thing is that I have to do is that they have uh data in uh one particular structure, so I have to first of all, you know, organise create tar files, and then I can get it back here. Yeah, that I can get all those things. All th all those m yeah. Yeah, but the those files can be recovered easily, only thing is that uh now if they had to say that we cannot recover it. Uh uh one uh one uh day one o one, two days, like this week I can wait and see. If they cannot recover it, then I can just get all the data from ICSI and put back the C_T_S_ system. No, we cannot do. Yeah. Everything that. One one. No, no, but they're they're they're down in the database section. Yeah, except switchboard but the switchboard also we have it, but only thing is that we don't have all the data we need, yeah. No no, it is dead. Because it was that now No no, it w o ori originally done. No no, it is even in D_V_D_ form we have it, that the No, except uh except time. How much time we want to spend again to get Yeah, it's Mm. Mm-hmm. They are they're it's it's it looks like if you get three disk gone, then it's very difficult to get it well like fine if it's one disk it's fine because at least one is having the uh mirror mirror, so it will recache on the mirror. Um but uh if the three disk are gone it's very difficult. So I don't know how it went, like usually while as soon as one disk fails, it should be replaced actually and uh I dunno. Mayb yeah, otherwise it uh it'll go on destroying other disks. So i so the one so they I don't know how it happen, you know, such a thing like usually as soon as one fails, it actually notifies the, you know, the system administrator or makes certain kind of um noise. Uh yeah, to to make sure that, you know, it has to be replaced. So w uh if it the disk is not replaced, then it w it'll fail. It uh then then it uh there's a internal recovery if it just r replace the disk there. It's it it can internally it can quickly recover everything into that disk. Uh so so it's like, you know, if you have a mm mm uh um if you have It's kind of like essentially if it is like hundred twenty, hundred hundred G_B_ data space, then it essentially will have a hun two hundred G_B_ only stu visible data f to you. But then it can we as soon as they replace one of those hard disk i it can it can from the other one it can recover everything on that. Inter internally it can do that kind of thing, but if the th if the three disks fail, then it's it's it's yeah, a really difficult job, I don't know how it can be recovered. Probably the mm one way that they extend the har the hard disk to the people who are experts, and they do like sector by sector, block by block they try to recover. But that's it's very expensive. Uh th simple, yes, the simple thing might cost you minimum ten thousand Euros, fifteen, something like that. I don't know whether it was insured. I don't think insurance company will give Mm-hmm. No, it does, because it was not temp one temp two, but they have the same mm it has three G_B_ three disks, hard disk category. And so you can go up to fourteen or something like that, but it can be on the same yeah. But so it tries to put if you it tries to uh quickly put things uh if this way that so that and but only thing that only one has the mm um backup, keep taking up the backup there. So it puts everything mm quickly, it can decide wherever it wants to put, so it's faster to do that way. Mm. No, I think that uh soft name they were given the Yeah. But then what are the use of raid then? No, but that is what the raid can allow you to have keep up to fourteen hard disk. It can allow. Yeah, so it they have five, and you can go up to fourteen if you want to keep there. And it can still work, and it takes the and the way it look like it it's still tolerant, you know. The way it it usually it does it if you one this crashes before uh i uh um if it uh replace quickly, then no problems. Otherwise unsaved data will start the first thing is to get lo lost. Mm that's the thing. I um Temp is no well, it's a I think they can they can they can do, because th th some some of these people that expert there are couple of experts, so they learned itself. So. If they can easily recover it, well To do this kind of thing, you know. Yeah, it depends on the job. You know, sometimes the small hardware thing, they might do it to then, you know, five thousand Euros and all. But if it's very much detailed work, they will just i it the system the the whole thing starts like this that you have to give your credit card number and sign a form and then only they will start touching your hard disk. Yeah. No no, bu no, th they will No no, that's what they say, like you do it, then send it the hard disk, then they will say okay, we can do it, and then if you do it with only with only yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Then what did they estimate of that? Yeah. I think that is yeah. No, it it is up to, you know And in fact if they they can go a lot, but you know, they can go block by block and look into it and try to recover, but um that Matthew will want to go or not is the question. Yeah. And it's like forty tera. Four tera that's forty tera. Yeah. Four thousand G_B_s. Yeah, that's a that's a big Mm um Yeah uh. Mm yeah, it's a. And Hemant how uh how do you want to go about it? Mm. No, I will say how do you like to go about with ICAS? Mm. You did it on only one. And they were then. Yeah. He use the triphone M_L_P_ and get uh No,. No, I I gave yeah. Yeah, it yeah. No no. Uh yeah, scale like uh scale likelihoo from uh t uh M_L_P_ Yeah, well yeah, so I j I d do I did try it yeah, th that's how you do that. No, but I think what I think there is still some data which is recoverable. At least they could give us time to I think that uh the most of those things should be there. I can hope it already if they could No, you don't have to write, but you could read, no. Yeah. So Daniel is well in Italy? Yeah. Oh, that is fire will lose all the data, you know. Physically, uh yeah. Yeah, physically it is updated. No, I think there is sprinkler or something around here, I hope so. Yeah, in fact they distributed the whole thing around. They may not have it in one place. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, something like that I can recover. No, but For example f phonebook I can recover everything on phonebook, because I have it on the C_D_. I wrote it once time to copy it to my home, and so I have all the data of my C_D_. But I don't know if I had I copied all the numbers that are on that, so. Data itself. The whole feature to everything. Features, segmentation, every label file, everything is there. I could recover it back from there actually, but temp. No. No, i uh Not Only good thing is that the numbers I think I pretty much can recover all the even the f triphone experiments. Because I think I have kept those labels, all those things in the speech directory. A P_ file of it. So it's easier to it all back, all those labels and everything, yeah. P_L_P_ should be there. I re should have kept the P_L_P_ also somewhere tha N mm, the the extra work on is like, you know, converting the segmentations from monophone to triphone, this kind of thing. Then the all the scripts are there in the temp file, that kind of thing. I uh like no no no no, no. No, what you do is like you have the segmentation to train that for monophones, right? You can uh you can convert the same thing into triphone segmentation, because there is monophone and triphone, they are not different, except that you're just going to give a different label to them p depending on the context. So it's easier to convert that segmentation directly here rather than now ugh you know, you say the point that if you lose one uh so uh so the thing is that I have to recover means I have to recover through the pho no monophone segment segmentation to triphone segmentation, the whole thing. Yeah, it's okay. Th that uh numbers it's very fast, so it's no problem. Yeah, so it's yeah. Yeah, but right now you the thing is that right now you know almost what is the uh like the which will give you the best is also you can cont instead of running it hmm. Yeah. Anyway mm let's recover it. Ho let's hope the best. I think I think we have spent Uh yeah. Okay. Fine. Okay, fine. It's all, we have to leave fast.",IN1002
"Did we get seven out of ten for the other one? Okay. Yep. Not bad. Um I think there is. Just because um the the topic box and all this is um is based on um, oh what's it called, nom no, NITE text area or something. In text area, is that what it is? Um it has some sort of highlighting stuff there. So you should probably look at the Um I'm not sure if it's in-built though, to be honest. What what what wh wh You don't. Okay, I'll do it. Yeah, I w I was thinking about uh I was going that direction anyway. Yeah, that Okay, yeah. So Okay, yeah, I see what you mean. I think. I think. So um I uh have you already calculated all this data or are you supposed to do that? Oh right. Alright. Uh what should it come back as? Numbers. Oh, yeah. Um whatever you give me I can do it, I think. I mean um Um Um so what will whenever we open a window for one speaker um Yeah, yeah. Sh pretty much, I would have thought. Yep. Yep. Definitely. Oh is it? Um the one present. Although we could do th mm we could do the one highlighted I suppose. Mm. Mm-hmm. I mean that would um that would be um implementing what you said, that you wanna see, per topic you wanna see which one spoken most, something like that. So you could you could zap through these topics uh meetings, sorry. And um and it would come up with how much they spoke and you can pick the one that s looks the most interesting. So do you wanna do that then? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. So yeah, random things like just like return talking time. Or Yeah. Good. Yeah, I mean Can you put in there what topic was spoken about as well? Then I could use that for the for the topic pop up window. That'd be r That wasn't what?. Yeah. Yeah. Because at the moment if you right-click on a topic window on one of the topics, you have the option of pop popping open a window which gives you a list of all the meetings containing that topic. So Yeah. Yep. So how how would you d how would you calculate that? Would you do the summarisation as you populate it? You know, just yeah, for the global Oh right, so oh, so that that is all sta stored together. Oh right, okay. Okay. Sounds good. So have you done these yet, the no. Mm just gotta decide on what we wanna Um Yeah, definitely. Yeah. So it's all all usable now, can I do it tonight? Hmm. Oh, I see. Yeah. Well, let me know when when it's sort of usable. Or at least What do you mean, a picture? Do you mean just the yeah, but it's not gonna take very long. I mean it's m yeah. Mm. Hmm. Sounds good. So where is that? Is that stored in the uh On your home directory, not in the okay. Yeah. Sounds good. Alright. Yeah. Well, are you wanting to write that in directly or what what do you wanna do with that? If you wanna change my code. You're yeah, but are you do you wanna change that m the original M_ browser file then? Or yeah. Have you done that now? Or Oh, okay, so not the actual one but a copy of it. Okay, yeah. No, I just Well just just tell me when, because I usually I usually work on my own copy for for the day and then update it without checking if th if the one in the one in the shared one has changed. So Okay. Yeah, let me know. Yeah. Cool. So is that what you're working on now then, to in to rip to present the results nice overall? You mean the hi highlighting stuff? Or Yeah. Actually for um um for an N_ text area, whatever it is, um they they defined some ha handy highlights on that. So you've got different different highlights. You've got just look at the the what they wrote about it. They've got like user highlights, um selection highlights, time highlights and something else. So you can quite easily if your text area is called area, you just do area dot set highlights or something, you know. Something like that. That's the way I did it to to highlight, to cross-highlight between topic and then transcripts. Sorta thing. Really? Really? Oh yeah, allocates more dat more room or whatever. More memory. Does it talk to you now, does it? Yeah. Spent too much time in front of it, I think. Mm. Right, well I've been uh I've been doing some random pop-up windows for the speaker characterisation, which is good. So I can feel that in now. The windows are all there now after lots of fiddling. Well, you know, just the pop uh pop-up window was difficult enough. Because um it it m basically has to set up um like whatever ten pop-up windows in memory, as in already initialize them, because there's there might be ten speakers that all have to have different mee windows and Um and I'm working on when you click on a topic to see a list of the of the topics of of of the meetings that that topic was mentioned in. And I have uh a question about the we said we wanted a start screen. What kind of start screen do we want? I mean do we want some general blurb about welcome to the browser or something? Some animation dancing on. Yeah. So do we want yeah, maybe we could write an on like the whatever it's called, the the top of the window saying welcome to the meeting browser.. Yeah, but how? M I mean at the moment the way it is it's uh it's a drop down menu, as you've seen, um with all the and that because it's it's the dialogue class that you use there. Yeah. I mean I think they should have two options, either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search. And through that, once you've got the results, you click on something and that loads up the first Oh. Does it? Oh. Oh ju just bec mm. Oh. Can you not get this nom object um I suppose we wouldn't wanna use yeah, we yeah, we wouldn't wanna use N_X_T_ at the beginning anyway, because we don't wanna search um locally, we wanna search globally. So d so let's say Well no, then they would open the meeting first, right? So let's say they have two options, either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like. Yeah. No, but why do we want default? I mean just you know. Yeah, but local search. We can't do global search without anything. Pretty much. Yeah, I mean the local Yeah. But yeah, the the global um inverted file search gives the nom objects basically to the local search, right? Well yeah, th that's always gonna be the case with search. Mm. I mean you can uh you know, the option is to do a search in the way that you d if you do a global search, first as a first step, and you return the meetings, as in they're not even the meetings but the name of the meetings, so you know, say you wanna search for the word language, then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language. And then you can decide well I wanna search on this and this and this meeting, or only on this meeting, or Yeah. Definitely, yeah. There is um yeah, in the in in one of the papers they have m um names, such as um better understanding or whatever. Even w one of them is yeah, one of them is even even better understanding or something. I I love that. Yeah. I love that. Yeah. Yep. So I've yeah, I've put that in already to Sort of. So yeah, again concretely to the start-up start-up um libraries window. Um Well, can I Yeah, how is that? I mean do you think you would have have time for that as well? Wha what does T_F_I_D_F_ stand for? Oh. Okay. Yeah. Ah. So the general score, would that be a um for the whole of the language or the for all the whole of the corpus? Okay. Okay. Well, you know, you can you might have some general frequencies. Oh, I see. So what would the if we had the these fake topics, what what would the what would they look like? A bunch. Just a list of like three words or something.. Alright. Because that would be really handy then, we can actually test it on the user, as opposed to just doing it and not using it. 'Cause if you just have the segmentation, that's great, but we can't we can't compare it to the to the uh hand annotated, you know, the hand segmented tool. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Yeah, that would work. That'd be really nice. Mm, yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too, yeah. Well, do we want to? Do we want to? Sort of, but then the main idea was more like to to speed it up, speed the search up, because N_X_T_ over the over the whole of the corpus was just not feasible. But it would be No, but the general inverted file. Oh, yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. That would just be a nice extra. Yeah, I I wasn't sure if it was or not. True. It's true. So what, it's only interim. Yeah, I mean if you have time. Do that as well, that'd be really nice, yeah. 'Cause I mean then then it would give you like if you searched for a word, it would give you the the meetings, but also how often the w that word occurred in that meeting. That would be so useful. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but it would be useful if you yeah. You know, you c if you have a if if you search for language and you return like, you know, basically all of the meetings, you wanna see where they actually spoke about it and where they just mentioned it once. Ah. Language and No, just like Edinburgh and language. alright. And then and then ad add those up or something. Or what? How would you combine them, that's the question. So to come back to the start-up screen I'm I'm I'm I'm very unsure about what that should look like. I mean we wanna for the part where you can choose choose the the meeting, what kind of information do you wanna have about the meeting? I mean the u the the longer name obviously, if there is one, 'cause they don't all have a longer name. What the users that spoke. The users that took part. But then that's probably pretty much the same for the same group. Yeah, I'm not sure. Yeah, just to give them an idea, general idea what there is and so they can pick a a to um a meeting. Yeah. Yeah, or w you kn yeah. I wanna look at the meeting where so-and-so spoke um of that, you know, sort of some sort of research group. I want that first meeting. Look at that. Oh. Oh. Mm I don't think we need that, yeah. Because we we just wanna have a way of of yeah. Because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting, y they can they can browse through that quite nicely. Yeah. What do you mean? W how how are we gonna know that? Have a user model. But that would defy the whole point of browsing, right? If you only wanted to look at like five meetings. Well you just you just uh you just scroll down the list and find your favourite one. I mean It's not like they come back every day and do the same browsing. Let's see what's changed today. Mm. Yeah, yep. Oh right, oh okay. Well Yeah. No, that's Um I w I wasn't gonna put any, you know, any any help in there any sort of a explanation of how the browser works, to be honest. I wasn't oh right. Mm-hmm. I see. But I mean the main thing what you wanna do is to view a meeting, right? Yeah, or search, yeah. S and both of those we have and Yeah, that uh all happens for the search basically. Basically, either the user wa knows which meeting he wants to look at and he just clicks on it, or he doesn't and then he searches for one that sort of looks like Yeah. Oh, I see what you mean. Inside the search menu, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's that's what yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that looks about right. Um but I'm I'm unsure about how to how to put all the information in there. Because we need drop-down menu, but we want all the information about the name, the longer name, and the sp and the users. So how d how d No, but the codes I mean at least maybe if they know the codes and in or the to in or the corpus corpi? Yeah. Drop-down is definitely not Yep, yep. Yeah. But then yeah, as I said, how do you do it? Um No no no, I'm not I'm not saying you can you can pick a user, but you should come up with some list, but an extended list of the of the meetings, so you know, you have B_D_R_, whatever it was called, O_ one. And then it gives you the longer name, blah, and then it gives you the, you know, the participants. I was thinking that. Yeah. Tool tip. But then yeah. Uh no, it's not at all, I think. A tool tip, yeah. I've not tried that yet, but I was I was gonna do that. I'm very yeah, very keen on that, yeah. Yeah, I'm not sure what th it is that very is that not annoying if you have to hold your m you know, you ha you have t yeah, y yes. They do that a lot, don't they? No, but you know, to to search for a u pecif pec specific user, you have to hold your mouse over that one, wait for it to pop up, hold your mouse on that one, wait for the pop Um Hmm. Mm. Yeah. It'd just be nice to have some basic information on on each of the meetings. Yeah, I'm thinking that that updates depending on what you've got highlighted. Yeah, maybe that's the best idea then. So you've got a drop-down menu, a search a search button not search, go button. And then Some sort of field which updates dynamically depending on what you've got highlighted. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good. I think. Nom. Yeah. What does nom actually stand for? NITE, oh yes. Oh. Oh, yeah. You've got lots of nom something and then NITE something and then N_ something. Oh really? Oh. Oh. No. In most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying you've gotta update this, Jonathan. This is this is uni unintelligible. Great. I know it is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yep definitely. Not very fun. Right, so anyone else got anything to say? Do we yeah, do we want another meeting at the end of the week um with Pernilla? Yeah. Yeah, something like that. I mean uh I think I'm gonna do quite a bit of work this week, so I'll have probably more to talk about. I think yeah. Well If you like. Well, we can disc uh discuss that on Friday if we have one. Friday? What what time? Um I've got a doctor's appointment at ten to two. What? Li W how about qui I can't. Um what I oh, no no, that that would only give us like thirty five minutes or something. Well what how about quite late? Like you know, five or six. Well three o'clock, let's say three o'clock for now. Okay. Right. I'll write um I'll write this meeting up and I'll send it to Pernilla as well. No. Because she's not here. I collect meeting summaries. Yeah, no, we should probably do that at end, depending on So can we just can we just r repeat briefly what we've spoken about. So we've din done uh progress on the speaker characterisation, who does the speaker characterisation. We've mentioned topic labelling with uh key-words. Um we discussed if the search should be ranked. And Michael, did you have anything else? And a start-up window. Oh well, basically not not unless you've got time for at the end. It would be nice at the end. I think it would. Yeah. I think I think it w it would it would give you the most relevant result. No, but for things like if you search for language, then you might have you have some topics which have as a, you know n some some meetings which have as a topic language, they specifically speak about language, and they use that word like in every sentence. And then you've got those that just mention, you know, mention it briefly, like once or twice saying, you know, my language is German or something stupid that you don't really want. So you wanna distinguish those somehow. Or would be nice anyway. Yeah, yeah. Uh for multiple terms we can just do something really simple. I mean Yeah. Yeah, just just just disregard it, yeah. Yeah, I mean you'd you'd just do it really simply, you know. You'll have the results as before, but yeah, yeah. Can discuss it on Friday. It doesn't have to be all intelligent. Yeah, exactly. Mm. Well it's not that many meetings. So that sh that shouldn't is there really? Wow. Ooh. Hmm yeah, that's true. It would be useful as well for a word like language that might occur in all of them. But you wanna find the one that actually contains it usefully somehow. You know, you still wanna be able to search for for the word language. In a sensible way. Well we'll discuss it again on Friday. Yep. Yep. Tick.
Oops. Does it squeeze in, aye, like that? Yeah. Okay. Right. Yep. It's going uh. Okay. Sure. just said the same things you just said.. So how we're getting along? T uh I wanted to talk about that actually. Um this speaker, um the data processing is fine, but uh we don't particularly want to do the b the the b the GUI for it. No, not really. If someo if you wanna do that, then then tell me how you want the data presented, how the 'cause Do you want me to tell you? Okay, like, 'cause at the moment, the the the there is I've created two classes, one that represents speakers, one that represents the meetings, and the meet and the information about both is contained within each object. So and then they wr it writes objects and the objects contain all the information about the meetings and the speakers. So that the who the speakers that are at the meetings and the amount they speak, and then the averages are contained with the speakers. So there's two separate class, aren't there. And they all they're two different objects, and you can recall they can write the it writes the objects and then you call the objects back and they ha those returned objects have all the information that they need, and then you can call methods to return whatever you want. Or everything, but that's why I wanted to know how ho what's the easiest way to have the data. Yeah, supposedly all calculated, yeah. Um and all stored as objects, so dot object files. Um which means that you just ret call constructor and call the load thing and call it there and you can create a list of them or a vector of them or whatever you wanna do, yeah. And then or just call them one at a time to populate window. But that's what I wanted to how y how what format do you want the data to come back in. 'Cause it can come back as a almost anything. What's easiest to display on the screen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, ca you could Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So um so I can have it so that it returns you a 'cause at the moment the main data structures are hash tables for the meetings that say it's got one that says percent it's called percent talk. One's percent noise and one is percent participation. Do you see what I mean? So and then it's got inside it's got a link for it's got a it's got the n speaker's name, and then it's got their percentage for that thing. So it can either come back as a you can have the hash table or you can have it returned as a vector, and it will say noise. Uh just a string is noise w X_ percent. It will say vector this cou I don't know, whatever. W you can either have it th you could either have it you could i have it like an embedded in vector or array of strings and each one represents one person or whatever. What the what the easiest thing dec how how you wanna display it. Okay. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. See that's the ca How did we Can I have a look at that again? Okay. S If it's in that format, it's speaker. It's speaker speaker is the uh controlling thing, not yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So all of this uh all that's calculated as well, stored as speaker objects. Yeah, that's that's easy. Some are quite amusing actually. The uh the influences of I lived in Germany for six months, don't know if that had any effect. Just spend too much time talking to Brits. That was bizarre thing., where did these people come from. So then the all that's calculated as well. All I have to do is get the dialogue acts. I don't think that'll be difficult. Um So then does this how does is how is this box populated? Is it populated by the one present or the one highlighted? The one present, okay. 'Cause at the moment I'm using there is there are methods that say um for the using, for other talks. So that's and it says like get get talk time, and you and y it takes a name, so that w could call that would call that and call the meetings method that said return that, and that would populate that, which should be an easy thing to do. Um and the same for that, comes out there. Meetings. Yeah, yeah. Yep. Yeah yeah, that would be easy as well, yeah. Yeah, okay. So I'll w I'll just leave in lots of methods that st that'll just return one number at a time. That'll be the easiest way to do, yeah. Okay, yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Get talk time I think it's called at the moment, something like that, yeah. No, it's stored as an object file. It processes a whole lot off-line and stores it as an object, and then they're much much smaller. They're only like a one um one thou one K_. Yeah, it's all pre-processed. And then it's just each method object's got a return bunch of return methods. You have to g re-create the object. It's got a load method. So what you do is you call a null constructor, 'cause if you call the th proper constructor for each meeting, it goes off and does all the processing and stores own object. And then um if you call a null constructor, then you pr call load and you can call load and whatever one or all of them or anything like that. Go through a list. Yeah. One object for each meeting. Yeah. Although yeah, yeah. Although you c Yeah. It's just tell it tells you who participated. At the moment it tells you who participated and the amount they participated in percentages, and in time as well. Yeah yeah, that'll be pro that'd be easy, yeah. Yeah, if that won't be too difficult. But that would be that would cause a problem with anything that wasn't annotated for topics. Oh yeah. No, topic specified, yeah have a default, yeah. There are some there are some default actually. The um a lot of people don't get their own ch and other stuff. But Yeah. Okay. Right. Y oh yeah, that wouldn't be a problem. And then you could do a search over the meetings over the objects. 'Cause that's the thing, these these are so small, they can load each o all of the whole lot up and do a search of the whole lot to find who by who and what problem or what topics were in what. So it doesn't crash the thing. What the global statistics come straight off of that, don't they. 'Cause they're just for the meter met th the The speaker class knows about all of that stuff, and the meeting class knows about that stuff. Um No no, but I don't think that'll be too difficult. What we want, yeah. I thought the other stuff was more important anyway, so I did that first. Mm no, design the GUI first, and uh 'cause it it w the problem is if you change the classes, it the object's serial numbers change and you can't re-load the object, so all the processing has to be done over again. And I haven't quite finished it. So It would become out of synch and get a bit funny. If I gave you one if I gave you it one and you worked on it, and then I changed it and run the thing again, you wouldn't ever be able to load the objects back up. And you'd have to and then you'd have a v multiple copies of objects all over the place and it'd get silly, I think. But if you can if you wanna make the picture c you can do that without anything, I'm presuming. Ju just the That, yeah. The text box. 'Cause that doesn't Okay. Alright. Well it won't take very long to get it all finished. But I think I'll need to have done all of this stuff too first. 'Cause otherwise the objects won't be the same. No, it's on my home directory. Yeah. No, I haven't global yet. When it's finished up global, otherwise it would get confusing. That way it doesn't crash if you try and load all ten in one it crashes, doesn't it. It it's a bit dumb, if you can fool it, if you c if you c load up ten different si engines simultaneously, it can do that fine. But it can't do them it can't do them if it thinks one, 'cause then it's about the amount that each if you you have to kinda call a new class and then it will do it fine, but if you don't then it won't l Yeah, it says okay, oh yeah, I've got all this space, you can use some. Otherwise it goes oh no. It talks to me, yeah. Say nice machine, it goes Oh, they're done, are they? Okay, cool. They pop up. Uh yeah. Welcome to the L_S_ N_L_S_D_ browser. Some some some speech and some music, some drum rolls. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or a switch-board that comes up that's just a blank form like that with some buttons on. Load me a meeting, load me a search, load me something else. Whistle a tune. Yeah. Hmm. I that's cheaper than X_T_ search. It would need you to have a meeting loaded before it will start doing any searching at all, doesn't it? You can't the the only thing you can search is a NITE object model, and the only time you get one of those if you've loaded an observation. Yeah, which we but doesn't that way c you cou you could use the inverted file search to return a list of of meetings and then use one of those to load a search. But you won't It has to be an observation, and even if you go and se you can go and search the whole corpus from that, but you have to have it has to start with something for some bizarre reason. The engine there's only one there's only one search method to the search engine. Uh the engine class only has one search method. Yeah, yeah, globally, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. It doesn't take long to load up anyway. You can load a dumb one up that doesn't have any Exactly, yeah. Yeah. But only gives one at a time anyway, doesn't it? 'Cause otherwise you'll crash the thing. Yeah. It's not too slow though, that thing. It shouldn't it's not it's not too bad on that. I don't think that will be a much of a problem. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Ma make it strings for as long as possible, and then only return the things when they actually needs to has to search. When it needs to be loaded. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Did we think about um better names for the meetings? Oh do they do they re-translate them? Do they? Okay, well that's alright then. We'll just use that then. Well that's what's the that's the working group, is it? Okay. I wanna see the meetings about even better understanding. Okay, that's cool, that's good. So who would the the um I_D_F_s? I mean the D_F_s. The document frequencies for each word in the corpus. Yeah, to do um what Steve's talking about you do. To do the topic labelling. If somebody's done the keywords or the the g I_D_F_s or the D_F_s already would. Can't you do any better for our search without the T_F_I_D_F_? I think you need to. It's the amount that they occur over documents. Basically, the amount they D_F_ is the document frequency is the amount that each word occurs um no, what is it? Term frequency is the amount that that it occurs in ea one of them is the amount it occurs in each document and the other one is the amount it g occurs generally. So if you so the more it occurs in specific documents, compared compared to its general score, the bet more informative it is about a certain The corpus, the corpus, still data. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. But plus a stop list, so you remove stuff that doesn't ta it like yeah, and then the, which is gonna a a prob basically equal score. Or a massive Bunch of key-words. That'd probably be easiest thing. Key-words. Yeah, key-words, three f three, five words. In both documents. Yeah, term frequency inverse document frequency. I did do it once, I do have a Java class that does it for something, I don't know whether it'll work with this. But Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. also key-words gives you a a whole new type of search. You do keyword search. But you could do key-word search could be topic search, can they can be the same thing. Instead uh it would just search for key-words when it when they you tell him that with topics, but actually get searching with key-words. For each do you see what I mean? But I suppose even calculating the the w the the what's-its-faces themselves would be too much too long. The easy bit is it's probably the easiest to calculate them based upon in their whole occurrences in i in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic, 'cause you don't have to integrate as much information. No, you can do you can do search without T_F_I_D_F_, you just can't rank the search. Yeah. No no no, but that's what isn't that what the idea was in the first place to rank these rank the results so that Yeah, but that won't slow it down. Ranking it won't slow it down. Yeah. It still uses an inverted file, but it ranks the results by the amount by the higher yeah. I thought that was part of it, but yeah, okay, it doesn't matter if it's not. Um No, we did Yeah. But yeah, I guess uh if you do if if that's not part of it, don't worry about it, it doesn't 'Cause I'm only gonna do this if I've got time anyway. So Yeah. Well it'd just give you a rank. It would that was the whole point was to if you say, this is your top one, this is your bottom. Yeah. But say but it's How how informative? That T_F_I_D_F_ is an informative score, isn't it. So Depends how you treat your compound nouns. like what? As a compound noun. Uh Sunny day, yeah. And like an adjective, yeah. Um in its most simple form it would do a separate rank for each one, each term. You could make it more complicated and make it do for th for the yeah. Yeah. You can just add 'em up, or you can Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you don't wanna start looking for bo Yeah. Um I guess you just do a sum of the um of the the individual T_F_I_D_F_ for each term returned, and that generally will be a bit crude, but it will give you a d score, and the higher the more uh more informative each term is for each thing would give you a a thing. It's pretty crude anyway, but it's just looking for um if it's all it's gonna do is look for six separate c oh, 'cause then it's gonna go into the N_X_T_ search and return that, isn't it. So mm Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's true. So yeah, that's less crude isn't it. But um Groups of terms. Yeah, without doing any like um word pairs, which is just omission. Yeah, I don't know how that works. That's how I remem Yeah. But then the idea is, that gives you an informative score. How you combine that is is up to you. I guess it there's lots in the literature. I if s if you were is there's a lo whole load about it in Manning and Schutz. So They've got a whole chunk about it's so just I_R_, isn't this. Basic information retrieval. They've got a big a good chapter on it. If you haven't got it, it's on Cognate., yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Hundreds of P_D_F_s. Yeah. Okay. Do you want that on the start-up screen, yeah? 'Cause Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, yeah, I guess that's useful. Uh you can have a save preferences. You could have a save preferenc preferences, I guess. Well alright, call it favourites then. You can have a favourites. Yeah, it's not enough information, is it, to. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it would be quite good if it has yeah. Just a b search buttons, so just Mm. Yeah yeah. Doofus mode. Or search, yeah, yeah. So if even if it just had two things, just said one sai one said take me straight to this meeting and have a m text-box you can enter it, or a drop down menu. And then another that said search that loaded instantly. It loaded up the search screen. Yeah. Yeah yeah, or one that yeah, or one that Yeah. Yeah. Or the other thing to do is just have search as the default. Just it opens and the search window opens. And that's the interface, and you just go from there. And then that brings up the browser after you f searched for something. Or or the search but the search window could have on it something that said just has a drop down menu that says just and a go button that said take me to this. And so the f so the in yeah, so the f only thing that comes up when you're finished is a um when you start it's just one window like that and it's got all the search stuff like down there. And so this is your search. It's just all here, and here is just go to wherever and a go button. And then from there it takes you to wherever else you wanna go. Yeah. And the other topic says welcome to welcome to our browser. A drop drop-down menu. Oh, you wanna have oh yeah, the users. They're always nonsense, yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, it does. This is good, but if you wanna search a search, if you wanna look for one meeting and just look at it, then that's fine. Um that's that's true, that's or unless you have two. One one is one one there where you got two, one for meeting, one to speak. Or and you can choose, you can go go for go or go for the other. Go on go for both. If you go for both, you're searching Yeah. We could do Microsoft stylie and hold it over and it pops up a thing. Is that complicated? Mouse over, isn't it, or something. Actually in this n Oh let's do that then. You get out of the bloody way, I'm trying to do a search the damn thing. Yeah, that's true, that's annoying. But that's why you could just have a list of your users then. And just you just say I wanna look for this user. Go. Find me. Find me, then then then it pulls up a list of all the ones who got that user in it. And then you search then but then you didn't search. Maybe just leave it, just have them there, and don't worry about the speakers. If they're doing speakers, they're doing search. It's not the same as doing a a quick access. Yeah. Or you can have a f text box there that's got yeah, as you go over them. Then that doesn't get in your in the way. Yeah. The full name and then speakers. Yeah. We can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near loading up a I think. Oh cool. And uh a thing. A meeting, a nom. Yeah. I think it's in the right object model, but I'm not sure. No uh yeah, is you're right, it's the right corpus, yeah. It's the not right corpus and then you got not right elements in it. Got not right attributes in Yeah. I think the N_ ones are interfaces and the NITE one one of the ways round one's an interface and one's actually an implemented class. Uh 'Cause you go back enough and the um the what's its name is not very good. The A_P_I_ is alright, but there's not a lot of description in it. It's very crude. It tells you what Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you end up just it saying returns an N_ text box. Okay, what's that? Doh. It's a implementation of an N_ text interface. What's that? Oh, it's a extended version of a Stop it. Might be useful, mightn't it? Yeah, I should have more to talk about. Oh, for next week. No, just after S_P_ two. Yeah, yeah. I don't mean straight after. Yeah, for that. Yeah, that could be quite good. Right. Um Friday morning? Three o'clock. I don't know. Maybe I do, I'm not sure what I'm doing this weekend. Um Two. Should we say three o'clock and then if there's a v serious problem, I'll tell you. It's might not be too we th I don't think we need a probably Three's better than five or six. three so say three o'clock and then um if there's a problem with that, then if three o'clock's a problem, five or six will be a problem, 'cause I won't be here. But I don't think that won't be I'm not sure. Is she collecting them? Oh, you're just sending it to No. I mean, is she collecting oh right, oh yeah, sorry. Yeah. School for the gifted. Yeah. Well I thought somebody was collecting them. But right, well that's what I thought when you said that. Then we'd know who's missed them or who's if we've done any. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah, that would help a lot for that s for single terms it would be very useful. For multiple terms, unless you wanna do something there will be a way of doing it for multiple terms. Yeah. Or you could do it and override it by the you ca you could just ignore the d ranking if it doesn't show up together. Or you could perhap you could penalize it, you could just put a b weight against it. Yeah, you do the N_X_T_ so so it doesn't show up together. Either disregard it or put a weighting against it. So if you g how many pairs you get, you can Yeah, so then just next. Yeah. Yeah, might have to talk to Pernilla about that. 'Cause some things you're gonna get a lot of results for. And if the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom when it was actually the most relevant one, something like that would just push it up. Yeah. Which is the highest, exactly. And um also with their something like sunny day, the um if sunny and day aren't mentioned together a lot but sunny just happens to mentions once, then its term will be low and it will push down the other one if you combine them. If you just dup add them together. Yeah, yeah. But you have no ranking system at the moment, so if something's an amazing w highly ranked thing from T_F_I_D_F_, it could just be ignored because it falls off the bottom of the do you have a assuming you only have you have a return all results for all so you type language and it returns seventy five meetings. Yeah, there are already seventy f but there are seventy five meeting. Yeah, yeah. So if it m so yeah, if you return seventy five, wh where do you stop? How do you rank them or something. Or returns twenty, even if it returns twenty, do you cut off at ten, do you rank them, do you what's the threshold? Something like that would be Look through them all, yeah. One at a time and Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So is that it? We're done. Tick. I've signed off already.

'Kay. Hmm. Did you wanna take a look at comments. There's more uh Yeah. Oh? Okay. Excellent. Okay, right, see ya. Okay. Yeah. Mm. 'Kay. Um one thing that I was wondering, is there a standard control that you use to connect the different things? Like if you're in a topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever, is there a particular type of control that like is there one of these N_X_T_ or sorry, um NITE controls? N_O_M_ or Okay. Mm. You haven't had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing. Like other topics or well we're gonna do one for speaker I guess and all the rest, right? Or no? No. Well okay, um when we talk about speaker characterization, how are we accessing the list of speakers? Okay. Right. Hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Actually, I know, that might also help. Like when he was talking about like have an architecture that things are gonna plug into, I mean so that things are all modular, I mean it would be a good idea if we used that same idea for anything else we do. Or what else are we doing? Um actually even the searches or whatever, you know, just any sort of thing. I mean search results, if they're all in a predictable thing with a name, certain properties or a list of properties, a vector. Whatever. Um Mm right. H um yeah. Yeah. Just a matter of deciding what we what would be easiest, all the way around I mean. Oh. Right. Okay. Strange. Right. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So each time are you going straight to the X_M_L_ files for for the information or right. Oh well. Oh, I see. Okay, I see. Okay, right. Right, okay. So it's all just pre-processed and just okay. Thanks. Right. Okay. Right. Okay. That's cool. Yeah, right. Right. Is this is it for the entire corpus? Or is it just like individual ones, like t one fi one object for okay. That's nice. Oh, each meeting, okay. Alright. Wonder if that would be useful for some of the other stuff we're doing. Well, yeah. No. No no. Just Right, okay. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Or just return a null or a blank or a blank string or something, yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Alright. Yeah. Right. Okay. It's a good idea. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Actually I can up-load my stuff as well, I just have to make one change to your file. Just to load this one instead of the the default. So it's two lines of code. So Um what do you mean? Well yeah, just the one thing that's like the action for loading up the search thing. Yeah. Well your version, yeah, yeah. Yes. No. I did in my directory, just uh just do that, yeah. Um I have a copy, yes. I'm yeah. But I will yeah, I was going to update that one just 'cause yeah, it just makes sense that then you then you can test out yeah. Right. Right, yeah, and then update. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't I haven't made any changes to it yet. So yeah. Um yeah, I'll just make that one and I'll let you know. 'Cause yeah, like I say, two lines of code, if that. So, anyways um and then you can play. There's not much to do yet. But Have to get better results, like better presented. Yeah. Yeah, and just um to wire in the the topics and uh summaries. So um yeah, that's pr Well, also yeah, like that, that as well. So yeah. Yeah. just wanna find out what kind of objects those were that um for the other ones. So It goes in and highlights, 'cause that's I know. Hmm. Oh yeah? Okay. Right. Okay. Okay, sounds good. Um so yeah, just a few more things to do with that and then uh once Pernilla gets the uh the index, um then that's gonna be kind of fun. Like I'm just wondering, have you had to well the way you're doi I was gonna ask if the way you were doing it, you were loading like a new corpus each time for each meeting, but you're doing the objects. So you don't need to just uh 'cause if we're if we do have t like if the inverted search says that there's, you know, ten documents, are we gonna have to load each of these ten corp corpora just to um do the individual next uh N_X_T_ search? Yeah, I think probably, yeah. Are you serious? That's a Yeah, okay. That's insane. 'Kay. Right, okay. Okay. Oh yeah. Okay. Okay. Oh. Okay. Hmm. Or just or is it more like right. Oh right, yeah, exactly. It doesn't take too long, no. Just we have to yeah, while we're debugging we'll probably be getting sick of it. Um but no, or something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things. Yeah. Hmm. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right. Mm should mm. Yeah. I was just gonna ask if we should assume that they all wanna load a meeting first, but not necessarily. I guess if they're doing a search on the entire, yeah, corpus. Yeah, that kinda makes sense. Right. Well we can put the logic in a, yeah. I could probably even that s shouldn't be too hard to put a check in there. And if it hasn't loaded then force him to load one. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Unless they know what meeting it is. Well yeah, it's hard to Yeah. Yeah. Or well the things they may n just be looking for a word or whate you know, like and if it shows up ten different meetings, then at that point they'll probably wanna like we do we want to like if it dumped by default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returned, I mean then they have to go through the Well no, t like to load up Like the thing is that I think Uh like when it loads up it'll load up the transcript window and the, whatever, other window. Right now I think just the topic ones. Um Although the time is probably more um caused by loading the actual data. So I'm just thinking if it's kinda like you were saying, you have to have a nom object, right? I mean before you do a search at all on this. Yeah. Okay, right, yeah. That's true, yeah. Yeah, but the okay, the global one feeds into the local. Um so if we're getting any usable data it's it's gonna be doing a search on each of those files. So it's gonna be loading up each of those one at a time to get the data that we wanna Right. But it's it could be time consuming, like if there are ten documents that hit with this thing, then Oh. Um yeah, well I'm j just thinking of some way we could, you know, st cash the results and in a nice little format that'll make things a bit easier. But the thing is I mean if we've got that, then it's gonna be needing really really to load the entire corpus for that meeting, if uh if it's trying to show us where those were, if it's trying to highlight those in the text, transcript or whatever. And we're gonna have to have all that other data in there. So each time when we have a she search window and we have like, you know, ten different meetings, you know, with the word wireless comes up, go to meeting one, then it has to reload the nom object. Next one. I mean that's gonna that could be yeah? Okay, right. It always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least, like that's all I I've been doing lately is just sort of loading it up, test it, try something else and then shut down, load it up. But So um so just sorta based on that as a yeah. But uh if it doesn't take that long each time, then that should be f alright. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. That Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. And that way if they know specifically which meaning it is then that'll save the time. Because I'm sure they don't wanna have the extra loading time either if they could avoid it. So yeah, or they could check mark against the ones they wanna check. So Well I think they were in the text. We can probably do that ourselves and just sort of B_D_B_, you know, just do a a string. Yeah, the long names. Yeah, yeah. Like the the working group that it's part of. Yeah. That probably even might have a. Yeah. Yeah, right. See if it's accurate. Um do we actually need the uh the frequencies? Yeah? Oh right, that. Right. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Well thing is if it's being done, there were there was Yeah. There's a @'s trying to get uh to work on Friday. Um they did have all that and it was sorta built in and just uh had some trouble getting it running properly. Um but it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff, but it w it last I heard it wasn't working. So She was gonna look at, you know, more straight-forward sorta thing that really just fulfils what we need it to do. But if we need the if we do need the frequencies, then Um I don't know. Um well it was would've been like a list of What's it stand for? Hmm. Mm. Well the corpus yeah. So yeah, the probably probably term frequency. Yeah, so the general one is pr yeah, yeah. Right. Actually what's the I_ in T_F_I_D_F_? Really? Okay. Oh yeah? Alright. Yeah. Uh-huh Right. Oh yeah. Well do we need to? I mean we're just looking oh, for for your s for your stuff I guess, yeah. For topic with Um Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. I don't think we had that in the the document. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I know. Hmm. Right. Yeah, b nice to have. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm. Well I don't know. Actually 'cause the thing is I mean typically yeah. But th um the thing is we're just looking for when it happens in a meeting, if they're looking for particular term or something, they just wanna know if that term exists there and where does it exist and I wanna see it, you know. Yeah. 'Kay. But if it's like a two word term, does the T_F_I_D_F_ handle that? It's not a compound noun, it's just two words together. Um in f I don't know. I don't know. Just something like uh Edinburgh University. Yeah. Well, essentially, I don't know. Or sunny day. You know. Hmm. Let's not make it more complicated. Yeah. Because the thing is the thing is that the way we were doing it we were just looking for the words, period, each word in the um in the index. Well that's way we were thinking about it. And then then it's just saying were these two words in in any of these documents, and then if it was then we go closer and do the the N_X_T_ search uh to look for the exact term or the regular expression or whatever. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that. So yeah. Um Like I'm just wondering if if it's gonna give us something cool, then yeah, absolutely, but if it's sort like if the N_X_T_ search has still gotta be run to find these terms or these, you know, these patterns, then uh Or also like do um wild cards work for something like that? So if you're looking for wireless, wired, wire, blah, blah, blah, you do wire with a star and um no? Not y actually, that's a problem for me too. So Or Pernilla. And uh Yeah, 'cause Actually it should work, yeah. Okay, then I'm just yeah. Sure that's not too bad. Oh yeah. Oh yeah? Okay.. Yeah, I've got uh somewhere P_D_F_. Yeah, what if it's yeah. Do the P_D_F_s, switch it to Postscript, switch it back to P_D_F_, and then Don't know. Okay, so that's okay, that might be good. Alright. Okay. Oh, I thought we sort of dis you know what I mean. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Or attended, yeah. P probably for the most part, I mean there'll be a set of people that do, and then a sub-set for each meeting probably. Search for stuff or start working or No. Or or browse okay, like search, browse um Like if you're looking for something speci like, is that what you're thinking? Like if they if they know exactly where they wanna go, they wanna go to, you know, that meeting on December third, and they just wanna go there and see stuff, then they can immediately go and browse that. Um Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Browse by meeting, browse by blah, browse by speaker. Like did no, I'm just thinking of different ways we can do that, like different buttons on the top. Like if they're looking for particular person, particular working group, particular whatever, I mean we just uh we could break things down like that to that level of detail if we want. Or we could keep a more general. Yeah. Um yeah, but I'm just thinking like initially, when they load up. What are the range of things that they'd wanna do? Like if they're part of X_ working group, they'll wanna get in there. Um do we wanna save preferences? Well, if they're part of B_D_B_ working group, they're gonna wanna look at the B_D_B_ ones and so we'd default to that. Or don't know. Based on what they did the last time. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah, okay, right. Yeah. Yeah, okay yeah, that's yeah. Right. What was that? Yeah, exactly. I forget. Right. Um okay. Well no I'm just getting back to sorta what could be on the the start-up screen. Like there is just a range of things we could do, we could have like search options, browse options. I mean just I don't know, just playing around with ideas. Um and then we can tie this into our evaluation uh tasks and say well if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular meeting, then do this, blah blah blah. So we can, yeah, sort of um, you know, guide them. And just like hey, my task is to do this and there's a button for it. Oh, p perfect. You know. You know. I don't know. No no, that's not what I'm suggesting. No, I'm just saying like these are just like a lot of programmes well kind of lame programmes do have that sort of thing first, just 'cause they don't want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves and just like do commonly used tasks or just exit and just let me use the programme, you know, as well. So Probably or search something. Yeah. Yeah, like find specific meeting. You know, that's an easy sort of thing and. Mm. Mm-hmm. Fits his criteria. Well we don't actually have user names, do we? Aren't there all these codes like AMI eleven or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. In a case like that we do want drop-down. We don't want them to type them, do we? Okay. Um and allow multiple? No. Okay, you're just looking for one specific speaker, right? Yeah. Okay. Alright. Oh for speakers. M Oh. Mm-hmm. A tool tip. Mm-hmm. Yeah. 'Cause Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, just so yeah. That's like nice and easy. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right. Just yeah. Just but it's I think in that case it's the wr write corpus? Is that what it is? Writable corpus or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And N_X_T_ something and Oh. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Area, yeah. Yeah, drove you crazy. Oh God. Hmm. Um not really, just gonna keep on going. Like Friday afternoon or something? Okay. Then we won't have to have the meeting with Steve on Tuesday. Or at all. Yeah. So Do we wanna arrange this get this one earlier maybe? Three or I don't know. Yeah, that's true. True. Mm 'kay, yeah, sure. Um Hmm. Possibly, I don't know. Usually by then it's need a break. Um although well, I don't know, 'cause it's the lab and try and get some work done for the the lab stuff. Yeah. Oh, okay. Ten to two. Or th three o'clock? Or no or you wanna get out. Get away. Okay, right. 'Cause I think she's got a class at eleven. We've all got cla well three of us have class at twelve. Um could go Or if we could try one. We could try shortly after. Well yea yeah well yeah. Well it wouldn't be a long meeting then. Or no. Would you wanna no, probably not. If one's bad for you, then it won't okay. Right, okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay.. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Um there's just sorta the basic implementation stuff that I was wondering about. But um no, it should be fine. Um it's just progressing. Um we d did we decide whether it should be ranked? No? For now. 'Cause Yeah. Well I d I kinda think it would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot. Just because if it is like independently doing the words for a particular document, it's not it's not really getting them together. Like if someone's looking for a particular term. Um I don't know, it just I just don't know if it would bring us that much. How so? If if if they're looking for, like I say, sunny day and, you know, sunny shows up in this document, day shows up, but they're not together. Um or if if they are toge I don't know, it just doesn't you're looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up, it shows up. Hmm. Right. In in that sense for single for single word yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, create a new yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, but you still have to do the search. You still have to do the N_X_T_ search then, right? If if it doesn't show up. Yeah, yeah, I know. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, it'll yeah,, yeah. Well it wouldn't show up on the search results if it if it didn't exist together. So Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We'll have we'll have to talk to Pernilla about this then, just 'cause uh see how she's uh doing this. 'Cause if we are using that, I mean it does make sense for that, but uh yeah, and just actually yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's sorta what is yeah, that's true. Well the thing is also I mean if it's well yeah. Yeah okay, I see what you mean. Um and then we could actually put that like on the list of um meetings that r get returned. If there were fifteen meetings with language is in, then it's gonna show you those and rank them as to which is the highest. So okay, I see that. Hmm. Yeah. Well the thing is I mean that'll be exactly how we're doing it now, like we're just looking for the two words separately, see if they exist in the same document. If they do, then there's a possibility that they c occur together. And then we do the N_X_T_ search on that document. Yeah, no. Hmm. Um well right now it's not doing anything. So I don I don't know I don't know what what it's doing. But yeah. Well I thou yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Okay. Hmm look through them all. Well Yeah. I think so. Okay. Yeah. Mm.",EN2002c
"Okay. Yeah. I mean m my view on this was that um the need for people to back up their data personally was made sufficiently clear to lab users. Um I mean I guess right, okay. As long as she admits it, then then that's fine. I I'm just thinking, you know, sometimes when there's a a process error like that, you think oh, then there's something we should change. Like make the sign in bigger red letters. But I in the our case, I don't think there's anything more we can do really. So Um well, I doubt anybody'll do that again 'cause that'll get around. So Yeah, there was a mailing list before. They've just revived that, right? Right, okay. Uh-huh. Right. And we don't know so there's every chance of this falling over again if it's a hardware thing, right. But there's not much we can do about that apart from Right. Yeah. Why is uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. So how long does this put you back for? Is it you know. How much disruption does this cause? D is this a day? Two days? Day and a bit? Yeah. Uh-huh. To actually do the re-install. You c Mm-hmm. And I saw uh a bunch of stuff about software updates. That's un unrelated to this problem, right? Um the Eye-Link. I c I didn't read 'em. I saw like five messages go back and forth. Maybe they were under the wrong subject header. So anyway, we have well Oh no, I mean the Eye-Link software. So it's unrelated, it's not that right. Okay, good. Um Yeah. So uh i uh did he get his data in? Or is this put his schedule back? He's done it, okay. Right. Um well unfortunate, but it sounds like um you guys are well placed for dealing with it. So better you than me. Yeah. Oh so you need to borrow somebody's head and mouth and stuff to to run it, right. And Yeah. Mm-hmm. So I've got a new um trainee who might need amusement at some point. So if you need to borrow a head that talks that doesn't necessarily need to do much else, I'll th I'll ask her if she'd mind coming down and helping you out for uh a while. But I guess Ellen was gonna be your the p the person who yeah, your spare head. Right. Yeah. So um uh mine is well, she's actually climbing Ben Nevis today, I think. But uh she'll be uh back tomorrow. Her name's Nynke. Did you guys meet her? This seems the sort of thing that people might might find i find amusing to look at. So um I I'll I'll see if if she'd be willing to Oh, who is that? Oh yeah, Heidi. Oh yeah, she's good. You guys might actually have something in common 'cause she does, well, you know, stuff for the video coding and gesturing. And autism. But So, okay. Uh right, what am I writing. Uh okay, Nynke to volunteer. Well uh no uh I will actually give her the the option. But um it sounds like the kind of thing where, you know, I think it's quite useful when you're at that stage to see the different kinds of technologies people use. So Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oops. Well, you found that then. Right. Okay. So we want one you can pick up using Matlab or something, right? Aye? Okay. Perfect. Perfect. So or you're gonna bank the script some place and tell us how to run it. Uh-huh. 'Cause we won't know. Right. Well that all sounds good. Oh really? Oh okay. Uh-huh, okay. Very nice, very pretty. It doesn't get in the way of seeing what's underneath? Version one. Mm-hmm. It's not too bad. Uh-huh. I c I can I can see where that's useful. No. Just change it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Although if if you had a big thing and it was jiggling around like anybody's business, like real eye track traces, then you might find that a little bit disconcerting. I mean small things you kind of expect to jiggle around, right. But It'll look like it's quivering, you know. Yeah, but well, that's all fine.. What else? You were saying Joe with the model builder. Oh, remind me. Oh yes. Okay. Oh that's good. Oh okay. Really? Just the parallelogram. Right. Okay, so you your job in this is to um ensure that it actually is a bug and then pass it to Joe? Okay. That makes sense. I mean the this geometry stuff is really tricky if you don't do the fold the boxes stuff in your head well, so I can imagine. 'Cause I could get it backwards easily, you know, and so it is just as well for w for you to check this. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so you need to draw 'em in something. Oh, so yeah, I suggested you do that in X_ fig. Is that a reasonable thing to do or no? Yep, mm-hmm. Yeah. So this is this falls down completely if Nijmegen can't run X_ fig. So you better check that with 'em, right? But Okay, but they may need help finding the something if they can't do X_ fig, I suppose. Microsoft though? I mean well, what kinds of They are the paid. Yeah and Uh-huh. Yep, mm-hmm. Okay. So I wouldn't do any any work to find out what'll output S_V_G_. Just ask them, look, you know say we you need something that does S_V_G_ and then um if they if they come back and say ha, then y you may need to poodle around a bit looking for something. But uh you know, let them let them say they've got a problem before you um spend time trying to figure out what'll do it. 'Cause Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. Oh, so well I can imagine there being uh shapes that you could construct in S_V_G_ format that would fox the model builder in some way. I don't know, I mean it 'cause you don't have specs about what sorts of shapes are allowed, right? Um right, it doesn't matter whether they're um convex or concave in funny ways. Yeah, ex And you tried it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Would we want by self-intersection you mean you could You mean like Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well but by self-intersection here, I'll draw here, if I can find the right end of the pen. Y do you mean something like that? Yeah. A and you can rule out something like that, right. 'Cause that's two parts for you. Yeah. Um I mean you know, some f rainy day you might wanna think about Well, I don't know. I mean it you know, later on we can fix it if it if it turns out those parts it's not urgent now. I think this isn't important enough. Yeah. Yep, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Yeah. But but but if they have trouble, you know, half an hour googling and helping helping them is probably worthwhile. 'Cause someti sometimes people I mean it actually I would e I wouldn't expect them to have any trouble finding something 'cause J_P_ is quite up with all the all these things. So Um are th Well, you let's um encourage them not to use um any software that might have idiosyncratic ideas about what S_V_G_ is. She says delicately. I have no ooh, that I wasn't gonna say. I I have no idea whether they have idiosyncratic S_V_G_ output or whether but um their track their track record could uh on some of the other standards has not there have been slightly strange things about it. So Um but in my uh you know, I mean, they sh that should be if Mm-hmm. Um yeah. I haven't looked through other mail. I did see something from Marloes. Is there anything they're waiting on from us that is a problem or i they reasonably happy at the moment? Oh, they've done the pilots? Oh good. Dumped the data. Where is it dumped? B_S_C_W_. Well that's okay. You know, we're not using that much space if it's just for interim. And they have to get out to us some way. Um uh we had a uh brief discussion just before I left about uh this idea of exchanging data by fire-wire drive and I do I don't know if that ever got resolved. But you know, that's not that's not fast enough for little things like this. So I think B_S_C_W_ is the right way to exchange these. We just have to wipe this stuff off and keep separate copies after that. The C_V_S_. Oh, so you're managing that okay, and you haven't run into C_V_S_ before. Okay. Well good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well that's that's reassuring. Course he's sitting on the next desk. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, she'll have to u use the C_V_S_ eventually 'cause we don't really have a good way of doing this otherwise. But Mm-hmm. Well that's it, we'll never see him here again. Watch, I'll find out he's got a better computer at home as well, right?. Right, and what about um the project as a whole? Is there anything that Ruud or anybody is after that we aren't supplying? Not at the moment, right? They're they're critical the to the success of a project. So Y uh yeah, and general places. But yeah, I wouldn't worry too much about it unless they ask you for specific input. Yeah. That's what's circulating. Uh-huh. Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. And John's going. Mm-hmm. Oh that's good. He'll be useful for the W_P_ seven stuff. So Well while you do that I'll be trained in how to hire people. So Uh both. So So is there anything else? What have you got on for the rest of the week besides getting this stuff up and running again? Yeah. Right. So are you concerned about it that I should be looking at it or you happy with it? I mean I sort of wrote the initial draft of it, I suppose. So Um uh slower. Uh-huh. Okay. Um I'll have to look. I can't remember um how this works now 'cause it was a while ago. So Yeah, and you'll get nothing back unless I look at it, right? So i best for for us for me to do that. I i um yeah, i I mean it's really good that you're y um putting things out for for review and saying like why for stuff. But um we don't we also don't want um to burn too much of your time recording stuff that that nobody's ever gonna look at necessarily. So I mean this this might be a good case for or it might uh or it might be that you should just like, you know, talk to me about this stuff if I happen to be around at the time that you're doing it and not y so i if the writing stuff down on the Wiki gets to be too high a proportion of things, then then you don't necessarily wanna do it. You do you know what I mean? The so um I th I think it's great to have the records and that's really important, especially in in big dispersed groups, but this is kind of a smaller group. Um so it you know, we can do things more informally where f you feel the Wikis are getting in the way of things. So Oh yeah, it well if it aids you in thinking to write it down, then definitely write it down. 'Cause, yeah, we want clear thinking. Um I can't actually remember uh i how it worked with the the moulds. I mean I w I wanted to make sure that um No, I can't even remember. So I'll I'll look at it. Uh but uh I'm sure it's fine 'cause um it's just my memory of things. Oh yeah, uh-huh. Yeah. So um is that gonna have a voice-over or is it we had discussions before you started about whether it should be completely silent so that they could use in case we ever wanted to do this in in Dutch, yeah. And uh and so, you know, you could just have sort of well the I think we discussed having it with an English voice-over or having it with no voice-over and then having it w just with cartoon noises or something like or you know when things break. So to emphasise the I may be imagining it. Oh, so we could produce a Dutch voice-over for the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, the oth the other issue is um uh i if we do a voice-over uh does that affect the language that the people choose to use. S so that might be another reason for not doing that. Alignment or you know. Yeah. So I think maybe that was another reason for um just having. Or or or ding for, you know, you got it or I don't know what. Yeah yeah yeah. Well that y Yeah. Well you need some way to make sure that they actually notice the thing you're trying to explain to them if there's no voice uh Or or you could just point to you know, have b great big arrow that points at the two pieces that broke. You know and Yeah. So you gonna clear or r however you do this with Ellen, right? 'Cause she's the one that has thoughts about the language and stuff. Oh well remin remind her that there was a question about whether there oughta be one. Mm-hmm. I bet Marloes just talked to 'em. Ah I think it's really up to us to Is it hard? You don't wanna give 'em the specification, you know, 'cause that's in too high-falutin a language. But um oh, i it can't be that hard to generate something that says Mm-hmm. Oh um uh on my holidays we encountered a children's toyshop where there we there were tamgrams. And my son reminded me that he ca hasn't been able to find his tamgram set in a while. Well uh if not if you guys are using it. Or do y do you find it helpful to have it? Oh, but it's so tactile to have the little metal bits. If you if you're using it, keep it. He's got plenty of toys. If you're not if you're not using it, then I'll take it back. Yeah, y it's not it's not a worry. The the lad has plenty of toys. Oh, similar types, uh-huh. Yeah. Right. So um how you gonna get your complexity ratings? Google. Is there a big tamgram community that ranks these things? Like, you know, that's just one booklet that came with one set of tamgrams. Or or is it obvious like when you look at these things? Yeah. But that still won't tell you well how many tamgrams are there that they're using? Fifteen or something. No, not even. Uh-huh. So that's not gonna g so that's not gonna tell you anything about relative complexity. That's just gonna tell you where in the span you wanna be. You still need some kinda scale for these things. Ca uh if you look at 'em, do you just know? No. I would either. What about him? I if h Mister Geometry. I mean, you know. Can you tell just by looking at these how hard people find them? Or right, okay. Well Who is Psychology already uses tamgrams that's still around? Mean, people have been using tamgrams for ages. So there must be somebody with a folk wisdom you can contact. Right. I only know ancient papers. So like late eighties. Do people still use tamgrams? Oh. So we're very old-fashioned. Well there was stuff in the seventies and the eighties, right? So Since then. Right. Well, the old the old tasks are the best. So I'm not gonna let that worry me. Um So uh sorry, that was k I think a big diversion, and we were talking about what you were gonna do next after all this stuff was up and the I was gonna look at the G_D_F_ spec. Are the rest of the y uh are is the rest of what you're to do with that software fairly clear? 'Cause this is about the analysis. You really only need Robin, right, to to specify the rest. Uh-huh. Yep, mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause there were all these issues about how you calculate eye-eye lag and, you know, w what other th analyses we want o want out of this that aren't settled. But I think um, you know, Robin is the person who knows the most about what's required there. And I can imagine it's gonna take a wee while to I can imagine you know, so that might be the focus of discussions next week or something, right, that um what need out of this and Yeah, so you might wanna try and come. If you get that far, try and come equipped with a list of the kinds of things you want out of it and and so we can look through and see. Um uh y Ellen might have views on what kinds of things once we have a list, right. So so Yeah. So, but it'd be good to, you know, make sure once we have a list of the things that we think we're getting of it that it matches her intentions for what we were supposed to get out of it. So um, you know, if we do talk about that, then it might be nice to have her along for it. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Who is that then? 'Kay. Um are they still in the business? Where are they? Okay. Well, they might have the folk wisdom on the complexity, right? So Ninety two's not that long ago. Well it is really. But Um is it a paper you can get? Well, they still do it for library loans and stuff, so. Uh-huh, yep. So do we think next week that's what we're gonna talk about? 'Cause we want wanna ask Ellen ahead of time if she wants to come along for a discussion about oh well, that's that's fine then. Okay. Oh yeah, c she 'cause she her stuff is getting blocked off the mailing list 'cause she's not mailing from her normal account. Yeah. And I can't figure out any way to just approve messages from her without her subscribing at that account. So Um There's only one message so far. It didn't say much. Uh Yep. Anything else? Yeah. Bu I don't think that list is our final word on things and Oh well, maybe it is then. I Uh-huh. I don't think I was fully paying attention to that. I mean I'm not gonna have views on this anyway. What I'm really worried about is making sure that um there's not big surprises for Ellen and and J_P_, you know, when they suddenly discover that they're they're assuming some analysis is in there and we didn't didn't put it in. You know, 'cause now is the time for us to be figuring out what we want out of that data and and getting you write the stuff or getting J_P_ to write the one-dimensional analyses that he was talking about. So Oh right. Okay. So y actually you're breaking this down into two steps now. One is just a straight extraction from the ASCII, and the other one is any post-analysis that that adds information by analysing it. Is that th Yeah, it's just anything that's got shoved through the eye-tracker. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, that is post-analysis. Yeah. So right, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh well, that all sounds good. So I've got o uh one thing to check and one person to ask if she'll volunteer to be a head. And as far as I know that's it for me. See, I have to explain. I'm for for one of my other things I there is now a specific Wiki page that says stuff Jean has to do. And I'm beginning to think that this is quite a good idea 'cause I worry about not doing the stuff people expect of me. Much more than the other way around, right. What documentation? Oh, okay. Well it doesn't actually make its way into its my salary, I'm afraid. So But yeah. I mean I do spend time talking to you guys. So you're getting something out of me.
Yeah. Yeah, we'll go we've got the mailing lists out now, isn't isn't it. So it's everyone should know about it now. Yeah. So so everyone on that list has now being reminded. Yeah, don't store anythi anything sensitive on yeah, don't store anything you you care about on the machines. So Yeah, with the yeah, I mean I di I di I did do hard dri hard drive check um and a memory check, and it says there's no uh there's no problems, but something caused it to go wrong in the first place. So we don't know, we don't know. We'll just fingers crossed and hope ho yeah ho hope that all this is just a software thing that we can just fix like that and that'll be it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean there's there's so what we yeah, one one for one. One we'll try and get done today, yeah, get get Windows back on there. Try and get Camtasia on there and get that tested out, and then that will be I think that's everything we need f before we can before you can start running the experiments, isn't it. So Yep. Yep. Yep, yep. Uh but uh yeah. No, I have to manage to get at things working on on Monday. So that that everything went down like on the Tuesday morning. Um so my m I should get everything working on the um, yeah, on Monday, so sure that the J_C_T_ is actually working, collaborating collaborating between the two machines. Um I had dinner I wasn't actually at dinner but I d have the eye tracker stuff working, 'cause it was just me running roun running round the lab. Um still have to once it's re-installed have to actually do a proper p yeah, of proper pilot and yeah. Yeah. But um but it loo it looks like it was doing all the calibration and drift correction things that s Ellen was wanting on it. So So that don't think there's anything to add to the software for that part. Um Don't think so. Mm. Don't s don't sound don't sound familiar. Yeah. Yeah, so I'll try and try and get Camtasia up and running so I can try it out when when when we've got her coming in. And we'll just sort of do a run-through of proper pilot just to just just so I can see th Yep. Yep. Um yeah, I'll make sure make sure they can actually pick up the f um audio signal as well. Uh so but uh it should be the yeah, the audio signal should be coming out the speakers once it's set up properly. So that should that should make that slightly easier. Yeah, yep. Uh but yeah, so they're fortunate have speakers o on the monitors inside the room. So as long as and what we'll have done is just gonna set up so the uh whatever the asterisk sound is on Windows is what gets played. So so just change sound to whatever you like, just go through the Windows control panel. Yep, yeah so I'll I'll have that running over the weekend. Um so la last week I tried it with a one kilo-hertz sound. Um and it was it c it could detect it, but it wasn't but but it wasn't very clear. Did it with ten kilo-hertz and it's just really clear, where you can tell exactly where exactly where the beep is now. So yeah. So tha it's ju just a matter of um yeah, you just ba basically just play it, just play a ten kilo-hertz sound over the over the speech and then just um compare the two signals basically. Um so I've I've got a little script for doing it. So So Yeah, yeah. Yep, yep, not a problem. Yep, yeah, the the one the one in just installed should have that now. Um we'll double we'll double-check and re-install on software on the on the um eye tracking machines. But yeah, it should uh should be updated without any. So Yeah, so so so we've got like uh a big circle with a white circle in the middle of it for an eye. And we got like a rectangle with two like rectangle buttons on it for a mouse. So Uh no, they're they're they're the same size as the as the original blobs basically. But um so they uh yeah, I think the mouse is slightly bigger, but it's not, you know, it's not it's not hugely bigger. So Yeah. And if it ever ever gets to be a problem in the pilot I can easily reduce the size of whatever. 'Cause that's not too hard. So Yeah. Yep,. Yeah. Uh I'll try it. Yeah, yeah. So so you can you can do it in X_ fig, export them as S_V_G_, and you just get a you just get a list of X_Y_ coordinates. Um and then I'll just write in a little script that turns those X_Y_ coordinates into a part. Well the thing is it's S_V_G_. So so long as I've got something that will output S_V_G_. Yeah, yeah. So I'll als I'll also have a look have a look at that. But the there's there must be plenty of Windows things for th that I o output S_V_G_. Min uh I kno I know I know Um I kn I know Adobe and things have faculties that do it. But obviously they're like a few hundred pounds. Um so, oth but other I I'd b I'd be very surprised if there wasn't a free package for doing it. Um I ha I have a feeling that the um Amaya, the W_ three C_ browser, does it. Have a feeling that that can actually edit S_V_G_ files. Yep, yep. Yep, fair enough. Yeah. Um when will yeah but no I'll I'll create a c I'll create a convex part um just so next week um ju yeah, but it just it it just just happened to be a convex part that I was that I was I was playing with. So it it handled that fine. Um it didn't have any self-intersections, so that might be a problem. So I'll just have to have check that. But Yeah, by by a by a part of it crosses over itself. Um s so it's sorta like a b Yeah, that sort of thing. Yeah. So Yeah. If if it if it becomes a yeah. Yep. Yeah, so for now we'll just just assume that non-interse non-intersecting um and um yeah, and then there's this at the moment the e the S_V_G_ stuff can output ones which aren't closed polygons. But um ones ones you ones that actually had turn up into parts list uh it creates a closed polygon by linking the l end point to the start point. So so uh, yeah, so as long as long as they're yeah, so so so as long as they're they're drawn well enough, it should be alright. So um but yeah, suppose let Nijmegen uh find their find their own S_V_G_, sort of find something that does S_V_G_ and then we'll see if there's any problems. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But it mi it might be worth just checking what software they are using 'cause it might crea it might create outputs slightly different from X_ fig. So Yeah. That should that should be fun. Yeah, I think it does S_V_J_ uh S_V_J_ output. Um so I'll I ca I can easy double-check if uh Nijmegen can't find anything. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but other than that that was easy enough to install though, wasn't it. It was yeah. Copy and paste the stuff out the off off the Wiki. So Yeah. Yeah, I mean uh also double-checked in that we're not gonna w could access the C_V_S_ from home when I was working from home last last week. Um on Thursday I managed to managed to get in and just just check the stuff and make sure it was all make sure th make sure ma make sure I could access it. So they shouldn't have any trouble accessing it once they've got the log-ins. So Not yet, I'm afraid. Uh well on once uh once I've tried out the Camtasia stuff, I'll see if the if there's any problems, gonna tr gonna try and fix them. If there isn't any problems, next time I'm working on this uh G_D_F_ stuff um so so I've I've I pu uh put on a D_T_D_ and a sample X_M_L_ file on the Wiki for the G_D_F_. So it's ba based on some stuff you put on there on the G_D_F_ specification. Um Yeah, I mean with I cha I changed a couple of things from your original draft. Um so there's not uh there's no longer a separate thing for creating new parts. So just put a start and end time on each part. Uh so So the the you you you had a you had a thing call I think it's mould or so or something that you said which is sort of to create a new part. There's an action to create a new part. Um but I th uh I've I gave each part a start time and an end time um so you can see when the parts were created. So I'm not su so I'm not not sure if you wanna keep the mould or not. Uh Yeah, but it's it's just the G_D_F_ specification page on the uh on the Wiki. I've uh I mean I'll try try to put in justification for for the change that I made uh on the page. So um but I've I've sent it out for review so that s anyone who is gonna using the format can have a look at it. Huh. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mind, when the Yeah. Well the ones that this stuff, I mean, is it's helpful. It was helpful for me to putting it up on the Wiki 'cause I could actually thin think about it as I put it up and say well this is this is why and th this is why I wanna do things this way. Um so Yep, yep. Yep. Fair enough, fair enough. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Well uh well I kn I know on Camtasia, if you got a ca if you've got a Camtasia project, you can have the video and audio stored separately. In which case Yeah. So yeah. So so we just ended the just ended the the Dutch stream, yeah, the video and our audio. And then they can easy create their audio out of mm from that outp Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.. Yeah.. Yeah. Well one thing uh one one thing that Camtasia can do, you can have little videos when other haven't gotten got any cameras for doing that. But you could like have videos of people click on the mouses and sorta or whatever else, mm-hmm. You can do yeah, you can generate call-outs and whatever. So The might yeah, I'm sure there must be a way of putting big arrows ov or whatever. Um Oops.. No, I'm an af afraid not. I wouldn't know. No. No, no. That's a s that's psychology thing how hard they Yeah, yeah, so this yeah. Yes, yes. He'll he'll just be working with Robin on what analysis we need to get out of the G_D_F_ format. Um so I'm gonna c basically I've got a the gest analyser's the base the basis for uh um ASCII to G_D_F_ converter. Um so what I'm gonna do is actually create an output uh a G_D_F_ output part to it. Um 'cause at the moment uh only outputs the video. Um but it does have internal structures will just make it easy to do the the X_M_L_. So so that's that's what I'm gonna look at. And then once I've done that I can look at the whatever analysis we need to get done out of the G_D_F_. Yep. Yeah, yeah. Yep. Yeah.. Um I think that's it. And I'll t uh yeah, I'll get get working on the Camtasia stuff this week and then so once uh once uh once we've got some some idea about what analysis you want out of this, I can think about whether G_D_F_'s got everything we need in it. Um and f yeah, what analysis we can pull out of it. Yeah, yeah. So I'll I'll double-check the G_D_F_ specification against that just to make sure it's got everything you said that you'd you say you need from that list. Um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause they I mean we w we got all this in the ASCII format at the moment and it's just a matter of what data do we need to pull out of that into the G_D_F_ so I can actually do the proper analysis. Um 'cause I think all the answers are gonna be run off the G_D_F_ format 'cause 'cause we've decided that if we went and looked well if we're looking at dynamic reasons and whatever else, it has to be G_D_F_. Yeah. Which is yeah, which is why we have to do it off the G_D_F_ as as opposed to the E_D_F_ format. So Yeah, yeah. So so the G_D_F_ it's got yeah, so it's it's got uh the all th the stuff on the um E_D_F_. So it's just the uh the ASCII file the things like the mouse movements and things like that. And then yeah, yeah, and then on top of that G_D_F_ can also it will also have information such as, right, at this point in time they were looking at the new parts area or they were looking at the target. Yeah. Um so yeah. So the the G_D_F_ is gonna have that sort of information in it. And then also 'cause it's X_M_L_ file, we can then do X_S_L_T_ or whatever on to it to get extract whatever bits of data you need for yeah, for for whichever bits of analysis you're trying to do from it. So Yep.
Uh yeah. So we've moved over and onto the other eye link. So uh 'cause she's running at the moment. She did admit it. Yes. Uh-huh. Hmm. No. But ma Yes. Shock and worry at uh I think yeah, there's a there's a mailing list uh and mm-hmm, yeah. Uh F Frank went through it, deleted the people that were have gone or or whatever and replaced them. So the the eye the the list is now updated. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes uh Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yeah. We're doing a bit. See last week by the time everything and and then it'll be hopefully no more than, I don't know what, twenty minutes today to Hmm. Yep. I i yeah. You mean from was that Joe? Or is that Um there was nothing nothing over last week. Joe has uh produced another version of the uh model builder and put that up. Uh well that wa that was Ruud well a few weeks ago. But yeah. Yep, it's unrelated. And was r was running. 'Cause Frank did all that because he then had an experiment. So he's run an experiment and it's all worked. Uh he's he's done his and got his and yes. And he backs up anyway. Maybe too well placed, yeah. Yep. Wh a spare head? Or Uh yes, but she's not around. So uh Nynke. Mm-hmm.. Mm. Well I did meet uh uh uh uh someone from another project of yours on Wednesday evening it was. Hei Heidi, who is the gesture of autism. Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm yep. And autism, yeah. Yes. Sh she's been volunteered. Yep, make sure it uh it starts and finishes when it's meant to and that sort of thing as well. Mm-hmm. Uh yep. Uh yes, with the um the bleep was a hardware bleep originally. And so it comes from the P_C_, which is outside the sound-proof box. Yes. H-Mm-hmm. It comes through the Yeah, yep. Mm-hmm. No. Uh um what else? you have altered the um task programme because uh to put the um little eye icon and the mouse uh to make it Rather than just a blob uh Ellen wanted something to look more like an eye so that you knew that was the eye. There was like yeah, mm-hmm. Want it a reasonable size so that if they're looking at it we know they're looking at it though. So you has to be a a reasonable target uh for the for the tracking purposes. Mm-hmm. With large mm yeah, I suppose the larger more oscillation appears that um it's not w I mean uh it isn't it isn't it isn't that big. So Yeah. Uh yes, he's produced an another version that doesn't uh have the overlap problem. You know, there was the yeah, the collisions. The polygons now don't overlap. Um Marloes discovered something strange about the orientation of parallelograms from when it was constructed to when it appears in the um actual task. But I think that might be something to do with the original configuration than the parts that weren't the same across the two. So I'll check that out uh to see if it really is a problem or not. And basically the parallelogram was appearing in a sort of as a mirror image of what it was like in the uh model builder in the actual yeah. Just total it flipped uh in in a mirror image. Not rotated. So it wasn't anything to do with rotation. It was f yeah, just the parallelogram. So uh entirely sure. Must be some way of how the vertices were described or uh defined in one way or compared to something else. Joe, yep. Well uh mm-hmm. Yes. Uh the other thing we've done is uh looked at n not uh for this current experiment but for future, when we've got to build um bizarre parts like air-craft wings and and things, uh something like X_ fig uh can output the vertex points um for creating the air the actual polygons in the first place. 'Cause the model builder um assumes that there's an existing set of of original parts. So you need to draw them in the first place. So It it i yes. W or something i i uh uh Yeah. So it must be a some sort of pink package. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's not it's not an immediate problem anyway. But I thought it was worth before Joe disappears just checking that the model builder's not restricted to just doing the tamgrams. Or something tha you know. So uh no it does look like it's uh M_S_N_. Um no, but as long as they're solid polygons it should be alright. Uh no, it sh well uh uh hopefully that's not what the parallelogram problem is. Because it it does have sort of sum of angles and things. But uh no, as far as uh I mean it Mm-hmm. Yeah. Or part of it was convex. Yeah. I y yeah, but that's why uh we no, we'll only be working as I say with sort of solid obvious polygons and as parts. 'Cause they'll have they'll have to have a central point anyway for for rotation and and grabbing. But Mm-hmm. Well uh uh realise what we're I would consider that two parts, yep. Yeah. Yep. The last point to the yeah. Yep. Yes, yeah. J_P_ is quite yeah, uh-huh. Yes. The Microsoft version of S_V_G_ or something. Yes uh-huh. I have no idea either. Uh Nope. Uh I think they've um they're not waiting anything from us. Uh they've dumped the pilot, the pilot studies that they generated based on the task with their English participants, or English speaking participants. Yeah. Uh but they haven't done anything with it other than dump the data. Uh they well, they dumped it on the mm B_S_C_ C_W_ server. But I've moved well, I haven't moved it, I've copied it onto the C_S_V_, yeah. Yep. Nothing further is No. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh And I've uh sent a thing off to Marloes talk trying to encourage her again to register for the C_S_V_ and uh and what to the C_V_S_ and uh wha what to do and uh which bit of software I use that seems to be quite easy and simple. Yep. Nope. Well yes and no, as in yes, it's new, and no, I haven't got a problem. Yep. Oh so far. Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh y yes. Uh and I am just using it through um a Windows bolt-on sort of piece of software. Yeah. No I've just yeah, straight-forward and then you just right right yeah, r and right click things in in Windows Explorer. That's it. Mm-hmm. On a day like this I know it's a yeah. Mm no. Not at the moment. The only thing that's been going around is the version of the flier. I don't know what real purpose of uh these little folded up A_ four fliers. Uh there's been bit of uh are they just for distribution at conferences and things? Or do they uh Right. Well I I'm not really bothering. But it there's that's what's circulating around the the group as a whole at the moment. Um I've sorted out uh travel et cetera to Munich for e for Ellen, John and myself. And we're all off on the fourteenth of December. Coming back on the Friday. the sixteenth, yes. That's a so that's How to hire or how to interview, is that that uh book. The Spend. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.. Well mm-hmm. Uh what el uh well I'll have to get to grips with cra Camtasia uh properly uh to generate a little sort of introductory video I suppose uh for instructional purposes at the beginning of the experiment. So people will be able to see uh and so that the p you know, example movements uh and things like that will be In Dutch as well. Um well Oh right. Oh. Huh. Right. Uh no, that must have been before me. So uh uh uh p it I Separated. Yes, mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Exa yeah, so the I mean th I don't think I think it'd be more sensible just to do the non the the video part of it first and then you add the voice-over afterwards. Rather than trying to do all at once. You know. Might use. Or are you going to prime them in any way? Doing uh anything with the voice, you know. If you start talking about have to avoid or uh yeah, talking about the parts or just naming them or anything like that. Mm-hmm. Bef yes. Okay. Or did no n no noise in fact I think is probably uh Yes. Uh pro probably actually not even the sound effects 'cause otherwise they'll expect that in the real experiment and that doesn't happen. So if they make move a piece and it breaks and they don't hear this crash and they go oh, what's, you know what's happened. Is that really all what happened. Yeah, it's uh Mm-hmm. Yeah, mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes, I think it can generate uh things. Uh-huh. Yes. Mm mm-hmm, yeah. Yes, but uh or in our discussion we haven't mentioned uh it was assumed there'd be a voice over. But I'll I'll I better I'll I'll remind her yeah, I'll I'll I'll do that. Mm-hmm. Yes, 'cause we've got to think of the instructions and sort of basic introduction to it all as well. So Actually I I did email Nijmegen to ask if they'd had a set of instructions they'd given their participants, but it probably I s I suspect so because I haven't had a reply back. Yeah, too too uh it was just in case they had something that what Mm-hmm. No, that should be a problem. I'll be straight-forward enough, I think. Alright, you want take it back. Um oh uh t uh no um th it's not got it's uh yeah, it's i well b actually, I could probably just photo-copy the manual. And there's only a Um yeah. Right. Yeah. Right. Uh oh I've hopefully well, I won't hopefully need it for more than another week or two anyway. So as long as you can hold off his No, no. Right. Um I I was looking at the the complexity sort of uh aspect of the tamgrams in that uh booklet. It's not quite that they just get harder. It's that they kind of have pages of similar um types. Yeah. So one page will have sort of parts that are kind of similar to each other and then you move over and there's a different almost type of design or style. Uh so it's not quite as progressive in complexity as uh No. Google. Mm-hmm. Uh I'll try I'll try. You never know what's what's out there. Well uh um I'm hoping the Dutch input will allow us to p sort of have a rough idea of what was the of a suitable complexity for the task. Uh no, not even that. They've of this relevant type to what we're wanting to use, probably three. Uh we've to generate sixteen in total. Mm-hmm. Yeah, ideally. Mm no. Well I don't. I'm not Uh I'll tr I'll try the good old Google and see if there is uh if there are some sort of ranking sites or whatever. Uh I'll try and find out. I don't know off off hand certainly. Uh I'll I'll do a search. B um I've not encountered them. Mm well or maybe they just don't use mm anything like that I suppose for But I'm not sure if anything's happened since then. Mm-hmm. As little as it is, but yeah. Yeah. Yes. Have to To try and, yes, and home home in parameters and choose the right sort of settings. So yep. I'm sure she'll have views on it. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um oh, I found haven't fount it physically yet, but uh a reference to uh a ninety two paper. It's in the royal proceedings of something or other somewhere based on a um an experiment that had blocks a model, blocks of parts and then an area where people had to build, you know, replicate the model out with the parts. Uh just one person at a time of course. But uh it did involve um eye movements and monitoring where they're looking compared to their hand movements and uh that subject. Ballard. Back in ninety two. Yes, I think so. Uh the I'll mm not sure. Yep. Yeah. So there should still be well Not that on. Is it. Y uh-huh. Uh that's what I've m I'll have to try and find out. Uh Hmm. If not um the National Library is bound to have it. She's not here next week anyway. It's next Wednesday or Thursday before she's back. Oh, is that what yeah, she's got a mm Yahoo account or something that things are getting forwarded to and Ah. Or or oh well. That's only if things haven't been getting through. Ah. Um anything else? Well certainly. The the there's the provisional list of what we need on the Wiki anyway that I put it up. So Mm-hmm. Um well I I added things to it. Well, better uh Well I don't know when he last looked at it. But uh Or when I added it. It was sometime in the last two weeks anyway. But uh Mm-hmm. That's what they're getting. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it It's the it's the dynamic regions that uh I think might cause a bit of trouble. But uh That filter Mm yeah, filter out. Unless y Yep, I think so. To do. Hmm. Watch out Well I think according to the latest documentation uh you're down for five percent of your fifteen months on this project or something. Some b uh JAST report. Officially. Into reality, uh-huh. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But",EN2009b
"Okay. Mm-hmm. Or actually look at the pitch, no? Don't ask me how it's done I I know the theory, so, yeah. Isn't it the pitch and the frequency? The base frequency of the And if you have both you can um well, you can compare this to to one stored and so get out uh which person it is. Pardon? And uh well, the things that make the sou the voice. Yeah. And and the the holes in your head, everything, the the nose and so on, and that's that's really uh unique for ev well almost unique for every person, so. Well once you get this information, your frequency and uh your vocal contract or how it's called, uh y you can use this information to compare to to to the frames here. No, but No no no no. That that that everything is done through through the voice here, you take a voice of someone, and then you can get out this information, it's it's not p it's clear it's not perfect, but s it's enough to to to use it for for different purposes and uh Um not not that, well uh as far as I know. Actual Is it called P_C_M_? I thi um well it's it's not a technology s yeah. It's more or less used this to compress audio. I have to I want to check it, I can show it you afterwards. well I did a course about it, but uh I shouldn't say it too loud, because um the professor is working here at IDIAP. I should reread what I signed there so. Well uh it I'm even not sure if it's that important to know which person is talking, because uh if uh if it I think about a table, or so something uh physical, uh you just want to know in in which corner of the table uh speech is coming and not uh which person produced the speech, so. Yeah, but it's not really related to the ah, yeah, I see it's uh you need a bit both uh Sound. You might might want to do. You need to separate it. No, but I think once you have the voice for a person, you can start to do this and uh once uh people have speech recognition or uh far enough to t Mm uh. I think so. The link. Mm. Okay. No, I think does this work, email? Does it work if I put in my email and uh No, if it's not uh I guess you would have to install it and so on. Uh no no no, you see uh I thought you can put in here your email address and and just uh do this and then it mails me. Yeah, you see I want too much. And after all Matlab is also programming, so it Mm-hmm. So. Thank you for the information.
Mm-hmm. Actually uh you can t perhaps just uh just Th there is one frequency that is the base from for uh Okay. Both. Mm the pitch and uh and the freque Okay, s and you can measure measure that? Or Okay. And i is it uh expensive to do, But in fact if y you speak of uh a lot of things that are not expensive, at the end you have uh something that is. Hmm. So you have to do F_F_T_, because otherwise Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes, but it I it it is im It i it yes, it is important for detecting patterns. Because uh if you say uh let's say uh w how much the person um have spoken over the the five last minutes, uh Uh if someone come and yes. Yes, yes. Y This is uh mm. Okay. So i uh this is only based on uh you give uh the spectrum and uh uh okay. Mm-hmm. Yes. But uh the last ones are always the Mm not really. Mm yes. Hmm uh I I said uh we want t to know to um to do separation just because of the voice recognition. I mm this is not the yes. Yes, no, but but in fact we have uh yes, we are designing uh a noise sensitive table just f from your ring, but we are also designing uh a prototype um to analyse the conversations. So uh we might add there a lot of uh features. Okay. And uh I don't know, perhaps uh perhaps if you have two people speaking uh speaking uh at the same time, uh I don't know if uh voice recognition of an uh such a stream is uh real. Okay. Yes, so that's fine. Mm-hmm. Sure. Yes, it's not um every important feature for now, but Mm-hmm. Yes. And uh uh another what uh. Um I don't remember. Yes, also uh to to extract the context. Mm because if you know the words that are spoken, you can let's say uh someone say uh he's angry uh about the word he's seen. Yes. You mi you might want to add uh this kind of this is not in uh my project, but Yes. Um Yes. And have a special events trigger if Sure. Sure. No, it's it doesn't sound simple, but yes, you can yes. Sure. Yes, in fact uh for now we are using uh a kind of calibration, but uh it's still um Yes. Yes, um uh but in fact you have to sit in front of the microphone, and it's uh yeah, people one speak and people two and people three and you are just uh subtracting the the level that you you kept in the other microphones. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, just uh a last question, um when you mentioned it. Um if I'm speaking very uh, how do you say it, um yes, I'm just speaking one word every uh every one second. Yes a. Uh is the the event that is detected is um will be uh a sum of uh small parts? There won't be uh okay. So you yes, you have to to reprocess to uh to say let's say yes. There is a very small um interval. You have to consider it uh. Because this is yes, this is one this can be considered as one interv intervention. It might be. This is not a very uh easy problem. I'm done. Sure, yes. And you can code Java. You can choose Matlab. Yes, sure. You have to code it uh directly to the machine. Hmm. My sheet is very uh filled up. I will take yours.
So b maybe I'll go back to your questions. Um Yeah. Um Yeah. And this also um allows you to separate people. Um and the questions I did not talk about was uh going from location to uh identity of the person. Um That is quite different, you you need to use a signal you have separated and uh do the type of analysis I mentioned. Um from the spectrum you can transform the the magnitude spectrum and um um build model of the person. Um Yeah, pitch at least. But pitch is Pitch isn't is not enough sometimes. I it's a frequency, yeah, yeah. It's a frequency of your vibration here. Uh Yeah. And then it's transformed through the mouth, that's the usual model. Yeah. I yeah, um it's not necessarily done explicitly, but it's equivalent to that, yeah. So again, F_F_T_ is useful to do this type of analysis. Um Yeah, but it's quite personal. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It it's an information equivalent to that. It's maybe n you don't need to do the whole uh complicated modelling, but No, no. Yeah, rate of speech is also possibility. Um how fast you speak, that's quite personal also. But it varies over time, um depending on emotion. That also might be interesting for you, detecting emotion. Yeah, yeah. And us yeah, yeah, so these measures are a way to quantify that. Uh p no. No, no it's not. What w w what is m what is more expensive is to um take the decision finally. So your decision can be for example uh who is it, or if the person moved, which is probably the most complicated thing, like the person goes away, then comes back ten minutes later, sits at a different place. Uh you will need to build statistical models of um the person identity using these measures. So the ones um he mentioned um I don't know if you're familiar with that. Yeah. Yeah. So um No. Yeah. S Yeah. All I was saying is that these different measures are a way to uh evaluate the identity of the person. So if with location all you can do is extract segments of speech, for example, but it will not tell you that these are the same person. It's just a location. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so that might be good for example for ten minutes, but then the person might move, or a different person might come. Yeah. It is. Well, unless sometimes somebody goes there or yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it hmm. But that you can do with location, if it's only on the short term. On on the off-line yeah. I would say you might use these measures in a simple way if you do it uh on-line. Like um to give feedback. But uh you you mentioned that another side of your project is also to analyse off-line. So there you might want to use a We had a student here, he finished uh one or two years ago, but he left his software, and his software is precisely to do that to um cluster at uh another level, to cluster these small clusters of speech, uh group them by person automatically. Y no, from the these measures, pitch, etcetera. So um Yeah, exactly. So I would say from location at the lower level you can get small parts of speech, and then at the next level, possibly off-line, you can uh group them into um a speech segment. I'm hoping to have enough time to try um doing that before I finish my thesis. Um so if I manage to do some um uh practically usable software, I'll tell you. Uh in five, six months, abou approximately. More busy I would say. Yeah. So you said you want to do separation, um but ex exactly, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Ah, you want to do voice recognition. You might want. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So yeah, once you have locations it's not a big problem. Um Mm-hmm. No no, you should separate them first, yeah, yeah. So So the type of things I presented can lead to separation. Um it's only a very small step to add. Yeah, yeah. Although it might be, if you want to um ex extract these features like pitch and uh rate of speech, or energy simply, from each person. Um you might have to do some ba basic separation. 'Cause quite often people uh don't realise that they talk at the same time, um interrupt each other. So even if you don't want to recognise a speech fully, at least um you need yeah. It's okay. You can email later. Yeah. Um So Yeah. Uh Okay. A semantic context, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, then mm. Hmm. So it's uh Yeah, you could detect one word, yeah. Keyword spotting, yeah. So um Yeah. Yeah, I I'll just say uh if you want I can point to um three papers, um but no, I think it's better if I just send you the link, it's probably simpler. Uh one im is about this um sector based stuff, like uh the localisation and detection. One is about how to take the decision, that somebody's active or not. Um it sounds simple at first, you think you just put the threshold and that's it, but um the problem is uh the It no, you can do that. There's no problem, but i if you want your your system to work in different conditions, like cafeteria, library, um the environment will be quite different, so a single fixed threshold value might be a problem. S Yeah. So you can do that automatically, this kind of things. Um I don't know if you're doing that already, but uh Okay. So uh I have another paper which might be interesting for that for a single channel uh calibration. And I've code on-line, so for this particular one. And the last one I would say is um the clustering um to um yeah, the clustering of the different locations over time, so that you can get small clusters of speech. Um there are other ways to do it, but uh I think it's it's important because um in spontaneous speech all these words are quite small. So you need to do that uh adequately, yeah. But otherwise yeah, I'm done. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Many small events basically, yeah. Yeah, basically uh I mean it depends uh Yeah, even if somebody says just yes. I don't know if it's important for you or not. It might be. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Y Yeah. Yes. Um So I I'll send you links some of the papers are long, but you can just um briefly look, yeah. Um we can go and see Olivier, unless you want to talk about something else. Huh? Well, we can try. But uh We have yeah, we have O_C_R_, but maybe not on this computer. Yeah. That is good idea, yeah. It's a good idea. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Once I I um coded the most expensive part in C_ just to see so you can have a mix of both. From Matlab you call C_ and back. But the day you want to do uh on-line real time stuff nah, I wouldn't wouldn't trust it.
Okay. Yes. So you were talking about the two first question? Okay. And a little bit about same people moving, with the clustering. Uh-huh. So this one. What? I'm sorry, I didn't really get the point of comparing the pitch the pitch is the is the frequency that is okay. And the way you transform it uh v by the mouth? You were comparing what with what? Uh-huh, okay, okay. So uh And you were talking about comparing what with what? Okay. But you want to have the information because the the mouth, you move it. To scan t all the user. Okay. Okay, so you have the p the pitch and you have information about the voice dynamic or Mm mm mm. Emotion, the involvement in a discussion. If you are saying oh yeah yeah we should Okay. In C_P_U_ you mean? Not really familiar. Hmm. Okay, so you are the expert. Careful, you are recorded. Okay. Okay, so all this stuff is done from the F_F_T_. Also location to identity. Uh Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. But to get a cluster the location that is uh a place where uh noise is regularly coming from. Mm-hmm. Mm mm mm. But for instance for a setting like uh here it would be enough, because we are not moving. Okay, right. But we are uh targeting a place where we don't know i where it will be more flexible, so we need more than just uh location if we want to uh Mm-mm. I agree. Maybe just I think it may it may be okay, but it depends how long Hmm. From th from the location. Oh. Mm-hmm. When are you planning to finish your Okay. More extensible. Mm. I don't know how mu maybe we would be more interested to know that it's not the same people, more than knowing that it's the same people. Or to detect that someone is more that was not talking before is talking now. Yes. Mm. Mm. Okay. That are further directions. Professor was interested to know when people were talking about him. Ah, someone is talking about me, let's listen. And lighting a on his office. Okay, so are you done w with what you wanted to presented us uh in regards with these questions? Mm mm. three papers about? Mm-hmm. Okay. It's n no problem. No more time for problems. Okay. Uh uh. Mm mm mm. Slowly. Might. For the first application we will do with uh prototypes, it will be more about quantity uh of speech or how long, how much someone speak, but when we will go to final uh details, if I'm talking and someone say yes yes yes from time to time, it show that he's participating, and obviously it makes different that if someone is talking and one is replying never uh nor moving or nor having eyes open Okay. Go through them. Okay. No, I think uh I think we has already have plenty to read. Try. And the application you are using, all of them uh y every time you are using Matlab, or you are programming everything is based based on Matlab? Mm. Mm mm mm. Okay. I'm writing so only me can read.

Has anyone had time to to play with it? Any comments? Um Oh right. Might as well, yeah. I mean yeah. The thing is that, yeah, there is as I said a while ago, there is still this one error which is a bug in in N_X_T_ um that r r always generates these. I think when you when you left-click or right-click or something, I can't remember now. Um but if it's a real error, then it it stops, so you can't do any any more. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, be good. Is there any any comments you have about just like wording and or some sort of minor things? Hmm. Yeah, I know. At the moment as well the whole windows that pop up are not pretty at all. But um, you know, I would make them a bit nice if I had more time, but at the moment it doesn't look like that. So I will if But that took me so long to do this bloody start window. Nasty. So I'm quite glad that it looks, you know, ni nice on one or this kind of thing. No, this is just yeah. Alright. That's odd, yeah. Try that a few times. Yeah, I started I started using your um um the speak I don't know if you've seen that in the yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. But it's good, your your stuff is really coo good. It's got a good interface and easy to use. It's nice. Right. Well wouldn't won't we include that then? Yeah. It's when they say mm, uh-huh, yeah. Yeah. I don't know if that's very useful, because everyone does it. It's very Really? They're asleep, I think. So which you know, suggest maybe you can suggest a few that which which would be interesting to list. Like three or four or something. Mm-hmm. Very nice. Mm-hmm. But I mean do we do we care if, you know why not w I think, you know, it'd be it'd be difficult But it would be difficult if, you know, if in the um speaker characterisation window we had a heading, you know, top five dialogue acts. And then then the little brackets, but they're not actually the top five, but top five minus the most common ones, which are, you know Because For the speaker. Yeah. No, I wouldn't yeah. Exactly, yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, just do top five, both local and global, and then have another Um but then we want a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones, and then You followed all this up. Yeah, see, and that's what speaker characterisation gives you. Who's the one who dr Yeah. Yeah. Um so is is this percentage then um if you say like um joke for this speaker is percentage, I don't know, twenty, is that the ho what percentage of his speech is joke, or w how what percentage of the jokes Are jokes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean just keep it simple as Um You will, yeah. Yeah. Sounds good. Yeah, I was thinking that um it sort of turned out that way a bit, didn't it? I don't know. Does it matter? Oh, I was Mm. I have one one m one little question that I reckon we should have a little icon for our browser. Well no, the thing is um in, yeah, in the the top left. At the moment they've got an X_, which is, you know, N_X_T_ and it's sort of a bit cheeky to use that. So No, we want something original. What do you suggest? We could the only thing I could think of was an M_. But We'd be sued for that, I think. Yeah. Yeah um I mean it's tiny, so we can't really put more than one character really or one sort of simple GIF. No. Well, I can dr Yeah. Well if you find anything, then send it to me. Otherwise I'll I'll make up some M_. I'm not sure actually. I'm thinking yeah. Yeah, yeah yeah, I I know yeah, I know how to how to put it there. But I'll have to import it somehow. I'm not quite sure. But Yeah, yeah, probably. Yes. Oh yes. No. No uh If if the sound-card is registered to your name, which it usually is not, and you have to re-boot, and sometimes it still doesn't work, then yeah. Um Mm-hmm.. Yeah. In fact it's a N_X_T_ package. Yeah. I mean sometimes they have methods that don't have any explanation to them at all. So you just like right, I'll try this then and see what it gives me. Hmm. Friday? I thought it was Friday. Yeah, I think we both should, yeah. Well that's the problem, because Steve hasn't given us any details, has he? That's true. I I'm sure we could do that in like a meeting and make it up together. Yeah. Um the thing is yeah, we had the the deadline last Friday, but we won't be able to do any evaluation during the weekend anyway, so I think we could set Monday. And that would give us the whole weekend. I don't know. I think it was. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly, yeah. At the end we'll say, yeah but you never gave us any test subjects. Well sort of, that's how I understood it. He would he would make something up. Ha yeah, find some people, that's how I understood it. Um the thing is, you know Yes. Um I think if we if we don't get anything from him, then we should just do our friends basically. Well they're your friends, so they should But it's not gonna take long. It's only only gonna be half an hour maybe. Um Maybe, yeah. Well it will be. Yeah. It'll have to be, yeah. Hmm. So Really? I was thinking of like ten. Fifteen. Uh Really? Really? How can you get a range of people if you have three? One art student. Yeah. Yeah. And hen we should just have two. Yeah. Oh dear. Um Another thing, um, we have the we have the um the presentation on like in one and a half weeks or something, whatever it is. Or nearly two weeks. Oh is Tu yeah, it is two weeks then. Do we have to have done the evaluation by then? It's the Thursday. No, the Thursday, I think. I think it's the Thursday. Is that Good Friday already? Wow. No. Well it I'm sure on the web-site it says Thursday. Hmm. Well, you know, the the question is, i do we need the evaluation for the presentation. We should definitely ask him. Because if not, then Yeah, you might be right. Because we need to write a presentation as well. Exactly, me too. That's the point. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm not free after this Monday, but I'm free at like after the eighteenth. Because because I don't have anything after the eighteenth apart from this. Well that's in on the eighteenth. Mm-hmm. Ooh. So um So Anyone fancy writing him an email? That, yep. And But it's still important to know. So we would def Yeah, yeah yeah. I mean we need to know that anyway to prepare the presentation in the first place. And um What was the other one. Basically, how is how is it going with your evaluation proposal. Have you got people yet for us, or what are you thinking, and when? No. Do we know did he ever say how long it was supposed to be? Mm it's gonna be a lot. But we can write a lot. I mean I think we should we should write everything. Seven pages? Oh. True. Yeah, we can n Yeah, should be good. So do you wanna write him an email then? That'd be good. Um And uh when I get home today, which will be before um before half past six, I will make that file readable, writable, everything. Uh-uh. Well I I will Well I will I will need your snippets of code or it'd be good if I had them by tomorrow evening. Oh, I was gonna ask um at the moment your search window, how is it organised? But at the beginning, it when you haven't searched yet, is it is it just is it still divided into two and the bottom half is just just empty? Okay. And then if you, I don't know, double-click on one Okay. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Hmm. Well y y this this is the icon by the way. Um, yeah, maybe you wanna do um left-handed um yeah, one left-click um highlights the the result in whatever you've got open. Which other ones? Um yeah. Usually one left click, it's highlights it cross-highlights everything, I think. Yeah. Mm well it's difficult, because Well you could look up Mm no, that's difficult. Because it the transcription window does cross-highlighting. In a very awkward way, because it has to find the topic first. That was that was a pain. And um when you when you g um right-click on a topic, it pops open the list of meetings that contain that pop po topic. And um and that works when you when you left-double-click on a topic oh, on a meeting, sorry, then it loads it. So you could you could take that for loading. So if we have that um the same on this one, at least that you if you double-left-lick, then it loads. Mm. Highlights um yeah. I mean a hi obviously highlights whatever you've clicked on here, but also highlights um Actually it's difficult, because Because you n you don't you only ever have one meeting open and those results will be op I well I suppose if you have a if you have a local search, then it could cross-highlight. Because you know, if you get back several different meetings here and you've only got one meeting open, then you can't cross out anything. Okay. What do you mean by multi-select? Mm-hmm. Oh, okay. Oh, I see what you mean, yeah. Okay. Well i i i in any case, if you left-click on on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open, then it should cross-highlight. If not, it can't. So Can you make Is it d very difficult to make another another GUI, but only for a global search? Just just take that away, the the local check-box. Because um hmm? Yeah, because in the start-up screen you can't have a Yeah, would you make that? That'd be really handy. Everything else can just stay the same, you know. In fact you can just leave everything as it is and just remove the check-box. Radio button. Mm. Okay. Are we done? Hmm. Okay.
wanna go today. Ooh. Yeah, seems slippery. What day is it? Okay. Summary. Um no. No, just the summary. No, that was just summary. No. Um no um okay. Oh, write the sum okay, right. Yeah, okay. I did I was trying to I didn't have privileges to get in to update your file. I w I actually meant to I meant to send the email and then I was just c didn't get around to it. Yeah, I had yeah, 'cause I forget mine as well, and it's just like, you know, every time put something in there. Um so yeah, I was j yeah. That was the main thing, so um as soon as that's in it'll be right out. I was making a couple of little change as well. So so those will be able to play with. Still working on the um trying to get the topics and summary search implemented as well. So that's that's sorta tonight as well. So Um yeah. Other than that it's sorta coming along. Um getting a better feel for all these NITE objects. It's just I don't know, it seems a little chaos. I don't know, it's just it's um I don't know, it's it's like if you're gonna use this stuff later on in your life, then you t spend the time to invest and learn all about them, but it's like okay, wow. What's the minimum I can get away with that that will get me what we need. So it's like, I don't know, unless I wanna do something with this in the future Yeah, right. Yeah, mm. I don't know. Anyways, so um yeah, that's my bad. I th I think I yeah. I I saw that and I'm just trying to remember if I did create it, 'cause I think I was 'cause I was trying some stuff uh a couple weeks ago, uh so that may be mine. Um Oh really? Okay. Oh yeah? Okay okay. Yeah, 'cause I saw it again today and I was just won Was that me. Yeah, I think that was me, I think so. Um but yeah, I'll yeah that was that was and sure. No. G Give you false impressions of what's hap s something's going on. Yeah, I know it. Tons, tons. All those objects, yeah. Right. How's our quota on that? What's what do actually do you know how much we have? Yeah, okay. So we probably won't have to worry about that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, exac exactly. Um I don't know. How's everything else going? Oh, yeah. Actually Do we wanna keep that? Like are we keeping that how that happens? It just prints everything out in the in the shell as well, like as it does everything, it just kinda I guess that's its default behaviour anyway. So it's just kinda doesn't really do anything. So, okay. Oh, right. Yeah. 'Kay. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I was more or less just playing with the things that had to do directly with what I was doing, so I didn't didn't take it for a full test drive yet. But uh I can do that. That's well, right after this, yeah. A lot of this Java stuff isn't though. Mm-hmm. If you if you ch if you change your window manager, it might look a little bit nicer. Just yeah. Oh yeah? Okay, right. Yeah. Yeah. Actually can we run it on Windows. Oh yeah? Okay. Were you using like a GUI builder or just all from code? Okay, and that's That's nasty. Oh yeah? Wow. Okay. Hmm. Well well can you can you connect to your home machine from here and then start it from there? Just yeah. I don't know. I've done stuff like that before, it's insane, it's insane. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Right. What was it? Well, it's kinda boring, yeah. Exactly. Hmm. Right. Oh yeah, cool. Okay, right. Or I don't know, if we have like uh a choice, so they can filter those out f the the top most common, just say okay all show all or show, you know, only the im interesting ones. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know, yeah, it doesn't really matter. Well, if we just automatically filter these out. They're boring.. Mm. Right. Yeah. Okay. Actually yeah. This is good for browsing though. It's perfect. I mean that's sorta exactly what you wanna do and look at these things. And so Yeah, who's doing what. Exactly. It's fun. Right. Yeah. Let's take 'em to the next joke. Yeah. Hmm. Right, okay. Yeah. Well it's not a real joke anyways.. Yeah. Okay, that sounds real so that's sort of implemented now or is that or is it close? Wow. Super. Okay. Like to test that. Mm. Actually Yeah. And when I update my N_L_, just uh recompile the M_ browsers and then just uh get that. Yeah. Well, so it'll use as my part as well, my um the M_ search. It w actually do we have like naming convention for s our sorts files? Just prefix 'em with an M_ and Or Yeah. Yeah. Well that's sorta what I was doing. It Like for your stuff do you have no. Oh okay, alright. It doesn't really ma no, it doesn't matter at this point. No, I was just kinda curious. I'm thinking about future stuff maybe, if Yeah, that's true too. Yeah, yeah, doesn't matter. Yeah, exactly. 'Cause Yeah. Okay. Oh yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Mm yeah right. Yeah, I know, yeah. Same here. Oh right. Super-size meeting browser.. Well, it's. I don't know. Um Just probably basic just text font, and just something nice, something solid maybe. Be a good Yeah, exactly. I know. Anybody have any um artistic talent? No? No? Ok Yeah. Oh it's possib some people are balanced. Some people are No, I know some balanced people. no. Maybe I'll check see if I can find anyone. Um Okay. How do you s add that to the to the Java programme? Is it just basic little Okay. Uh-huh, yeah. Oh. So just in the main frame. Okay. Okay, right. Right, okay. Oh, so it'll do the automatic scrunching down if it's bigger? Oh cool. Nice. Super. They know it's a distincting di distinctive experience, I guess. Yeah. Can we g Can we get sound on these machines? Yeah. I wish Actually have you ever managed N oh yeah, you must have, yeah, got play any sort of music on the DICE machines? Right, okay. Oh right right. They have them on the front too, I think. Yeah. Mm. Okay, right. Right. Damn. Yes. Yeah. Get a lot of audio. No. Okay. Um okay, well this this looks good.. Yeah. Are we gonna be uh trying to get the output from that and I don't know, still haven't found out if it's um feasible to open up more than one well, as many mm NOM objects as we can for each meeting to do like we were gonna need like figure that the ranking did make sense, like to be looking through the highest ranked ones first. So if we are gonna look through only five of them, just pick the top five to to do the the search and Since that's probably what we're looking for anyways. So Yeah. Are you serious? Maybe I'll try. Yeah? Okay. S Yeah, I'd That'd be a surprise 'cause I'm bad at Java. Yes. Um Yeah, seriously. Mm yeah. Practical Java. Yeah. How do you guys find the documentation for N_X_T_ and Yeah, okay, good. That's my belief as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Well it's still I guess research platform. Uh Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Okay. I was just curious. Well So c did we have a date for when we actually want the system done? I thought I thought we said th I thought we ch yeah, I thought we change it to the tenth or something. Um 'cause the thing is I mean we can keep working on little things f you know and sh Oh, well we should do this or do this. Should we Um so I don't know, do we want to set an actual hard deadline for like did when exactly were we gonna start the evaluation? Mm 'kay. Well we yeah, I guess well we can still come up with like test cases or whatever for for the people and just yeah, come up with scenarios, that sort of thing. I mean that's that's fairly straight-forward. And could actually be fun. Yeah, exactly. That's true, just brain-storm, yeah. Yeah.. Yeah, that's true, yeah. Yeah. Right. To work on it as well. Yeah.. No, I've I've got my D_N_L_G_ presentation on Monday. I have to read the paper. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think so. We'll probably have to talk to Steve at some point as well I guess. But um I'll probably just have a regular Tuesday meeting with him. Like we can send him an email, but I don't know if he's around even. He's not around this week, is he or that's why I think that's why we didn't have the the meeting. Yeah, 'kay. Yeah, it's true. Although do we really want the answer. S s So if we don't ask we can push it off and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's You're right, yeah. We're looking for volunteers. Yeah. Yeah, if they have time. It's hard finding people. Yeah yeah I know, but Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually some other friends of mine in different programmes might might be more willing. Have more of a break. So that might be an idea, get a range of types of people as well. Like not like highly computer lit like not, you know, Linux literate or yeah. I think that might be good, as well. Set a wider range of people. Uh no, I think like three or four maybe. Bet that would be a good yeah, I think that d No, that's that's a lot. No. Yeah, exactly. Like the thing like did an H_C_I_ course a while ago and it's just that's what these yeah, there's three people. Yeah. And that was fine. Then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. S We don't want to. Yeah, exact exact Mm visible minorities. yeah. Three or four. Oh God. Um but yeah, if he finds them, then that's cool. If he finds the people. M um Oh, writing up. Looks brilliant. Okay. Um I thought the evaluation maybe for the report. So th and that's due on the twenty fifth. Twenty fifth is is it? I is it? That's what I understood. I thought it said twen I thought he said twenty fifth. Even though it's Good Friday, I thought okay. Yeah. Oh yeah. Easter two days yeah. No. Well it wasn't originally either. So Um Yeah, okay. Okay. So that gives us two days to do the uh evaluation. No evaluation I was gonna say. And report. I didn't think so necessarily. I wouldn't I wouldn't assume. But we should ask him. Yeah, that's probably c Like, it's a good target. It's a good Yeah. Mm, right. Yeah. Actually it's fun No. No, it's it just funny that, you know, have it finish by Monday. 'Cause after Monday I'm pretty much free for about a week or so. It's like it's like if we had, you know, a bit more time. Yeah. Okay. Oh the next one, okay. See, I'm yeah I'm free this after this Monday, and it's well, why? What else uh that's that's easy compared to the other stuff. I mean I'm not even worried about that. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Oh. You didn't know that? Oh yeah. How's yours? Thank God. Okay. Maybe that was us then, not him. No actually I might have this stuff here. Schedule. Yeah, Thursday twenty fourth. Deadline for submission of final report. Oh. Well now you can. Yeah. So twenty fourth so it we sh Yep. Um just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration? Or We should have it done anyways. But okay, yeah. Sure. Hopefully, but yeah. Is is that is that a part of the demonstration, did they want that information, the evaluation as part of yep. Right. Oh right. Um there are a f a few little things. Um just made some comments the last meeting. Just general, like how it all integrates, blah blah blah, all this kind of stuff. But yeah. No. I'd expect somewhere ten to fifteen pages. Although it's fifty percent of the mark I think, is it? I think. yeah. Exactly. Well we have a bit of time to do the writing up. So that'll be good. Yeah. Just a fine-tuned or detailed and yeah. More stuff. Yeah, that could be yeah, that could easily be five or six pages. Okay. Sure. Oh yeah, sure. Yeah, no no big rush. Although just to get it out of the way. So I'll try and remember to do that to my own s Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Just basic um pretty much like the interim do you wanna do you have the interim stuff? Just um sorta like Google type thing and just um Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Then as these come up it'll just pop 'em in there. It doesn't do anything yet. S like that's that's the other big part. I mean how to get that that communication between the two different kinds of windows. Because the thing is if we have different things in here, like transcripts versus summaries versus topics, um that was why it was sorta deciding to get the three panes in there instead of just the one. Um Yeah, so so there's a couple of those little things as we Yeah, exact It's beautiful. Yeah, m M_ makes more sense. Okay. Is that how it works in the other ones? In like the other windows like the various like um if we're in the topic. Or If you have like a particular w window that you want me to mimic its behaviour, then like just find it in the programme and just say, okay, just how this one does it. So if it's like the topic window or the whatever. So then I can just sorta trace back and figure out what objects they are and bring 'em into here. So Hmm. Okay. Okay. Right. Okay. So one left click just highlights Is that? Oh just the item in The transcript or whatever it is. The If even if we could just Yeah. That should be possible. Right. Oh yeah. Although, yeah, this this will uh this is actually different from how we print it up here. Like if we're doing a global search, then we are gonna do it like how we said before and pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms. And then we'll either, you know, multi-select or, you know, choose the one we wanna actually do this wi I think multi-select would make the most sense. Well just um if there's like three of the top meetings, like like we said before, language, we're looking for the l word language and get the highest-rated ones. To actually look for the terms we're not loading it on a val of seventy six I mean or seventy five, whatever it is. Um so the r the results from that will, you know, narrow down what we're gonna use for the local search. Then we'll just do the local search on those ones that are chosen. And if we can yeah. So it it will be a bit different from from how that is right now when when we do the global search at least. Yep. Yes, yes. Exactly, yep. Okay. Hmm. Um so that we search two different Right. Yeah. That's actually fairly You know, local anyways, yeah. No, that's easy. Sure, yep. That's that's quite t straight-forward. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Well it it kinda makes sense. It would be kinda cool Actually, are we bothering with our topic stuff still? Or is that sorta gone like our own topic segment. Like since we can't do the labelling and all the rest. We are still doing our topic segment? Well you are you are, I guess. Okay. But we're not gonna be we won't be l doing a global search on the topics for our topics, since they don't have labels. Probably? Okay. La label all the label ones I'll open 'em. Yeah, all the label twos, yeah. I don't know. Okay. Mm. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Well no, it will be kind of straight-forward. Like if you're creating if you're creating X_M_L_ files of this Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Yep. Right. Mm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Probably not. I mean just get work done. I think that's what I've gotta do. Yeah.
Ooh, there you go. Doesn't wanna stay. Yeah. No it won't. Yeah. The fun and games. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Seems unlikely. It's an Excel s S_X_ dot X_S_L_. Doesn't st have anything in it, Oh, it does, it has about three lines of X_M_L_ that didn't do much, I think. Yeah. What's that? It just seems to be occupied. The place is alright, doesn't matter really. There's plenty in there. I had lots of stuff in there yesterday that Did you see? Loads of stuff. Oh no, they live there, but there's I had even more stuff there yesterday. I was unzipping all this kind of crazy huge things that were enormous. I needed them, they were for this though. It's alright, but uh Yeah, it's uh it's about yeah, it's so I think there's about eight gigs on there. So yeah, it's no problem. It's just much bigger than all of our home directories combined, isn't it?. Yeah. I had a play with it um yesterday. Uh no, it was good really. Yeah, I liked it. Um uh it uh generated a lot of exceptions in the background. But they didn't cause any problems, but it just Uh yeah, I didn't discover any of those, yeah. I did have a look. I prodded it to see if it'd break, but it didn't break too m I didn't play that long, but um it seemed alright really, yeah. And it the the th the start-up's great, looks quite good, looks alright. And so yeah, yeah. No, looked alright. The only the only thing is the it's not the start-up screen is not too pretty. But uh the the s It doesn't matter too much. No, it's not it's not it's not a um it's not the top priority, is it. Yeah. I think it'd look better on Windows as well actually. 'Cause um it Java uses the native Windows, doesn't it? So Yeah. But we don't No. Do they? Yeah.. Well the um the um speaker characterisation is finished. I haven't done it, I haven't updated all those object files though 'cause it takes ages on these computers. So I do it it's faster for some bizarre reason if I log in at home and then run the code. It runs it much faster than if I do it here. But But that's why I just can't to sit in the lab and wait half an hour or whatever it takes Yeah. No, I tried that, but l yeah. It'll really speed it up. Yeah. Yeah. I saw that, yeah. I saw that it it doe it's tells tells you what speakers uh are in which meeting and then you can see which topics which topics yeah, something like that, yeah. Yeah. The um th the dialogue acts are all done, and they're quite amusing some of them. But there's some of them some of th the thing actually what I wanted to talk about dialogue acts was um there are some that occur all the time that I just and I don't know how interesting there are. So the fir one statement is that it will b I'd removed it 'cause w it was like everything is prefixed by statement. Every single dialogue act starts with statement and um so everybody's top statement. So it So I got rid of that. And then everybody the next one seems to mostly be back-channel. Well I don't know what that means. Who knows what back-channel. Is that what that means? Oh, keep that then. Um and then the others are quite Yeah. Some people don't though. There are some people who don't do that. Actually yeah, you can see that they don't do that and it's the bottom of their list. Yeah. I know. Some people have and acknowledgement is a big one that comes up all the time, yes no questions. Um uh what else comes up? Yeah. But that's the thing and so I wanted to know whether or not we 'cause at the moment you can get there's a method that will just give you the top five for or the top X_. You give it any number and it will give you the top whatever for each person. And then each meeting knows about all the different dialogue acts for each person in the meeting, and the amount that that occurred, and will give you that in top order as well, or will give you or you can just search for each specific dialogue act. Do you have to search on in B_s and K_s rather than real words right at the moment. But I can change that. Um so I don't know what we want to display. That's what I m That's what I'm asking you really. All's a lot, all's like twenty five Dialogue acts per b Yeah. I think we should have the global top five that cause it each speaker's got top a top whatever, and so just say one of the boxes just explains does this is my top five dialogue acts for the speaker, and then in the meeting you have what you could either have the most commonly occurring ones or you could have a list of each speaker's top dialogue acts. Either of those would do you. But it would start take a lot of space if you have it Or you could have no, you don't need that. So you s 'cause it's 'cause it's a speaker window, the speaker characterisation window comes up. So you've got the global one there, and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting. And then then the top five in that meet in global, the top five this meeting, and then the rest is r obvious, isn't it. Yeah. That occur. But you th some often the interesting ones don't occur, things like joke don't occur very often. Well they do sometimes, but they're not that common. One guy has top five joke. One of them is joke. He's an undergrad. That's quite funny. Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? Yeah. He's the joker. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. That'd be quite good, wouldn't it? Yeah. What percentage of the dialogue acts that he makes are jokes, in the meeting and globally separately, so once globally. Yeah. Um I think most things are coded with a dialogue act. A lot of them are coded with Z_, which means no label. So I just ignored that as well. 'Cause that's boring. And statement, which is boring. And also the other thing that they have is um if somebody quotes something, so if I quote a joke to you they separate that. So they put they put the the dialogue act and then they put a double a colon and they put that aside. Just ignored anyth any quoted material, 'cause it's got nothing to do with I just scrapped it. Yeah yeah yeah, somebody else's joke. So yeah, you have to be original about your material. Otherwise we don't credit it to you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's all done, yeah. All done, yeah. Um yeah, I just have to I'll just finish there might be some polishing. I can't remember. But I think it's pretty much complete done. So I'll do that tonight. Just put it up there. So you can us start using that whenever. No, I just well it's called meeting and speaker. Well, I can judge it if you want. Yeah. We could put it in a sep in a p package. If you can be bothered. Well it doesn't seem to make any differ I've never ever used Java packages. Doesn't even make any difference. As long as in the same directory it works. So sod it. Right. Well then you can double-click on and it oh, oh. No. Yeah, it will have something else. Just borrow a little Microsoft GIF like that. M_B_. Where have I seen that before. Yeah. Yeah, anything you like, yeah. Do you think we'd be doing uh M_S_C_s in Informatics if we did? Some people do, yeah. Yeah. That's really easy. You do it in um one of the w whatever the main is it you set w GIF or some Set f set set picture or something. It's really simple. Yeah, I think you just give it a file-name and it tells it it knows Yeah, yeah, it just sticks it in the corner. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It could even have some sound when it comes on. It go welcome to the meeting browser. No, that's problem. Have to do it in the Not no, but I think if you put headphones in, it will just play just normally. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes it works, yeah. Yeah. I still can't make it run T_N_T_ from Java. Yeah, you try it. If you can make it work, then I'll be well chuffed. It's a Java course. Course, yeah. Right. Yeah, I think it was So what does. Yeah. And it uh it's was apparently generated by going to d generate JavaDoc and it just went Spat it all out and they never bothered to uh d comment anything. Yeah. At least get to know what methods are there. So without having to look at the source codes. Yeah, yeah. What? Yes, that's it right here. Today, wasn't it? It's the eighth. Okay. Don't know. Maybe it's just a day, I don't know. Send him an email. He'll probably re-do it anyway. So Yeah w He said he might he would try. Yeah. Hmm. So how many people do we uh try and 'cause it Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, it'll take forever, and then you gotta analyse the results. No no no no no, forget it. Yeah, but one computer scientist one l and one dude off the street. Yeah, one man, one woman, yeah. Yeah. Two weeks. Two two two weeks today. Yeah. When's the report hand-in? Is oh right, is that th is that the Friday? The twenty fourth then. Yeah. Yeah yeah, that's Good Friday. Yeah. Mm. oh we should have it we should try and have at it done by then anyway, I think. Otherwise it will start to getting b bit tight otherwise. We should aim to be finished by Monday, this Monday coming. A week no yeah well, basically for Tuesday. Start the evaluation t pretty much straight-away and then get Get s yeah, and then get um We have to write the report, yeah, and everything. We have to write everything. Yeah. S_P_ two. And you must have your research proposal. Is that in on the eighteenth? Shit. I've not done at all, yeah. Hmm. Yeah, you have to start again. It's just do topics instead of seg yeah, you have to get the topics out instead of the segments. Uh yeah. To you're gonna be able to do a global search for topics? Is that what you mean, yeah? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, I didn't think you'd bother with that, but yeah, cool. I didn't think we're gonna bother with that. But yeah. Yeah, it does, isn't it. Yeah. Yeah. What? With Well we'll certainly do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on the Yeah, but at at the very least. No. Exactly. Yeah. Uh yeah. No, we won't be doing that. Well yeah, even if even if I happen to manage to make it decent keywords, I don't think we can expect you to also come up with the search thing for it as well. So Would, yeah. But if I collate yeah. Yeah, if I create X_M_L_ files, but if I m I'm not gonna do that. Um I did have a look at trying to create X_M_L_ files. It did look like a quite a a mission really. I suppose it's not it's it's as straightforward as writing in X_M_L_ files. But it's but it's organising the segment data though. It would just looks so complicated to get it from the um from a plain text file back into organise it by who which speaker speaks what and how n doing the segment I think that was the stupidest way they could ever have organised the whole thing if you ask me. But Organise it by time not by speaker. But yeah. But So I don't know really what we're gonna do about that. Yeah, we don't. Do we need another meeting this week? Mm. Mm.
Forget every time that the Where did my oh, it's it's stuck here. Yeah. Okay. Keep an eye if I'm dropping this 'cause just seem ah, as I said, it doesn't seem very s Perhaps sweater, or maybe if I set it here on the this brand thing. Are they on, yeah. On. Okay. What? Was that a answer?. Well Okay. I was just about to You could change your project. Do a P_H_D_ or uh yeah. I haven't created it. I I do Yeah. Shoulda run the I_L_ in that directory. Yeah. Sounds good. Oh.. It's good thing. Yeah.. Yeah. I'll do it. Hey Zoe. It's good. Who? What? Okay. It's just very quiet. Oh. Yeah. It's like I'm only interested in this guy, 'cause he seems to be funny. So what is it. Like instead of the Oh. We have the g big yellow one maybe. No Huh? Yeah. Yeah, that would be good. Ah no. Oh. Yeah. We have to remember to include that in our evaluation, how they did the GIF improve your browsing experie Sorry. I guess that's why we have a separate speech lab. Yeah. Yeah, um 'Kay. Yeah. Yeah. I ran in some troubles with the indexing, but uh f found another package I instead of writing it from um the scratch, 'cause it well, I don't know um just now, but I haven't played around it that much. But We'll see what happens in the next few days. Yeah we'll think about that. I can send you right now. Like Um C_. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't expect this course to be so much about Java. But uh feels like it's it's a Java course more than anything else. It's just like Yeah.. So We change it to Friday. Yeah. I guess that's not Yeah. No. So we Yeah, that would be more reasonable. 'Cause the I_L_ is Friday. What? Oh yeah, you have your presenta Right, whatever. It's too much now. Well but yeah, Monday we'll try and do Monday. Um I mean we could Should we meet up Monday? Or Should we Yeah. Just sh like w Yeah. Just Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well so he's supposed to give us test subject. Did he say that or what? Okay. 'Cause we're gonna get an email on our uh M_S_C_ list saying from Steve, we need volunt yeah. Yeah. Well th they gonna u need us. They're gonna need us for like perception projects and things like that. So yeah. We need to use each other for those Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And then one's supposed to be a woman. And one's supposed be a man. And one, I don't know. Oh yeah. Yeah, okay. Should we just yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's Tuesday the twenty second. Yeah. I think so. Well uh What? Oh, it's a Thursday. Yeah. So it's not the yeah. It's not a good Friday if if that's It's not a good Friday if it's a deadline. No. Can have a look. The report, yeah. No, okay. Oh. No, we p I thought we would. Oh. Yeah. Oh we have three? S_P_ two. Aren't you? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. In our uh timeline we r put in twenty fifth and that's the Friday I think. Yeah. I'm just that's why I'm trying to find his his dates. Whatever. We're planning on having a big party on the twenty fourth. So End of lectures. Oh, it's actually twenty fourth. Yeah. Did he say anything about like h what he expects of the final report and stuff? Like length or Only I mean how long we're this One, two Yeah. 'Cause this I mean We have interim report of seven pages, and that's we can y yeah. We could p probably just expand that. I mean 'cause it I mean a lot of it's gonna be the same thing. Yeah. And then I mean write about the evala evaluation and stuff. That's gonna be quite a few pages. But So I don't think page is gonna be problem. But uh Mm. Can I have it? Well, the one meeting. Um it should be fairly simple to just get the topics and the summaries fro using that text extractor thingy you wrote, Ray. You just like or Yeah. Excuse me. I just realised I haven't done that part yet. To have for the start-up. Oh. To have for the start-up. Uh-huh. Yeah g uh that was li like yeah, if I'll make a just index What? Well I I mean I I'm f it's not first priority maybe, but don't know. But uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess we just see what Steve says about the re-evaluation and then like we'll keep in touch by email if we need anything. I guess we will see you on Thursday. And Monday. D_N_L_G_. We can just email if we need other I guess. Hooray. Okay.",EN2002d
