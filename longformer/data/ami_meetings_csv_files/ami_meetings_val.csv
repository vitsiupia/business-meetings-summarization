"mm ' kay . mm - hmm . yeah the universal ones . yeah . yeah . mm - hmm , it ' s about that . mm . um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . as you said they come with the t_v_ so it ' s normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , so maybe we could think about colour ? make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , you know those things ? because we always lose our remote control . okay . mm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . yeah . then you lose it , yeah . kind of um , maybe more like a p_d_a_ kind of , just hand held , like , ' cause yeah . no , i wasn ' t , no sorry i wasn ' t thinking of the screen of like a p_d_a_ but okay . so you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? yep . okay . mm - hmm . okay . oh no , . sorry it ' s okay . okay , cool . uh , making a profit of fifty million euros . so , it ' s go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . yeah . yeah . yeah , i was thinking that as well , i think the the only ones that i ' ve seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they ' re , yeah . so presumably that might be an idea to put into . yeah , yeah . uh ' cause i mean , what uh twenty five euros , that ' s about i dunno , fifteen pounds or so ? and that ' s quite a lot for a remote control . uh - huh . mm - hmm . okay . the the keyrings , yeah yeah . okay , that ' s cool . okay . okay . ' kay . so , we ' re looking for ' kay . we ' re sorry , carry on . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . okay . for for uh remember we ' re trying to make it for twelve euros fifty . okay well right we ' ll have to um i ' ll we ' re k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh , oh actually , no , we ' ll allocate . so you do the looking around at other remote controls . um , if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into um basically how how it ' s made i_e_ like how you make it all in one , how what sort of materials are available to you whatever . and obviously , other instructions will come from the personal coach . which will probably just usurp what i said so shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive . uh . and you look at competition and design . cool . so we have uh um . okay , groovy . and no doubt we ' ll get um sorry . we ' ll get um warnings for next meetings as well . okay . i shall i can ' t imagine these are worth much . okay . fashion into electronic . okay . alright so twenty five . so yeah , i ' ve the only the only remote controls i ' ve used usually come with the television , and they ' re fairly basic . so uh mm . but but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . for sure . yeah , yeah . right . uh , what do we think a what do we think a good size would be for this ? ' cause i i know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there ' s just like a hundred buttons on it , or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily . right . okay . wait for emails ? hmm . slim . uh yeah uh , being as a marketing exper expert i will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ? what are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? what speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market . so before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like and apart from this , it should be having a good look also , because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their c_d_ player , m_p_ three player like any electronic devices . they really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , so , yes , all this . yeah . yep . uh . hmm .","the group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design . they discussed making a universal remote with a locator function . they also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface . the project manager instructed the marketing expert to examine competitors ' remotes , the user interface designer to research possible shapes and colors , and the industrial designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device .",ES2005a
"how ' re we placed in terms of the alright . it fell that ' s why . ah . sure . mm . i ' m ron . i uh once upon a time studied in victoria and i am the user interface designer . go for it . alright . think i ' m just gonna put down one uh one c_d_ . anybody ? no ? no ? afro beat orchestra , very cool . yeah . fift s they like fifteen members from brooklyn . um and i ' m hoping to go to the concert in belgium , in brussels in april first . yeah . it ' s supposed to be in brussels anyways . um thing i love about edinburgh love um i just came from glasgow and i ' m um happy to say that there ' s the there ' s the same quantity approximately . um . i w does uh yeah . ready ? minging ? nice . uh - huh . nice . nice . i assume that we ' re building a stand alone uh remote control , we can ' t kind of build it into other uh products . for instance like a mobile phone or something like that . or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ? yep . okay . mm - hmm . nice . hot . now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ? s does anybody have any initial ideas ? but i ' m thinking i ' m thinking kind of p_d_a_ uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things . too confusing . mm - hmm . possibly . i ' m pretty sure there is . i mean i i have a friend who has a p_d_a_ that he just points at his telev any television he wants and it ' ll figure out the the specifications of it and will control it um so i th i assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world . oh . i like the idea of the uh multi plate . in in i like . we should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well . for those cold winter days . well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it . if you ' re not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either well there used to be those whistling devices but that ' s a little bit annoying . th yeah . that ' s cool . i think we could design into that . curves . we ' re talking twenty five pounds or twenty five euros ? slight difference i guess . no . thank you . guess i should probably try to sit up straight . oh , i think mine ' s fallen off . wow . oh yeah , that ' s fine . right . i ' m nathan , i ' m from california , and i ' m here doing a masters degree in social anthropology . u_c_l_a_ . yeah . okay . mm - hmm . wow . no . sounds nice . oh , wow . there ' s more vomit there . alright . yep . um let ' s see . yeah , that ' s the music i grew up listening to . and so there something i miss about my hometown . burritos that cost less than eight pounds . i grew up in san diego , but yeah um la jolla , p_b_ . but really uh i last lived in san francisco , i haven ' t lived in cali well i haven ' t lived in southern california since i was eighteen . it ' s different . ' cause in san diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern california they steam them . yeah , it really does . mm . yeah . where you from in san diego ? okay . yeah , my grandparents lived on um thirty second . close t uh do you know where clare de lune coffee shop is , and cafe forte cool . yeah . wow . okay . mm . sounds interesting . maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that . yeah . maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . yeah . yeah . s smaller ' s better . simple . oh right . that ' d be different . yeah . it ' s gonna be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things . needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes . right . i think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality . mm . something , uh we ' ll have to come up with a name , patent it . leopard print . i think , it wouldn ' t be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . mm . true . yeah . i think so . yeah . mm . yeah . yeah . ' s true . okay . alright . like that ? okay , cool . okay ? right , so i ' m just gonna start this powerpoint real quick . yeah , powerpoint . yeah , well , you know , . yeah i kinda like this i ' m kinda getting into it . right . um . so just to kick off the meeting basically um so we ' re working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it right . just got an agenda to set out what we ' re gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . um we ' re gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we ' re gonna start talk a little bit about tool training . essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven ' t tried out yet , the whiteboard . um we ' ve got a general plan for the project how we ' re gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . um i guess you know game or something um in real life um so yeah basically i want to i ' m just gonna you got of course you can discuss that , i ' m thinking about um uh proposing that since we ' ve got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don ' t ask , don ' t tell . um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um y is exactly . um i mean obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn ' t like if i ' m like we ' re gonna sell a remote control that ' s the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn ' t seem like such a good idea because of x_ obviously go with it . i mean we ' ll discuss it but i ' m not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like yeah yeah exactly so , ' cause we ' re what we ' re sort of role playing is y g yeah you ' re gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um . and that ' s the same for your when we do introductions i mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um uh you know maybe i you ' re like in maine you went to u_c_s_b_ but you wanna say you went to harvard or something like that , why not , you know you can this is you know i guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . so are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ? sweet . cool . so i guess that that we ' re totally we ' re making a remote control which is thrilling um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model i dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life i dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website . um we ' ve got to make something as fashionable as possible , that ' s kind of the corporate strategy is we ' re gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like john lewis nice or you know if you go to debenham ' s or something . so um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . um way we ' re gonna go about doing that is basically at first we ' re gonna start on the basics . and that ' s where i ' m gonna need you guys the user interface designers and the um um the other designer that i can ' t remember , the the i_d_ and the u_i_d_ right um the industrial designer hey right on alright , getting into it um to guide me and guide us on this project ' cause you ' re gonna be you ' re g you guys are the bottom you know you ' re like no you can ' t do that you can ' t have you know x_ and y_ um at the same time . and then um we ' ll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um i i think you guys probably got the same emails i did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it ' s also better if it ' s not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . um and so we ' ll work up from there and um then we ' ll meet on and talk about it and then finally we ' ll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what ' s possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the u_i_d_ and the i_d_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up . so that ' s the detailed design . so it ' s a three stage kind of thing . um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , i haven ' t tried it yet either um i ' m just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down i ' m just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five c_d_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um . oh , we skipped introductions . nice . i ' m a excellent project manager . um . i ' m marty , um i went to uni at uh u_c_ santa barbara and i ' m here working on a p_h_d_ in psychology . um yeah . so expert don ' t play yourself down . expert where did you go to uni nathan ? oh brilliant . cool . my little brother goes there . right so desert island discs . yeah . well i ' ll t i no no yeah i ' m just gonna write a couple of ' em down . see i ' m a big music fan i don ' t know if you guys are , i ' m assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent but there ' s some other options , if you ' re a t_v_ slut like i am like smallville terrible television show but i happen to love it , it ' s rubbish but i love it . t the the main c the main character ? wow . is he a wanker ? he looks really tall , like he ' s gotta be like six six . yeah . um okay so i really like jeff buckley . you guys heard of jeff buckley ? um that ' s cool ' cause like not very many people have . um and um oh well i might as well throw a british person in there um you can ' t go wrong with radiohead . it ' s a r okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises i think . it ' s kinda weird . anyway yeah . yeah , you ' re like press and it ' s . kinda cool . you ' ll see . alright so um whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want . right on . w mm . nice . okay yeah yeah . well yeah . oh , family guy . isn ' t h has h do you watch the new season ? i think i ' m gonna start downloading it yeah . mm - mm . afro beat orchestra ? very cool . mm . wow . that ' s what a powerpoint presentation is for . it ' s they ' re designed specifically to ignore . i it ' s th brilliant . ah yes yes yes okay i see that . vomit . yes . street pizza . it ' s so brilliant . i ' ve seen more urine in this city than ever before , i mean it ' s so minging . uh . i ' m going local . going local . i have to be here for three years so i might as well get the terminology right . oh , have you been home yet ? they ' ll be like , say something british , and you ' re like oh shut up family . right you s you ' re gonna stay here ? wow . bad religion ? yeah yeah , yeah . well yeah that ' s why yeah . i miss coffee . burritos . oh yeah two two bucks . where are you from in california by the way ? did you really ? what part ? yeah i ' m from san diego as well . yeah oh man . going to s like north carol i ' m sorry you you just can ' t get a better burrito than what ' s available in the s in san diego . well it ' s it ' s i there ' s other things too there ' s you just can ' t place it like i when i went to school in the u_ in santa barbara which is central california the mexican food is okay , it ' s just not good like and yeah it ' s like two bucks , like literally two bucks for this massive i miss yeah good call on that . um just literally just metropolitan san diego , i live like five minutes from the zoo . so north park actually if you want to get real specific . yep . yes . on university , yeah . yeah it ' s actually like literally half a mile from my house . yeah , pretty cool . small world as we were discussing before . especially when we ' re all from the same general region . right so okay , success on the whiteboard . you can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our c_d_s and things we like about the city you know , i think we ' ll um right so moving on to not fun stuff uh project finance . um basically what we ' re trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five euros . um . this is what the finance department has told me , the c_f_o_ but i don ' t know , i ' m not sold on this , it ' s pretty dear , i mean twenty f that ' s like you know forty bucks for a remote . it would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we ' re gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million euros on it . eur internationally . so um one of the things i i was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . um so something that could do n_t_s_c_ as well as pal as well as various other formats like if it ' s gonna control d_v_d_s but um you know i ' ll leave that to you guys but that ' s something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing . um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty . so we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can . um s right so um just to close up , i ' m not sure how much time i ' ve used mm next time right project manager , sorted . um . is uh we ' ll meet in another half an hour or so um and i ' d like the um industrial designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . um u_i_d_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you ' ll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . um mm basic and um so i need you to tell us what um we what the user ' s gonna want . so actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user ' s gonna want and what the user can have , you know like uh so yeah well it is and we ' ll discuss the trade - offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email . but i think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um and as more things come up we ' ll have meetings and you ' ll get emails and so forth . um any questions , before we get started ? you mean to like hmm . yeah . well , have a think about it . i mean i ' m i ' m certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it ' s certainly do - able isn ' t it . i mean um or if we can ' t have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function . the clapper . no i mean no , good idea , good idea . we ' ll see what see what uh - huh y i like that yeah . that ' s true , i guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to um i don ' t really have any . let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . uh project announcement . ts ts ts yeah . not so much . all right we ' ll find them , we ' re on our own . yeah yeah let ' s do it , let ' s do . i ' m gonna go ahead and take notes on this too ' cause yeah i mean oh yeah right . so initial ideas . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah that ' s slick isn ' t it . i mean like stylist yeah like a just a yeah . right so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect . um so we ' ve got this kind of an idea of a trade - off between um uh size and functionality . um and we also i ' m also gonna note for future reference this idea of um so you like maybe like an l_ like a touch screen type of remote ? i don ' t think one exists . be a good idea . yeah all the other universal remotes . um i don ' t know if there ' s such a thing out there , i guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi - format like um you know pal , n_t_s_c_ , region one okay . okay . interesting . okay . okay . okay . um all right . so . i li i ' m liking that idea , this idea of a touch screen remote with multi - format features . um . um . let ' s see . mm . uh let ' s see . um . yeah yeah okay . think they ' re just called face plates ? i don ' t know . um . mm . but if we ' re bundling it unless we ' re selling their telly with the remote . um cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes , could we do something like that ? um yeah i think this material quality as well like i guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know apple ' s been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of you know yeah . yeah . we do have the minimum am amount i mean we were talking finances i dunno , selling a a forty pound remote would h or a forty dollar remote , twenty five euro remote would be pretty you know it ' s pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that ' s black and you know m massive , some kind of i dunno a balance there in somewhere . but um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we ' re gonna sell it and um mm . twenty five euros . yeah . they ' re all weaker than they ' re all stronger than the dollar . although , computer parts , all if you ' re gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the states . like um do you guys know fry ' s ? huge computer uh electronics store ? they serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in america and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty pounds about . right so um let ' s go ahead and wrap that up here for now , i ' m gonna put these initial ideas that we ' ve got in the um project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we ' ve talked about um the different you know kind of trade - offs that we ' ve got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . and uh right so thanks for that . let ' s just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into . um . yes . thanks guys . are you sure i got it all head ' s kinda small . okay . we ' re okay ? we ' re good ? i guess it ' s gonna be hard to drink coffee . mm . uh okay . very official . you ' re just gonna believe me , we ' ll go from there . fair enough . prove it yeah , okay . works for me . there you go . i ' m sarah , i went to michigan , and i ' m here doing cultural studies and i ' m the marketing manager or something . marketing , yeah expert . expert . fine . that ' s me . so . so do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us ? i ' m waiting to know . uh fair enough . oh , smallville . i went to high school with tom willing actually . the guy . yeah . yeah . very much so . hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless . yeah . he is a big guy . yeah . mm - hmm . good call . interesting . i guess i ' ll go next then . okay . don ' t wanna lose all my mikes , plugged in here . okay . this is basically just pen practice huh ? okay . oh you ' re much taller than me so i ' m gonna write down here . um . right now i ' m listening to a lot of somebody nobody ' s ever heard of , chris bathgate , local michigan folk singer , really lame and uh uh what else did i bring with me ? probably classical , to totally geek it out , yeah i think . and my family guy d_v_d_s but we don ' t need to write that one down . so yeah . no . are you getting it online , or is it on sky ? yeah , that ' d be nice . ' fraid not . mm . exciting . that ' d be . oh . i didn ' t even read those . oops . i shouldn ' t admit that . yeah . it ' s the five by five , i can ' t read that much . yeah oh it ' s so horrible . oh my god . seriously ? it really is yeah . slide it in there . yeah . yeah fair enough . i ' ve already got more than i can keep track of . and i ' m gonna go home next week and everyone ' s gonna be like oh my god you ' re turning into one of those people , no . i know . i know . oh it should be interesting . wait until i tell them i ' m not coming back . they ' re gonna love that one . probably . or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide . ' cause nice . of course . oh , now i can think of so many other ones . that ' s how it works . mm . oh any thing that are like free . nice . it must make all the difference . ah . right . mm . there you go . mm . makes sense . uh . what they ' re looking for . and negotiate that . uh . i don ' t think there ' s any rules about it yet . so yeah . mm . w yeah . i like the little cover thingies . hmm . good idea . start your minutes . um well it ' s pretty much given it ' s gonna be universal right , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that i was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing , but then , i ' ve never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons , you can ' t tell what they do . yeah . specific . okay . interesting . true . mm . mm . right . we want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you ' re not gonna be able to tell them apart , that whole yeah . hmm . mm . an interesting option . yeah . definitely . right . that yeah . awesome . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . keeping it nice and slick , would be important . and i don ' t know , like , there ' s such a problem with losing them , that adding this whole like p_d_a_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , so we ' re gonna have to be careful with what like just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool . yeah . fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ? isn ' t there a name for them ? are they ? i dunno . yeah . something really cool . leopard print or something . hmm . true . right . true . right . right . right . probably . good . mm . yeah . and that titanium the new silver sleek ones that ' s last couple of years , very much so . mm . right . right . mm . definitely . yeah . or if you our users in mind , like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let ' s design , no it ' s they ' re used to the buttons so we ' ll have to be careful of exactly who we ' re marketing this to , and who we ' re gonna be able to get it out of . but euros . mm . mm - mm . mm . okay . with half an hour ? ' kay . perfect . cool .","the project manager presented the project to the other participants by discussing the aim of creating a new , fashionable remote control device and defined the roles and tasks of each participant . the group introduced themselves to each other and trained themselves how to use the whiteboard tools . the project manager discussed the financial goals of the project , including the projected profit aim and price point for the device . the project manager gave each participant their assignments . the group then began a discussion of their initial ideas about the remote control and possible features . the project manager announced that he would make a report containing the discussion of the group ' s initial ideas about the device .",ES2009a
"oh no . no n i i already did it . it ' s not much . it ' s just one question . yeah . no that ' s that ' s for the trendy uh feel and look . so yeah , b but i think the battery option . oh . oh no . yeah . but we don ' t have any basic options any more . yeah we c could we only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . everything you can do with with the menu . so with the display . yeah . so you do one inte you can do one integrated scroll - wheel push - button . and then just drop all the other buttons . but but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push - buttons . yeah . so we have to to make it s uh more uh it has to be could drop the speech recognition . we we d yeah . yeah . we lose our whole concept . uh so no we just we keep the l_c_d_ . yeah . if we do uh two integrated scroll - wheel push - buttons , we can drop all the the push - buttons . with with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . with the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera . no it ' s three euros . no ? um no it ' s it ' s n yeah . yeah yeah yeah . it ' s the let ' s make the let ' s make the case plastic . yeah . but plastic with a with a special colour . a woo wood uh wood uh wood colour . that ' s an option . yeah . so we do one one s yeah . hmm . no the buttons , those are really needed . yeah th th it ' s it ' s uh an advanced chip - on - print . oh that but the but the integrated uh button ? how many func functions can it uh have ? okay . oh no . no no , it has to be um curved . okay . okay . wh what we could do is um drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons . yeah . just something else than than black or white i think . yeah . the display the but if you have to power the for ten minutes , then the yeah . no no it has to be curved . yeah . just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something . yeah or spe special form ? yeah . yeah . but it ' s it ' s for the integrated button , i think also . or yeah . okay . yeah . yep . oh just oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . okay . yeah . okay . yep . two or three . two or three . yeah . yeah . or give it a colour . yeah true one . yeah . it hides uh basic functions . yeah true . i think we are it ' s in oh yeah it was integrateds . yeah . can you uh change channels directly with with just one button ? no , you have to scroll through the menu , before yeah . so it ' s it ' s not no . yeah . oh no . seven . yeah . five . five . yep . yeah . i think a two . no . yep . no you got a plastic . yeah . yeah . you only have one yeah . four . yeah . red . mm yeah yeah . it ' s the white part uh yeah . we have a we have a mm - hmm . ah i and that you only have to control one button . it gives visual feedback . so i think a five . five . okay . yeah . yeah that looks uh great . yeah . nah yep . yeah . s yep . wow . no we put the electronics into the fashion . yeah , four is okay . okay . three plus ?

it ' s just one yeah . uh that ' s the infrared uh thing . yeah . yeah . yeah . um , uh it ' s just a scroll yeah , is it ' s horizontal or vertical ? i think yeah . yeah , yeah . yes . it doesn ' t look like uh uh it it ' s it ' s not yeah . it ' s not very fashionable anymore . but uh it ' s okay . yeah . maybe m make it bigger ? or yeah . that looks little bit more uh maybe that ' s a s a special colour for it . so we can make it uh special ? or or speckles in it ? i dunno . uh i ' m not sure . yeah red is already a special colour , i think . so it ' s not very special , but uh yeah . just uh put the purple uh purple on it . that ' s trendy . woah . oh yeah . hmm . oh what ? ? oh no . no no . yeah . oh it ' s it ' s just one computer ? or no . but can we delete it , just with delete ? or crashed . oh , no . okay . yeah , over here . hmm ? what ' s this ? oh yeah . oh that ' s the select button . it ' s uh no , it looks it ' s okay . specially the the r_ . d designed by okay . no . do they have a lo oh , the here . this i this is the logo . two r_s and a one . yeah . okay . are we uh ready ? uh or is this uh the last assignment ? or final um bug . bug . no it ' s in inside the no it oh . hey , you ' ve got it uh read only . so you have to uh . it ' s too uh it is it ' s now single curved . so it ' s flat . oh no . okay . it doesn ' t matter . it ' s it ' s that ' s the detector uh for the okay . yeah . i don ' t know . maybe that ' s why it ' s it ' s not working , because it ' s more yeah . oh . oh yeah . yeah . you ' ve to make it s uh ninety degrees . you have oh we ' re always long . yeah , can we t can we get to that i oh it ' s not working anymore . oh yeah yeah yeah yeah , it ' s it ' s working , it ' s working . yeah . we ' re improving uh yeah . yeah . no it so cake . no . no . yeah . yeah . especially after the first meeting . and yeah . yeah yeah yeah . yeah . yeah but only the the financial parts uh yeah . yeah . finish meeting . i think the powerpoint is is too limited . you can ' t uh draw easy in in powerpoint . it has to be uh yeah . the drawing board has to be integrated into powerpoint , so that you can just easily yeah . yeah just for text , for text it ' s uh it ' s okay . but ' kay . okay . oh . okay . did you do your questionnaire already ? uh it wants yeah but everything is . just a normal battery then , yeah . oh my goodness . well i guess i we ' ll have to go for single curve then . i mean we have to drop on everything . yeah . how about sorry . that ' s what i was thinking . a a and uh ' cause then they don ' t have to n they don ' t need special colour as well . that was exactly my point . like let ' s drop all the buttons , and just make one i mean we ' re gonna use the l_c_d_ screen anyway . so we ' ll just have to use it for everything . and then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click yeah we need one integrated button for everything then . yeah . kind of . i was because yeah . if you if you go to if you go to our uh view , like you if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance , this is just uh an example , y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example . but you want a sound preview of how it ' s gonna sound , right ? so you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . so you ' ll you ' ll need a a kind of a joystick uh button . yeah . exactly . yeah it ' s r yeah . no . no but yeah it ' s it ' s expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . ' cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons . i no . yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works . we uh we we haven ' t really integrated this the speech into the system , so we can might as well s drop that . we need to lose some buttons . which that ' s even yeah , if you if you go to eight i don ' t know how to yeah , we need the chip for the for the l_c_ display . yeah . true . oh . hmm . yeah uh you uh uh yeah . so the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and which can use a regular chip , wh which is six euros in total . that doesn ' t matter . well yeah . exactly . yeah but the uh can ' t we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push - button ? ' cause that will save us one and a half euro already . and then if w th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ? and uh yeah d at l yeah . at least one for power . oh . yeah it ' s just as expensive as what we have now . yeah endlessly . i mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . you can go into you in you main menu , you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options . yeah . maybe we should . ' cause we don ' t have money and w we want the screen . i guess we have to . we ' ll we ' ll be on yeah it says right here . yeah . but we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . damn . yeah and then yeah yeah yeah yeah . well , you only have to power it up when you wanna use it . i don ' t know . . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . that ' s the most import we only have yeah but well we come back to the drawing board then , huh ? it ' s silly ' cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . oh yeah ? okay . drop everything . yeah . we went straight into finance ? for yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . i think it does . because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of l_c_d_ , right ? yeah . well , we have extended menus , on the on the l_c_d_ screen . so i no . yeah . yeah alright . yeah yeah . definitely one . it has to be . you ' re not gonna find them . yeah the next not so much so . yeah . yeah it ' s uh it ' s integrated . e exactly just like a m mobile . . well uh we should b build it so that if you don ' t kind of push into the menu or something , if when it ' s on , yeah , it ' s turned on , it automatically has the the programme and the volume function , but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some of you or you double click it . no because it has four arrows , right ? oh yeah . yeah i was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick . say . yeah that is a bummer . we ' ll make it a morse code . yeah . yeah i would go for five or six , yeah . okay five . let ' s not diss our remote . yep . just one button . but uh yep . we still have the fruit and vegetable print . fr oh i mean the oh never mind . i ' m a bit lost . . it ' s way more practical , yeah . yeah . yeah . so we still uh we still have the primary colours . but only on the on the outside , not on the button . yeah ? okay . yeah . yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve . and and colour . yeah . s yeah . uh actually we d we didn ' t do so well on this one . because it ' s basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . still , it ' s still hard . i mean the sponge - like and the three d_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . of course . yeah but it be because uh we couldn ' t hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the so i mean i wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . but hell yeah . if we have only one button . and even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an r_ and the reversed r_ , doesn ' t it ? so no . the only e the only thing easy about it is that you don ' t have to move your fingers . ' cause it has only one button . yeah exactly . i would say six . it ' s really not easy to use . ' cause you ' re putting everything most votes count . um definitely in casing , ' cause we have a hard plastic yeah . yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever . and the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever . so i would go for one . okay yeah . oh . no m i would g i would go for four . because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . yeah . yeah . yeah yeah . that ' s it . ah we can do the math . uh yeah . did you make this questionnaire or what ? oh . i wouldn ' t be able to do it that fast . f pretty difficult . just type in the digits . they ' re all one digit numbers right ? and then you can count them together . eleven . fifteen . sixteen . seventeen . oh what ? how hard is this ? never mind . twenty four . twenty eight . twenty eight . yeah the lower the the lower the score the better , right ? yeah but but i are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings ? i don ' t think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . so if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low the lower the better . but if you give true to a negative question no ? durable , that ' s good . easy to use . yeah . . also good . yeah okay . i guess you did do it . oh yeah yeah . no okay . okay . yeah true . yeah definitely definitely . because now it ' s just an average it ' s remote . yeah okay because of the l_c_d_ screen . but uh it looks and stuff , it still uh it ' s not , it ' s not really eye - catching , except for the colour . yeah . product evaluation . shall we try ? black . okay uh we ' re still gonna go for the fancy colours ? but are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ? one scroll button and for what ? should give it some time ? yay . have to take this away also . and this um oh yeah , of course . um pen yeah ? format . current colour red . oh yeah we did our special colour for the line widths , now that ' s a ten . it ' s gonna be one str scroll . horizontal ' s easier too , ' cause you can is it more natural than this ? so let ' s say whoops . ' kay . basically . it ' s really ugly . oh what do you mean ? like a other colour than this one ? yeah can we do it uh uh can we do a print ? i think we have to choose , yeah ? okay special colour . we do have special colour . does it mean uh that shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ? purdy . purple ? yeah yeah . oh no my remote has acne . no . that ' s why we have that button . it ' s so cute . doh . is that that ? how the we did we do that ? we can try . that doesn ' t respond also to the undo . it looks like it ' s no , where do you want some more dots ? okay , it ' s not the prettiest , i know . it ' s not so random huh ? yeah okay . we can make a l a logo . like uh put it like the shape . something like that . i mean it ' s not too uh that ' s not their logo , is it ? yeah . it ' s a how shall we do the logo in black or not ? are you dissing my drawing ? this one ? it looks like a ribbon . so who wants to draw ? this is actually quite fun . do we need to do anything ? i hear you people are typing . oh , okay . it ' s almost four . at four , yeah , ? this is really bizarre . it looks like there ' s a it looks like a butterfly . no , but it i it ' s not a bu a beamer . b it ' s a normal t_v_ screen , kind of thing . oh . yeah there is some kind of projection i think . with a with a mirror , huh ? or something . yeah . so are we gonna change anything to this ? i mean is it gonna this is gonna be flat . yeah exactly . yeah . yeah . and this is also gonna be nope . but sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work . maybe no it ' s i think you only need two points . or not . no , you sh slanted yeah . yeah . well maybe . yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing . yeah . yeah it ' s only a bit like to that side , but that is that one by the way . ' cause this one makes the angle either like this . so i if i change this , it will go there , if i change that , will go there . mm - hmm . i will take this away ' cause it looks messy . maybe we will . what ' s this anyway ? it looks like candle wax . uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? or yeah well at first i was really stressed . because it went a bit fast . but then as i knew the tempo that i had to be on , the second time i think i did a bit better . and the third time yeah , i mean yeah , yeah yeah yeah . yeah we mm - hmm . yeah . definitely . well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that yeah . you were more in charge kind of thing . i guess so . i mean i we were pretty democratic . yeah . maybe yeah . it ' s uh it ' s the the pen is more intuitive , ' cause we ' re all used to writing with pen . and uh as i said , uh i uh have no idea how powerpoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal powerpoint presentation . but once i get to know the program probably , i mean , it looks better , you know . or uh something like that . you can give it a kind of a home style , like we have i the the logo and everything . and i don ' t know . yeah the the the problem with powerpoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre - made chunks c as well . you know , you can draw something on the sketch - board and then take it there , or whatever . alright . alright . well , s see you in a second huh ? . yeah we have to pull it this way , huh ? wait . okay . uh first of all i ' ll start with the costs , because that ' s going to influence our design . if you don ' t know if you al already had a look or not ? because we have a problem . if you look closely , you can see . um i already took the liberty to make some suggestions . . . at the moment we have fifteen buttons , one l_c_d_ screen , one advanced chip - on - print . we use a uh sensor , that ' s for the speech . uh we use kinetic energy . and we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour . okay . what ' s the first thing we should drop ? the special colour of the buttons ? okay . uh should we switch to a hand dynamo ? uh that ' s the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things . batteries ? batteries . . yeah . so you ' re going to redesign something . okay , so we ' re at twenty five . um do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? mm - hmm . uh yeah . um uh another option i saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can ' t directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . that would skip nine buttons and four and a half euros . yeah ? uh then we have left uh yeah . we do . they don ' t need special colours . fine . that ' s more like it . you were saying something . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah , some more menu options . yeah . okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . but um now let ' s look . mm - hmm . uh yeah , scroll - wheel , push - button uh yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . uh yeah . yeah . it ' s uh one integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button . so you could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . you just drop the okay and the back . oh , that ' s for the speech . yeah . s s drop speech recognition ? yeah that ' s possible . buttons . that ' s not very easy to use . yep . okay . because if you d lose the l_c_d_ screen , we need a lot of yeah . we need a lot of extra buttons . okay so we drop the speech . and drop it yeah ? okay . s fo four less euros . so we still have three and a half euro to lose . yeah if you lose the the back , the okay button uh v let ' s say we only have the four arrows , and the menu button . then you ' re oh and the power button we have also . yeah . so that ' s one euro . yeah . yeah ? and that would save zero point two euros compared to no . yeah . to this together is more expensive than oof , it ' s almost the same as t keeping this . and we can drop these two . volume . and the power button . that ' s the basic . yep . okay th that ' s yeah that ' s one euro more expensive . that ' s not an option . menu , power . four arrows ? power . uh yeah . okay . so four arrows ? uh power i believe ? uh we have a back and a okay button . and the menu . yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . so the l_c_d_ ? yeah . then i rather make it wood . because then also it ' s good in the market with the forty five plus uh people . no that maybe not . but maybe it ' s better than plastic anyway . yeah ? yeah okay uh yep . yeah , yeah . yeah , okay . plastic . uh that ' s easy because plastic is free . yeah , okay . uh if we dropped uh yeah ? you still need that . s no , i keep the re yeah . yeah . because we already designed for it . so yeah and something else . no y you would rec then you have then you still need two additional buttons i believe . for the volume . you can use those yeah . oh yeah and power . that ' s three buttons and this would cost yeah . three . up , down , okay . yeah , okay . it would save enough yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half euro left . so we can maybe still use power button . yeah . yeah . you see ? oh still yeah ? oh then i miscalculated . oh yeah . shit . drop the special colour . ' kay . what else ? uncurved ? yeah . they made it very easy for us . ah , i don ' t think i can s uh persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than buttons . that ' s oh yeah since we only have one button . i just m i don ' t i think uh yeah it ' s i think it ' s grey , regular . grey and rubber . of plastic . yeah . yeah . no i don ' t think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving , no . yeah hand dynamo ? do you want an extra button ? yep ? instead of an additional power button ? yeah ? it ' s for scroll without yeah but it ' s just a scroll - wheel which you can push down . so yeah ? so woah we ' re within budget . it ' s a miracle . yeah ? okay . um , well . ' kay , this was old . yeah back to work . uh did i save it ? yeah . i i wanted to go , but i wasn ' t allowed . so uh i just forgot to save this . just a minute . . yeah , this the last phase of course , so hmm . oh . okay . um well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation . but well as you saw that hadn ' t made no sense , because we had to drop it . uh yeah . yeah it was more important , so i just pushed up the agenda . uh , evaluation criteria . you have t produced something about that ? uh you put it in the . yeah . f_ five . alt up freaky . yeah . uh , of course we dropped a little bit of those uh mm - hmm . two . uh y we should fill this in now . yeah okay . uh yeah in the new design i s would say it ' s three . but now , in original design i say two . okay then i say three . hey , you ' re marketing , eh . hmm . m maybe underline . red . oh yeah very true . he types everything . everything . you don ' t use anything else . yeah . yeah okay . yeah . mm - hmm . nope . uh check with the excel sheet . yeah integrate it . yeah . just go scrolling and it will activate . it shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but you say you double click on the no , not anymore . because he ' s now have a scroll - wheel that you can push in . like on the the mouse . yeah . to get into menu . yeah . or hold it ten seconds . no no no . uh it should be trendy . yeah . four . yeah , im in the menu . five . it ' s the weirdest remote control i ' ve ever seen . so well it ' s different . yeah . yeah , it ' s still yeah , i say two . oh , that ' s the next . two . yeah definitely . you still have rubber d or no . yeah . yeah . the one button we have . yeah you could check with the excel sheet . yeah . yeah or three . we have something . new . yeah . you like both . um oh yeah . i just couldn ' t um , just one minute . . so . no not anymore . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah well yeah . no yeah okay . so ooh . and yeah ? what ? yeah . yeah . that count them . add them ? or could somebody start calculator ? mm - hmm . yeah , yeah . you have to ' kay . so four and nice work . o one . plus five . bo uh two . four . start over ? you can oh yeah . okay . three , four , nine . uh eleven , fifteen . seventeen . s uh that was the last one . that was that . yeah . so divided by nine . so yeah . divided by nine . so thr t two . so we ' re better than average . no . things , yeah . okay . it ' s still yeah . has some shortcomings . okay so um this we had , this we had . we have to do a product evaluation . uh prototype presentation we dropped . so uh the finance we looked . we have redesigned . uh not on that , but so you can just make one big l_c_d_ screen . yeah uh the the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour . it ' s plastic . and single curved . oh and you might want to add a uh infrared led . otherwise it uh doesn ' t function uh so well . well i have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far . and i try to get chip just before uh i uh receive the excel sheet . so i yeah i ' m i ' m somewhere , but maybe you can help me . uh i was here . so ah that ' s enough to get started with , so uh , i just took one for every step and then a conclusion . yeah . well i think i have to make a p an issue called finance . yeah . mm - hmm . . . . . i don ' t think so , if you see the options . but yeah . you can ' t even draw anymore . even children can draw . can you just push pen and then keep on hmm . yeah . yeah just on the the m um the l_c_d_ display . this is your real remote . yeah . yeah . you can just reuse that , because the name is the same . initials . mm . luckily . yeah , it ' s uh yeah . okay . and copy this . just a minute . it ' s it ' s somewhere i d it isn ' t inside . yeah , and don ' t know how it ' s or eject it . from up there ? no . yeah it ' s somewhere in here . save copy . yeah . . yes . . well um now you probably have to recalibrate . oh , five minutes to the end of the meeting . and the recalibration is done using this icon here . yeah well i just okay . you go ahead . yeah . yeah . then i have to uh uh write this , and i don ' t know if you have to present , because i didn ' t receive any information about that so far . maybe we get a a final mail . yeah . yeah , i have still ten minutes to finish the report . yeah . and you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or oh no , they don ' t have beer here so you can ' t celebrate . you can just if you ma finish my presentation please . uh over there . the presentation is still open . so if you finish that then you ' ll see uh yeah next . oh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation . just uh do that quickly . uh uh well basically what that says , we discuss it and um so how were did the project process uh go ? did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? or are there uh yeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth . yeah . mm - hmm . . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . okay and was that due to my leadership ? yeah ? that okay ? okay . um was there uh enough room for creativity ? so and the uh about the board digital pen ? uh was that helpful or ooh . yeah it works . mm - hmm . use the pen . yeah yeah . blink . oh . okay , are are there any new ideas about this ? all i think i didn ' t really receive , yeah . uh uh w uh s sorry uh mm - hmm . yeah . oh . uh we should uh enter our questionnaire . ah . woah . okay . uh okay . that ' s the management . hope so . um . oh , . no . oh . no . yeah but young people like that . so just do normal battery . yeah . it has to be twelve and a half . or not ? uh , yeah . but we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it ' s it ' s flat , and the screen screen is just well you just have to hold it like this then . so alright . let ' s do it then . yeah . we f_ eight . yeah . the joystick . integrated scroll - wheel push - button , yeah . yeah or or the integrated scroll - wheel push - button . so that ' s kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you ' re out of it . but you still but you then still need to have well you can use the scroll - wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . but you still um you still have to have some some button in the menu to go back . yeah . well not all . not s not sound i guess . mm . yeah . wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ? speech recognition . right . buttons . no , it can be disturbed by by noise and stuff like that . let let let me see what ' s more what ' s more popular . i guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . i have to look on that . let me see . uh well no i was wrong . there are more people who like speech recognition than an l_c_d_ screen . but if it but it it it ' s a it ' s a both a hypers no , but well we yeah we keep the screen . i mean it ' s it ' s about the same . eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six . yeah . let ' s drop the speech . sixteen euros . but y y yeah . yeah . and then and then use um the the okay . and the menu button does also does the okay function then . and then when you in the menu s so so you activate the menu . yeah yeah . yeah . . well okay . for example if you have f f four buttons , channel up and down , uh volume left right okay , i ' ve i think we have to keep that . and then and the power button . so that ' s five . that ' s basic . that that ' s what you need anyway . and then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu . or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll - wheel with a push - button . and then if the moment you use the scroll - wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . click again , it ' s okay . then you only need one button to move back . or or under each option , you set a you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . and in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . so that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll - wheel push - button . but we can ' t drop three buttons . but i see that ' s yeah . so that ' s not a good idea . because which buttons do we have now ? those five which i mentioned , and then menu , and then yeah . f of the four things ? yeah , th power . which more ? yeah . power . th yeah that ' s five . yeah , okay that ' s seven , and one to activate the menu , yeah . so okay that ' s eight . well we can ' t reduce that . we we keep the display . oh , well okay . yeah . yeah well we need the advanced instead of r yeah but but that ' s not our market . ah no , hard plastic . yeah , plastic with special colour . no but i i because we have to use the special colour anyway . you forgot that . so let ' s go for the plastic . and since it ' s not kinetic , it doesn ' t have to flip around that much ? we still have problem of two euros . yeah we can ' t drop them . do we really need that advanced chip for an l_c_d_ display ? oh . i rather keep i rather keep the display . so the only option is an hand dynamo . oh no tha oh that ' s one euro , right . and then integrated s yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . i mean it ' s not that important , easy to use , but yeah . you you press it for like three seconds . then then then you should do everything in the menu . on the screen . yeah . yeah , but we ' d alright . it s it saves us four euros and it costs us two and a half . so let ' s see , we we drop the price by one and a half . but we still have thirteen left . thirteen . so still half . there goes the special co well that would make it less appealing . so that ' s no option . we sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ? well yeah . yeah . we made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it ' s a cool feature . yeah but i mean what is meant by special colour ? s yeah . alright . yeah . so i rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour . you can still play with it then i guess . i don ' t know . yeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . so i guess that isn ' t an option . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah true . let ' s let ' s go for the hand dynamo then . or or do we or do we do uncurved and flat ? instead of yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . and a screen . yeah . s what what is special f oh yeah , special form . maybe that ' s nicer . but we don ' t have any buttons . so do d uh make it a special colour then . yeah ma make it a special colour then . okay . make it a special colour and then it look fancy . so yeah . let ' s let ' s save it . yeah . let ' s do it like this , i mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we yeah all your designs are uh pretty much yeah but that but that ' s the fun part of it . alright . yeah what ' s the next uh phase ? uh the agenda . by your humble p_m_ . oh f frustrated . alright . yeah . drop , yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah that that ' s yeah . i uh i sure did . and it combines with product evaluation . uh so we all have to keep in mind what has changed now . so what we have left on the because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . alright . let ' s make it big . um well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . true or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a scale , as we all know it . um well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . um well they are in a word document , which i will open now . yeah . i don ' t know it ' s open yet . no . and we all have to uh agree on a certain level . what ' s this ? oh . i don ' t know . um well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . so that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions . how do you think about that ? yeah the us u it it it ' s it ' s mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . so do you think yeah . you can you can ma yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . that ' s true . i mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen . so on a scale from one to seven , what do you think ? huh ? two or three ? something like that ? well we have to choose one . so uh what do you say ? i agree on two . yeah . i uh i say two , personally . but yeah well we have to evaluate i guess what we have now . yeah ? you say three , and you you said al also three ? three ? okay well i say still two , but it has to be three then . yeah i know . so it ' s made bold . but it ' s nah , it ' s not very clear on the sc maybe other colour , yeah . that ' s better . uh yeah . alright . oh , it doesn ' t have to be bold anymore . alright . yeah . um well the remote control has wha the remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . for example audio settings and screen settings . yeah . well , yeah . so it it ' s a very true point . i mean it hides all those function . but , i mean uh they ' re hidden in the screen . if you don ' t want to use them , you don ' t s you s just scroll over them . and you place them f i don ' t know where . so that ' s very true , i guess , for our case . uh the second point . it shows the relevant and most used functions . power button . do we ha still have a power button ? well yeah the button ' s integrated , huh ? yeah we dropped it . you j you just push it in for yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then yeah . i don ' t know . yeah . um it shows the relevant and most used functions . yeah uh on the other uh on one side i would say yes , and the other side i would say no . so it ' s i don ' t know . yeah . with the scroll butt yeah and then say channel . and then hmm ? yeah . yeah . but but how do you change from volume to channel ? no . no we have n we have no buttons left . so the joystick was not an option . so so you hav so you you have to double - click , i mean , for , i mean , uh volume , and three double click for the menu , or something . yeah . yeah . yeah . alright . but but ease of use was not very important , may i remind you . so that ' s yeah but that that ' s not a question . uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . well i think it ' s pretty much in the middle . you have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . so so maybe it ' s more like a f a five . or yeah . five or six ? five ? alright . yeah . oh . yeah . yeah . alright . uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like l_c_d_ screen and speech recognition . well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . but it has at least one innovation . i say two then . yeah but that that ' s not that ' s not this question . uh thi uh that ' s the other question . this one . two yeah . i think l_c_d_ ' s more useful than speech what ? oh not the bold one . right . okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge - like material . it should have been two questions . i realise now , because sponge - like material is dropped . but the look and feel yeah . the button has also colour . yeah . yeah . the one . mm mm . yeah we have single curve now , and no and no material . so maybe in the middle or something . yeah , i mean it ' s worth the yeah . yeah . yeah . but then we would have to drop the screen . oh red . yeah . yeah . i like bold . uh the remote control displays the corporate logo . yeah . you just have to draw it . yeah . but there ' s uh enough space for the corporate logo . i mean , if there ' s only one thing . yeah . so i will say that is very true . yeah . the remote control is easy to use . well i would say skill , uh i would say six , or something . i don ' t think it ' s easy to use , or not so . yeah . yeah . it it it has a nice screen . but yeah . yeah . well i i would say a five or a six . what do you say ? easy to use ? five or a six ? so a six , more . yeah , uh i would go for the six too . so um well , another question , uh the remote control is durable . i don ' t know if that ' s the correct word . but uh in use , both battery as casing ? yeah ? true , true . and the casing is plastic , ? yeah . if you don ' t drop it too much , it ' s uh should last pretty long . yeah ? but uh i think rubber compared is better . so i think a two is more appropriate than yeah . logo . okay i will go go for two . uh the last one ? the remote control ' s a good example for company ' s motto , we put the fashion in electronics . uh turn around . yeah . but um yeah ? it ' s not yeah , true . so a four . it ' s it g it g goes , it ' s not the best we could do , i guess . but it all has to do with the budget , because it ' s it ' s not the bad idea we had , so alright , yeah . right . so if i understood it right , we have to count these numbers . uh yeah . mm - hmm . oh oh alright . word document , the yeah we have to count them . uh yeah just add them and then uh divide them . yeah . mm . i all made it po i i all made it i all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it . i mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , uh yes . yeah . thanks . oh easy . question number four , yeah ? yeah . how hard is it ? yeah just use oh there tho uh there ' s no n there ' s no num pads . it ' s a it ' s a bit uh yeah . i think you can just count them by a um let ' s move over . three , plus one , four . nine . uh , yeah . are you here ? eleven . fifteen . sixteen , yeah . no sixteen . uh sixteen plus six . twenty two . twenty two , yeah ? tw twenty twenty eight . twen uh okay . by nine . that ' s uh three uh or le less than a three . yeah . twenty eight di divided by nine makes three point one one one one one one one . yeah . yeah , but there are no negative questions i guess . good example . durable use . easy to use . this is good . fancy look and feel , that ' s good . technology innovation was good , because of a marketing uh requirement . re relevant most used function . and hides these functions . that was also a good thing . and then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing . so it were all positive questions , by uh by purpose . so yes , so the it tells us something , yes . becau but the picture would be a lot different if we didn ' t have to drop those uh those things , i guess . yeah . nah it it ' s it ' s better than average , but yeah . so th yeah . no . the colour and the screen . yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this with some casing around it , yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . oh yeah . yeah . do we have to do other things ? or just redesign ? alright . yeah . so you made a start , right ? yeah . alright . the the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . the playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour okay . that ' s conceptual , yes . mm . how many pages ? alright . y you have you have done the first two . okay , and and the look and feel is yeah . the items we had to drop . where did we start with price ? twenty six and a half . or not ? or twenty six ? something like that . this ? speckles ? uh yeah . yeah . some some big dots . yeah . . . . . we have the original balance sheet , or yeah . woah . just cut . control z_ . yeah . yeah . just dual screen . very nice . yeah . y y you you you push the button or something . or lot of options . yeah , the r_ and another r_ . it ' s called the real remote , right ? maybe maybe it c it can say that . the real remote . yeah . welcome . yeah . yeah . you can copy and paste the picture if you want . yeah . what is that ? look more looks more like a campfire . yeah . yeah . type in your report . i don ' t see any new messages . so hmm ? luckily , yeah . what time do we have to deliver the report ? four o ' clock or or before that ? just compare uh no it ' s on the on the beamer i guess . yeah . strange . this something what ' s projection from behind , i guess . yeah it it ' s a beamer , but then with a within a mirror , yeah . so it looks like a big screen , but in fact it isn ' t . well it ' s it ' s single single curved . th this is flat . yeah . but it ' s it ' s better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice . i mean you see more of this than of that . yeah , more like that . it ' s not very uh ideal . do like this . yeah . what ' s this ? ooh . but i don ' t see a detector over there . i thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something . yeah . or just messed it up . yeah . yeah but it wasn ' t good . yeah it it has to touch the corners , i guess . but th this one wasn ' t good , because if i was drawing here , i drew a line and then it came over here . oh . ooh . yeah yeah , it ' s it ' s okay . it ' s working again . it ' s better than before . yeah . yeah that ' s improved uh pretty much . yeah . yeah but it ' s better , it ' s better mm . no . it ' s better than it was i guess . silly . yeah . works pretty well . five minutes before the meeting ' s over . and then ? we have to present alright . so it after the after after these five minutes , you have to alright . after after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or alright . and we uh right . chill . huh . uh yeah ? next slide . yeah ? how do you do it ? alright . yeah . yeah . and we move more to to working together as team , because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . and then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay i will arrange this and you will arrange that , and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . so the process , i mean , the interaction between us became better and better i guess . yeah , especially if f f if you see uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting i guess . yeah . yeah . li limiteded afterwards , but if if you don ' t take that into account , there ' s plenty of room for creativ creativity . also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh the the board and uh powerpoint and word and stuff like that . mm uh i think in in essence the digital pen is better than the smartboard . because it it it just works better . i mean uh uh i ' ve made yeah , uh i ' ve made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . so it it ' s better a better device than uh than the screen . but the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn ' t work that well . yeah . yep . warning . finish meeting now . well , it it ' s use especially useful , i guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff . and and the screen and stuff like that . yeah . yeah . yeah . but it it ' s useful to to show something to to an a small audience , and then to yeah . these these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things . so yes . check your email . you also . right . yes boss . well see you soon . yeah .","the project manager decided to start by looking at costs instead of the prototype presentation because the original design was too expensive and had to be changed . the group discussed which features should be dropped . the group decided that the lcd screen was integral to their design , but dropped the speech recognition . they decided to drop all the buttons in favour of an integrated scroll push - button , and to use a hand dynamo instead of kinetic energy as a power source . the marketing expert led the prototype evaluation , based on the new design . the group were satisfied with the overall score of 3 . 1 . the industrial designer and user interface designer worked on a drawing of the new design , while the project manager and marketing manager worked on the final report . the project manager led an evaluation of the project process . the group thought that they worked well together , especially after the first meeting . they were happy with the room for creativity , but thought they were limited by the budget . they preferred the digital pens to the smartboard . they had mixed feelings about using powerpoint .",TS3006d
"okay . i ' m nick . i am the industrial designer . tool training . yeah . yes . okay . you ' ve lost uh your microphone there . okay , yeah . i ' ll i ' ll shall i see if i can get across without just tangling everything . okay . there ' s one . didn ' t think of that . ' kay uh pens are over here . i ' ll try the red pen . okay . um . i ' m gonna go for the bear which i ' m be able to draw very well , but i ' ll have a bash at it . uh . ooh ooh i lost it there . i think i ' ve just knocked the microphone . um . we ' ll g then we ' ll go for a a s small small bear . um and i like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um i dunno maybe because there ' s so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that . great . yes . um i with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they ' re quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons . as that is the main function . yes . um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible . is easy to use and see . yes . sorry , you go . you go . yeah . yes . yeah . maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote . or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or sort of the instructions that would come with it ? ' kay . or not . slide four okay . yes . ' kay , yes . i think you just said at the start it was a television remote control , so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise . ' kay . okay , that ' s great . right , so start of the first meeting . uh . right , so agenda of the first meeting . where we uh we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we uh are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? and i ' m alastair and i ' m the project leader . alright okay , so tool training . um . project plan . so does anyone have any uh thoughts as to the tool training that uh is required ? neither am i . oh i see , so we shouldn ' t really be oh right okay , so . so we have the project team , which is to um basically to come up with a new r remote control device . uh we have uh the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time . and uh our idea is to uh to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience . so um method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . so um in each of these uh phases we ' ll uh basically be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this uh this device . and uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a better better inst implement than we had before . and therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day . um and you ' ll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet this end . so we ' ve got tool training . try out whiteboard . uh . so we will um . right so everyone ' s to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . i guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works . so uh i don ' t know who wishes to go first . do you wish to go f have a first bash at uh whatever . ah uh . but now you you uh you ' ll move out from the microphone and the camera . i take it that i would i would guess so . or technical problems . i mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things . next . i don ' t see as there ' s any need to . there ' s plenty of space . i mean whatever . exactly . we ' ve had more time to prepare over this side , so we ' ve all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets . the three pens are underneath . you get marks for artistic impression . so you ' re just doing the face . right , um . well i ' ve not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time ' cause to be honest with you uh i ' m not too keen on them anyway . not to worry . so what my daughters have got at the moment is they ' ve got uh a few fish and so hopefully um won ' t prove too difficult to draw . uh as you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well . anyway um . and uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don ' t really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you ' re going away on holiday or whatever , you ' ve gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you ' re away and uh change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , so . other than the fact that they keep dying , uh fish are uh are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they ' re low maintenance . right . okay , uh if we ' re still all with us . right okay , so . work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price . that information has come from our marketing manager here . so we ' re looking to sell internationally , not just in europe . we ' re looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half euro per unit . and therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it ' s uh because obviously you ' re gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit . and so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we ' re uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time . so um experience with remote control , first ideas . new remote . so i guess we ' re looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were . so uh any any thoughts ? okay , so so basically we ' re looking for some um we ' re looking for a device that is um robust and and therefore uh won ' t get damaged too easily . um we ' re looking for a device that is uh what was the other things you said there ? easy to use . use . and see . okay . uh . mm - hmm . oh i w um basically i ' ll get back to you on that . but it seems to me sensible , ' cause as you rightly said , there ' s nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room . and uh so a device for for all remotes . hmm . but is it in a sense it ' s r um mutually exclusive . you can ' t have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to ' cause you want you want simplicity as well , you want any idiot to be able to use it . whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all . and so these are probably mutually exclusive options that uh hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they ' re more with handling them , therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on . better instructions . mm - hmm . okay . um well we ' ve got five minutes before the end of the meeting . so uh we have to uh start winding up . um is there next meeting in thirty minutes . so um right , so we ' ve got i_d_ the come on , where ' s my oh there we go . yeah . that ' s what i was looking for . right . so we ' ve got function oh what happened to the right . right . sorry about that . okay , so we ' ve got um the working design for i_d_ . for u_i_d_ the technical functions design . marketing , the user requirement specification . specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach . so . are we all clear what objectives we ' re looking to meet in the next thirty minutes ? and i guess i ' ll try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting . television remote control . that ' s true , ' cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we ' re going . but at this point in time i think you ' re right that uh shall we make it just a t_v_ . okay ? so we will depart . we will stay here and uh and break off . and i ' ll do minutes and and we ' ll see you in half and hour . okay . right s mm - hmm . yeah . i ' m robin . i ' m the marketing manager . mm - hmm , okay . i dunno . your microphone ' s just yeah . i don ' t know . we can have have a whole menagerie . right . hello . um i ' m gonna go for the dog , and i ' m gonna draw one badly as well . uh . looks like it ' s going to be a dachshund or something . right . there ' s my dog . um i like dogs because they ' re very loyal . and they ' re always happy , so whenever whenever you ' re feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they ' re always coming up and they ' re always um quite excited . so um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog . and they ' re also good for exercise as well . you can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired . and and when they ' re tired they ' re quite cute as well , so . okay , that ' s why i like dogs . great . mm - hmm . yeah . mm . yeah . i ' ve okay . yeah . um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . ' cause there ' s quite often lots and lots . and um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you ' re sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . so whereas in the past you ' d have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . so so i don ' t we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room . i don ' t know . that ' s that ' s maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . i mean we ' ve done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are , and a lot of them sort of use you know they ' re like they ' re like mini laptops . so it ' s possible that we could devise a system where where you ' re you ' re basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo , and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well , maybe . okay . if you just click return it should be okay . it ' ll get rid of the message . if you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message . oh you ' ve got . yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . okay cool . okay cheers . i ' m louisa . i ' m the user interface designer . i ' m not exactly sure what you mean by tool training . i don ' t mind . um . let ' s see . good job i got pockets today . are we supposed to do this right now , do you think , or ? oh . right here we go . okay . i think that i would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat . little smiley cat there . um and this would be because they ' re very independent , uh they ' re very intelligent , compared to dogs maybe . um and they can be very very affectionate . some people don ' t think so but i know very affectionate cats . um . um and they can look after themselves . shall i rub that out , actually ? that ' s quite good . can i just check ? is this just a television remote ? because a lot of um systems are kind of t_v_ video combined now , or t_v_ d_v_d_ combined . and one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . so if you ' ve got a combined system , it could be a combined remote . or is it just a television that we ' re supposed to be doing ? comes to your whistle . i think that might be back to the start . um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down ? i ' m not exactly clear on what we ' re designing the rem remote for . is this a mun multi - functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ? right . okay .","the group introduced themselves and their roles to each other . the project manager introduced the project aim and agenda to the group . the group acquainted themselves with the meeting - room equipment by drawing on the whiteboard . the project manager discussed the projected production cost and price point for the device . the group began a discussion about their own experiences with using remote controls and about usability features to be included in the design . the project manager instructed the industrial designer to prepare the working design , the user interface designer to research technical functions , and the marketing expert to prepare the user requirement specification . the group discussed the function of the prototype and decided that they should restrict the remote to television for the time being .",ES2014a
"mm - hmm . at least it ' s environmentally friendly . thank you . yeah . why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? mm - hmm . whic which although i think i think with wood though you ' d run into the same types of problems , wouldn ' t you , i mean it chips , it if you drop it , uh it ' s i ' m not su i think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , but you can ' t just use yeah , exactly , yeah . the stain . um , in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own y yeah . i think we can get the quality materials then it shouldn ' t influence the design principles too much , which you ' ll see with my presentation . one thing we ' d have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh yeah , for example . so , have to see how kid - friendly it is and and all that , but sure . one point three , yeah . uh , yeah . i think so , yeah . yeah , that ' s the one . so , it ' s a very short presentation , ' cause i ' m actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , um , which basically shows , sort of i took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which i completely agree with christine ' s idea to have it sort of molded , so it ' s slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . and actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi - measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control . so , that ' s actually a really good idea for customi customisability . um , one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , so that you don ' t have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they ' re not pressing the buttons while you ' re trying to watch a t_v_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . and also um you had issues with the batteries running out , so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life - light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . and in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . so , in terms of what this thing would actually look like despite working in interface design , i ' m not the greatest artist in the world , so you ' ll have to forgive me . you ' d have something like this with an on - off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don ' t accidentally turn your t_v_ off while you ' re trying to manoeuvre other buttons . and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , ' cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . and then here you ' d have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . and then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your t_v_ and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . so that if the user doesn ' t want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don ' t have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . um , so again you can have a little l_c_d_ light somewhere , the flip thing and have i forgotten anything ? i don ' t think so . so , as you can see , it ' s a very very simple design , which is one of the things i really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . yeah . but you also have to d start watching out for the weight , ' cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don ' t want it to start getting too heavy . but that ' s the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . as you can see , there ' s still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . so , that ' s pretty much all i had to say , i mean , everything else in terms of design issues . um the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , the number pad a little bit lower ' cause it ' s used less frequently . so once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less i think it should go along those lines . mm - hmm . yeah . no , no . mm - hmm . yeah . right . especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . oh yeah . yeah , so it ' s really molded to to your specific but th for that you ' d also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote . the sales , yeah . yeah . well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . yeah . yeah . and that took off , yeah , yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . i think it depends , i mean i think it ' s a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it ' s gonna be because theoretically with the t_v_ you already have a big display right in front of you . so , if we ' re trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for , ' cause if it ' s only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that ' s probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost - efficient way to go , but that ' s just sort of speculation , i mean . mm - hmm . what about the buttons , would would the buttons be wood too , or mm - hmm . okay . sure . no . okay . mm - hmm . okay . okay . so uh , if you could open the powerpoint presentation . i ' m number two . components design , there we go . so uh can we put it in slide show mode ? yeah . right here , is that little that one , yes please . thank you . i ' ll take the mouse . so uh we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components , uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . in instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , you have to have microphone well no you don ' t actually i haven ' t have to have microphone in the device , but um maybe you do have it a a way it has to it has to hear the speaker and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it ' s gets lost . um so the other w thing that we so . our method for going about this is we ' ve looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what ' s worked , what hasn ' t and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn ' t have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research . so um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . course , you know , i wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh doesn ' t seem to b be one of the choic non - option we can uh we can really seriously explore , so then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that ' s been eliminated because of the heat uh factor and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it ' s uh goes with the board . uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it ' s brittle it gets brittle after a while , so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium ' s also been eliminated uh , the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn ' t make d curved cases out of titanium , although how apple did it with th powerbook i ' m not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they ' ve eliminated all of our options except wood . so , this is our finding . and a as she said , it ' s an environmentally friendly uh material , so we ' re we ' re currently uh proposing , uh we ' ll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . so then there ' s this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , but uh these simple chips , but that ' s only works for the bu you don ' t get very much um intelligence with this simple one . and um then there was the regular which i regret that i ' ve forgotten exactly why i ' m eliminating that one . uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , which w ' member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . and uh manufacturing has told us that they ' ve um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um i i ' d really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . i think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this um three - dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then i uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . so this is the findings of our research and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . do you have any problems with that ? i ' m not sure , how do i oh , i know , let ' s see . let ' s go back up here . i think it ' s um um a multiple uh chip design um and it ' s uh maybe printed on to the circuit board . uh i could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting . i don ' t know , but i ' ll find out more at our next meeting . sounds good . because um it gets brittle , cracks um we want we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . so . good ex good expression . i don ' t know , speak for yourself , i ' m planning to be around for a while . you ' re what ? you think ? and you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . well i ' m glad you okay , good . sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . mm - hmm . mm . she works in the cubicle next to me so she ' s uh she was already a little bit prepared for this . luckily ed was not . mm - hmm . yeah , you wouldn ' t wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you ' re using your it ' s really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething . yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah . oh , i ' m sorry . right , my hand is uh different size than yours for example . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm . mm - hmm . a hinge . be like a copper hinge or you know . mm - hmm . mm . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm . mm - hmm . sure . no , f go to findings . context - sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ or something else is in . you know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball , and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand . to t an and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh yes you ' d know what kind of wood to get . that ' s right , that ' s right , you wouldn ' t wanna go too far down that . oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect , yeah . mm - hmm . right , mm . we ' d also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna um learn about um labour laws . you know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don ' t wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries . so actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you ' re uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you ' re paying a a working wage to the person who made the device . cost of living is low . good , well th that ' d be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more and to where mm - hmm . yeah . mm - hmm . hmm . hmm . hmm . mm - hmm . what do you think ed ? do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ? do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? okay . sorry about that . so the the advanced chip on print is what um what we ' ve we ' ve deci we ' ve determined and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um i think we ' ve kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case . a customisable and uh i don ' t think so , no , i think they could be rubber like they are now , so you have that tactile experience of so um are we done with this meeting ? and a marketing strategy . uh welcome back after lunch , i hope uh you had a good lunch together . for uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . okay and the agenda will be the opening and uh that ' s uh the product manager or secretary that ' s me and uh the presentations from the christine and uh agnes and from mister ed . and finally in this meeting we have to decide and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design so we have forty minutes , i think it ' s uh little bit uh low , but i i hope we can finish it up so i ' ll handle to the the functional team , to the christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept . you ' re number two . ' kay the next one . can you go back uh one slide ? yes , uh question , uh , what ' s mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? what ' s the meaning of that ? mm - hmm . yeah , is it means it ' s on the yeah is it on a micro - proc micro - processor based or uh okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good . so so you ' re not convinced about the the wood , yes . yeah , so it it ' s looks good the the design the functional design uh , what about yo you ? yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first okay then , uh , let ' s move to agnes . s you ' re you are in participant three . this one ? so what ' s your , uh , the comments or uh s okay mm - hmm . yeah . the yeah . i hope so . yeah . yeah , but we can get a production in , uh , countries like , uh , india yes , yes , countries like india or china or malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . so yeah , yeah , so yes . so yeah , so yes uh , but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay . so we don ' t need to have our own uh fabric factory or something , so we can have a tie - up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , then we can have a business tie - up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . so , but uh le let ' s decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh ed was talking . and your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so yeah . yes . i don ' t think so . yes . yes . don ' t looks nice uh . yeah , so uh what we ' ll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th ed find outs about the how much it ' s cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . okay . so maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . okay ? yeah , i hope , if is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design , okay . then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can uh submit to the i will submit to the management . okay ? then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it ' s cost as extra for uh the display . an and the marketing strategy , that ' s very important , okay . yes . how much you can how mu how much how much you can sell extra . of course you ' ll make money too , so it it ' s not only pay - out , you make money too , your commission . okay , so , any questions ? so , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then uh , then we can proceed from there . it ' s okay ? so thanks for all your uh efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then . okay ? thank you . wow , good expression . well after us . actually , i ' m ready to sell it . i ' m ready to sell it . no y no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , but there are some very pretty woods out there . that ' s actually very innovative idea . well , it ' s actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . i mean it ' s each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that ' s not on the market . in turns of wow . wood ? they do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , so , and chew ' em up . and chew ' em up . no . hmm . simple design . it ' s what consumers want . it ' s almost like , houston , we have a product here . problem is obviously gonna be cost . okay , i also have a f very simple presentation , because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want . i also have uh copied a different type of remote . if you can find me , where i ' m at . there should only be one in here . trend watch . it ' s being modified . they ' re stealing our product . we ' ve been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , ' cause uh trends change very very quickly . in six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it ' s gonna be a question how fast we can act . uh they already erased the rest of mine , huh . no no , no no . ' cause i had another comment there . uh the market trend . this is what we know from the last uh from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we ' ve done , fancy and feel - good , that ' s what we ' ve been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that ' s easy to use . looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they ' re all very similar , they all do the same thing , we have to have something completely different . okay ? easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that uh , with the whiteboard we can see that it ' s a remote that ' s easy to use . and i think this is another thing that ' s interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . so even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . the second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . the second one , there is about uh forty - five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use . the first one , i see that they put in a display . now there ' s something else uh with the little flip - up , now we ' re adding all kinds of things in , but with the little flip - up , if you have a little display on the flip - up that when you close it everything is locked . maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you ' re looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display okay because i ' ve seen mostly the standard ones , yeah . now you have it now you have one with the very simple also . the idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you ' re doing . so maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours , we might ' ve mm - hmm . how hard they squeeze ? resistance resistance , right . no , but incorporating the three uh obviously it ' d be something totally new on the market , totally different and from although , what it was it uh it was uh nokia that came out with this changeable colours . right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions , millions . so . so say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new . we have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market . where w where it would be manufactured is is another step . we ' re here to design , come up with a nice product . no . no no p spec it ' s ' cause we have to find out cost on it . um , no that ' s no problem . i ' m here for the pushing it after it ' s made . i will market it . once we get a price on it then we can market it . nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . and marketing strategy , thank you . fired .","the industrial designer gave her components concept presentation , which presented the components that will be used and how they will be integrated into the functional design . she announced that their only choice for casing material was wood , so she suggested an idea of having customizable wood cases . the user interface designer gave her presentation on the user interface concept for the product , and gave a basic layout of the remote ' s key functions . the marketing expert presented the marketing concept and discussed including a display to facilitate use . the group discussed the unique , custom design of the remote , and quickly talked about finding a manufacturer that could make the custom cases cheaply that still paid fair wages . the group also discussed whether or not to incorporate the display into the design , and decided to wait until the cost of adding that feature was known before adding it to the design . the industrial designer and the user interface designer were instructed to begin building a prototype , and the marketing expert was instructed to work on the marketing strategy as well as research the cost of the display component .",IS1008c
"help . it ' s up there ? that screen ' s black . alright , okay . okay , that ' s fine . are we done ? right , okay um , this is our second meeting and i might be a bit all over the place . um , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ? okay , um i ' ll go over what we decided last meeting , um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , t_v_ , video equipment . um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company ' s image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . um , our budget would have to affect um try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of oh oh you can see it , okay . um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . um want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . we discussed a flip - open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that . okay . um , three presentations , i ' ve got written here so shall we hear from marketing first ? no that ' s fine , that ' s fine . unplug me . um , f_n_ function f_ eight . mm - hmm . they are . okay , thank you very much . um , would you like to continue on from that ? or , maybe move the laptop over . f_ function . oh , there . ' kay . um , i think we ' ll chat about it at the end , okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um ooh , it ' s vibrating , that ' s strange . oh , god . right , okay . we just do the best we can . yeah , you might . ah . look at that . okay . yeah . right , um we have new project requirements , um we ' re not going to be using teletext , um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . um our control is only going to be for t_v_ , it ' s not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer . it says for t_v_ only , so looks like it ' s just yeah , i think maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but i don ' t know , what do you think ? it just said , for t_v_ only . but i mean , general t_v_ controls do do video as well . i mean you bu well som you get com you get combined t_v_ and videos don ' t you ? mm . i think we assume that it ' s still got play and stop functions and programming . mm . hmm . mm - hmm . yeah , bu we do have a budget limitation that we can ' t control ourselves , so i think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing um because it is something i it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don ' t lose , you were saying whistling , maybe on the t_v_ you could put like a pack on the t_v_ or something so you can ' t see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the t_v_ and it beeps and you ' re like oh okay it ' s over there , something like that , but that ' s that sounds a lot cheaper to me . um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , i mean what you were talking about with the marketing . um , people paying more for it to look good . um , we need to focus on that as well . yeah . mm . yeah . mm - hmm . what about you were talking about the buttons , um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , i mean , ' cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers yeah ? um so you it ' s like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn ' t wear out as much either , not sure about the you don ' t have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . um , think that might appeal i ' m thinking kind of japan , i ' m thinking uh young , um office people , trendy kind of a thing . um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that ' s obvious what that ' s for and it ' s not daunting to maybe the older generations , um were too big . mm . i think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um . it ' s gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um . or a speech recognition , which is extremely expensive , i think that ' s the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue . we are we ' re talking about um the type of company that we ' re working for as well . that they want um it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you wouldn ' t automatically assume associate that with the older generations . now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but i don ' t think we ' re focusing on that , i think we are focusing on a sort of mid - range um , business kind of class type people . mm - hmm . okay , so the remote control functions . um we ' ve got the t_v_ , we ' ve got the video , now there ' s um i can ' t remember what it ' s called , the little code at the end of programme details , yes . we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that i always found that really easy when i discovered it , um because you ' ve got your general record anyway so if you there ' s a programme on you want to put record on , that ' s fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you ' re not sure if you ' re going to , you put the number in and it ' s just a number , it ' s not a date , it ' s not a time , it ' s not a channel , it ' s not when it finishes , it ' s not anything like that , it ' s just a number . no . you ' ve already got the numbers for typing in anyway . it is after um if you look in the newspaper , t_v_ guide or any t_v_ guide there ' s a five , six digit number afterwards and that ' s the number you put in and it ' s recorded that it ' s going to be on on tuesdays at ten o ' clock on the seventeenth so you don ' t have to worry about dates and you don ' t have to worry about times , um and it has been around for quite a long time . no it ' s not um but i think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that mm . okay so mm - hmm . the functionality of it in the sense that you ' re sitting there , you ' re pressing this button and your t_v_ ' s not doing it . taking your t_v_ and your control and saying look this is what i ' m doing , it ' s not working , what should i do ? i think so . um instruction manuals . but i mean they ' re there ' s customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there ' s no call out charge , there ' s no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um . mm . but we should focus on making the manual as user - friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages . it does , you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . um , what other functions ? we need i ' m not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about c ' cause you ' ve got the dilemma between oh batteries , that ' s what i was thinking about . mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? well they la they they last quite a long time , and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you ' re not using it or t at night or something , but it doesn ' t really matter ' cause it never really runs out ' cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . um , something like that should reduce the size of it . yeah it could be on that yeah , okay . s yes . rechargeable with a docking station . so the rechargeable which would be your field . okay . yes , which it is cheaper in the long run as well . um , th the shape you got trendy . i don ' t wanna big box with lots of things , you don ' t want a tiny sort of little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple , um they do . okay so we ' ve got a flip - screen . um okay . ' cause it ' s kind of moulded to your hand anyway . okay . can you look into the company logo ? um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . i mean for example , if it was a c_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague c_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that ' s there . well we need to think about how it ' s gonna look different . or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . you could have different kind of casings . so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and yeah . mm . okay . okay . okay . right , i think we have to round it up , um sure . that was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date it ' s kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that . um it could be it c it yes , it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature , you know , drawing attention to that . and it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , ' cause it ' s very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful . yeah . um we ' ve got the buttons but i think we ' ll work through that with the design of it , um . yes . yes . and we ' ve talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um . learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . but there aren ' t gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i the instruction manual , i don ' t know if we deal with that , um . i think yep , and different from what ' s out there . yep , i think that ' s us . i think you might get guidance , but um i th instruction manuals , ' cause there tends to be a demonised thing , u um , they ' re everyone ' s got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them . um . yes , right . okay . right , okay . i think you can email me , if there ' s any more questions . um and i ' ll be able to not answer them . okay , yeah i ' ll go first . can i grab the thanks . what do i have to press ? oh , f_ eight ? oh right , yeah . okay . maybe yep there we go . okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh industrial designer extraordinaire . ' kay , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so . what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ? well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the t_v_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the t_v_ or other appliance that it ' s sending the signal to . um , so i decided i ' d have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . but uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and i thought that was something that well it wasn ' t really my area because i ' m dealing with the inside really . so um , yeah i ran out of time so i couldn ' t do this one as fun as the last one . um and uh i found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don ' t need to send very much information . um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . now our one , i ' m i ' m not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i didn ' t know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control . yeah sure . um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they ' re quite they ' re quite chunky and that ' s because of the size of the batteries , they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . yeah the the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but i ' m just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across . um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about ' em being small and easy to carry round . um , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries ' cause otherwise it ' s not gonna work , uh as i said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you ' re putting in from from the controller and to turn it into an i uh infrared signal which we ' re going to use to send the information . now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who ' s watching the t_v_ unless they ' re in a cinema , which not most people do so as we ' re applying to the most audience that should be fine . and then i was uh just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the uh interface designer . and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . it ' s not a proper circuit , i ' m not sure if it ' d work or not , i ' m not even confident that those are the real um the real way you ' d wire it up but anyway , we ' ve just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh u_i_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r_ data which could be decoded by the t_v_ receiver , which obviously means that we ' re gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the t_v_s are already using and since that that ' s another use and reason to use that infrared because that ' s what all t_v_s use at the moment . and then finally , um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i ' ve put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , uh because they ' re small they ' re also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti - going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , i th that was just sort of a general point there . and that ' s uh yeah . alright okay , and yeah , that ' s that ' s what i came up with there , so if you wanna ooh . function f_ eight yeah . no , no yeah it ' s just . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah sure . there we go , i ' ve got a bit more of the cable . there we go . uh you should be able to and yeah , there you go . okay . huh . t yeah yeah . i d well i dunno ' cause uh the w if you ' ve g yeah . if yeah and if you got if you got a sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the t_v_ anyway so on to on to like the t_v_ hard drive or so . yeah . yeah . ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it ' d probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they ' re not that great anyway . alright , okay . alright , okay . yeah . yeah but um on on that again i just thought ' cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it ' ll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so i thought that could be quite a yeah . yeah . yeah . hmm . yeah . yeah . well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs i mean inside they ' d be essentially exactly the same . just yeah , yeah . ' kay . yeah , yeah that ' s what i was just yeah . no , well no ' cause you wouldn ' t have to you don ' t actually have to press them you just yeah . yeah . mm . but also er ergonomics as we ' re saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there ' s sort of physically different things ' cause um if you ' ve ever seen the x_ box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan wouldn ' t buy it because the controller was physically to big because um they ' re c uh just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn ' t get round the controller which is uh so if you i don ' t know what ' cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . yeah . yeah . yeah . hmm . huh . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . i yeah i was just thinking about how you could combat that ' cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes yeah . yeah , speech recognition , but yeah . mm . ge uh yeah . video plus . yeah yeah . just whack in the number . and you w yeah . and you wouldn ' t you wouldn ' t need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that , you just need one ' cause you ' ve already got all the numbers there anyway , yeah . it ' s not yeah . it ' s been been around for a long time it ' s just it ' s not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . mm . though if y if you ' ve got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it ' ll record that programme when it ' s on and you press it on it twice and it ' ll record the whole series . so that yeah . but just to have that function would be would be really good . yeah . mm . but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they ' ve they ' ve got an obligation to to help you out and also i mean it ' s it ' s fair enough to have some sort of help service but i i ' m not sure how much the cost would be of having yeah , i mean i mean instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that . yeah . department , yeah . yeah . and they ' re yeah , they should be f yeah . yeah . yeah . it ' s the uh yeah . um they ' re they ' re specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , i mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh yeah on that as well so . yeah some sort of docking station or yeah . yeah yeah th yeah that that ' d be fine , and also that would mean they wouldn ' t have to go out buying batteries all the time . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . mm . yeah . mm . yeah . yeah . yeah . okay . mm - hmm . sorry . yep . okay . yep . ' kay . it can be okay , that ' s okay with me . further . oops . why ' s it not working ? f_ eight , right ? okay . mm why ' s it in the right ? yeah , it ' s connecting . okay . yeah . actually mm some of my points might overlap with what william ' s just mention , but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think we ' ll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , i haven ' t had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with t_v_ to make make it as simple as possible . and to summarise i i would say it ' s it should be user - friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . so what the concept is to have a flip - top model . the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip - top . so it ' s like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . findings most people prefer us user - friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it ' s not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . as we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? yeah , with that i think we ' ll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . um , that ' s so this is if you ask me personally , i would make uh flip - top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that . so in overall a simple and uh user - friendly design . uh any comments like , if you want ? okay . i think you ' ll have to you can ' t it ' ll have to this can ' t be pulled . you ' ll have to push it a bit more . yep . yeah this is more than enough . okay . yeah i think you can pull it out now . yeah . ' kay . that ' s fine . okay . mm - hmm . anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ? ten perc mm - hmm . okay . pens mm - hmm . okay . so are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ? sure . alright . right . the features could be same and the body could look slightly different . so yeah . yeah , uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . so , a bigger b okay so y you ' re dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you ' re desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market . maybe for u_s_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in japan and all you need to have a small , yeah . mm - hmm . we could focus on the biggest market . if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . right . i think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . simple . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? mm - hmm . right . mm - hmm . okay . what i was thinking of a design which nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate . that ' s very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you don ' t have to you don ' t bend your thumb too much , so it ' s like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat . g uh so what happens is you don ' t have to press your thumb too down like . so it ' s already curled up so your thumb doesn ' t y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your the way you h hold of it ' s kind of semi - circular in the bottom , something like that . i wouldn ' t say exactly semi - circular but yeah smooth . current . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . we could look in at that but mm . what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea - shells , logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . a sea shell ? yeah we could look in at that . yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . but we can like think of five , six designs . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . for detection , right . yep , i think true . oops . we should f i think it ' s time for us to get back to oh god . uh , no that ' s okay , sorry . um is it okay if i postpone that til later , i just want to get access to a little bit more information , is that okay ? mm - hmm . could i can i interject to ask a question there , is that appropriate ? you ' re saying the triple a_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ? mm - hmm . right , the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? oh i see . okay . mm . mm . mm . that ' s a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so i can refer to that , whenever you like me to present . no . the plug hasn ' t come out at the bottom , has it ? no . meter adjusting . mm . ' kay . have i got to keep this here ? does it matter ? i ' ll have t i ' ll have to move it won ' t i ? uh , whoops . will it manage ? bit more , oh dear . oh . is that okay ? thank you , just pull it closer a little bit . get it right over , okay , thank you . okay , um , i ' m going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . um , so that ' s where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company ' s usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross - section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . our findings , lots of findings , i ' ve just summarised some of them here . the overall thing which i ' ve i ' ve got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that ' s quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that ' s a bit nicer looking . um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . for example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you ' ve got your person sunk back in the sofa channel - hopping . so again there ' s power implications there . um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don ' t have so many functions actually on the remote control . um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it ' s a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and i think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can ' t be bothered to learn about the other functions . um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid i think in uh when they ' ve lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . something we didn ' t put to them , but which i ' m thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they ' re not so bothered with this . i had marvellous tables and things that i could show you , but i think i ' ll just keep it simple , if there ' s any more information i can email you extra details , is that okay ? mm - hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ? just channel - hopping . would that imply video use ? mm - hmm , yes . yes . um we didn ' t really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons , i think th th those do tend to be the basic channel - hopping things and on and off for the video , fast - forwarding , so on and i think it ' s sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare . so i don ' t know if that ' s something we need to look at . mm - hmm . in fact i ' ve just called up that table there , we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn ' t differentiate . would you prefer an l_c_d_ screen , that ' s multi - function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? so you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of don ' t knows in the older age group , i think that ' s just general fear of new technology . oh yeah . right . mm . yes . that ' s a super idea . yeah . yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it ' s gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who ' s sixty and also across the world if we ' re aiming at the international market . what is um attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african , i dunno , you get the idea . it ' s it ' s gonna vary around the world . at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it ' s the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . yeah . mm . mm . mm - hmm . yes it will appeal to sections of the market def mm - hmm . mm - hmm , mm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . i ' m concerned , when you read the the r_s_i_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , i don ' t think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , i think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . um , r_s_i_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . i ' m j i really can ' t get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it ' s something we should think about . mm . i know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes i know . yeah . yes . mm - hmm . do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . do we really have to go for everyone right away ? um . mm . and when we ' ve been throwing up our ideas we ' re automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people . mm . mm - hmm . mm . mm . i ' m just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it ' s most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this . mm . right , i ' ve not come across that function but it sounds wonderful . ah , hmm . right . superb . mm . yes . right . excellent , mm - hmm . mm . right . can i just run this past you while it occurs to me , i don ' t mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that ' s kind of what led us on to comparing t_v_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you ' ve got any problems with it and they ' ll fix it , they ' ll phone the company , you can use their telephones . is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it i press for this ? th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? mm . mm - hmm . right . alright . yes if it was something as simple as you couldn ' t change the channel , but i mean for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it ' s only gonna be for t_v_ and video , we ' re not gonna put any okay , just a thought . okay . mm - hmm . sure . mm . yeah . not for such simple functions because we ' re focusing on that , yes okay . mm . puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes . sure , okay . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm . and we don ' t w i mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . we definitely an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don ' t want that . mm - hmm . slightly curved , curved . mm . mm . i mean look at the mobile . i think that ' s that sounds a really attractive idea , i ' ve not come across anything like that before , if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip - top . then it ' s nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you ' re having to actually insert in between the two covers , that ' s gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think . i think it ' s a really nice idea and plus you can get you know even though we ' re using plastic , you can still i mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior . mm - hmm . yeah . mm - hmm . less chance of it being lost too , it ' s not like a chocolate brown lozenge that ' s gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don ' t not gonna lose it so much either . it ' s easier to bit nice to handle . mm - hmm . okay . can i just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that i haven ' t missed anything . so it ' s no teletext , it ' s only for t_v_ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about videoplus . right . right . right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the l_c_d_ , a reminder about using videoplus ? so that they have a look at the guide and or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add - on feature ? uh - huh . right . right , so it ' s kind of doing away with the programming feature ? right . mm , and the rechargeable batteries . was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements ? mm - hmm . that ' s not at the moment a requirement , it ' s something we ' re looking at , what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . okay . what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? or shall i just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ? okay . okay . whoops , questionnaire four . ' cause we ' re at lunchtime now i think .","the industrial designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote . he presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design . the user interface designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy - to - use ; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface . the marketing expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device , and discussed users ' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology . the project manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function , that it be used only to control television , and that it include the company image in its design . the group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market . they discussed the functions the remote will have , including video plus capability and rechargeable batteries . a customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user - friendly , but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget . the group then discussed the shell - like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers .",ES2004b
"mm . oh . oh . oh , that ' s a shame . yeah . yeah . mm . yeah . yeah . no . i don ' t think yeah . yes you should you should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it ' s supposed to work . yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , i think . yeah right . it sh it should be there , the manual . but but not to explain how the remote works . only hmm . no . i think that ' s uh difficult to realise also . no and we have customers in multiple uh countries i think . yeah . no . oh you go . yeah , go ahead . high tech . you can also like yeah , i was thinking you can are some of the the the um maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . like some uh little uh gameboy things or some hmm ? well yeah alright , but yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they ' ll understand it , i think . eighty per cent would . yeah that ' s true . yeah but mm . well i thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing , but obviously that ' s not the case . yeah . for instance you couldn ' t see this . um yeah . well i ' m mike , user interface designer . the the method ? well i used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . um yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . um this one is engineering - centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . this one is user - centred . um i like user - centr centred uh uh also the best . um well , i thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the d_v_d_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . uh so i thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . but yes . th that ' s why this mm is not relevant any more i feel . um i think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we ' ll need . i um i kinda like the shape . i think this is what we talked about . but no i ' ve well i showed it somewhere . um oh yeah . i think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . so we can can uh yeah customise the mm ? yeah . it ' s a front . it ' s not the the whole remote that changes , of course . you can mm . or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . so l like ericsson does every uh s something like this . it ' s recognisable . um yeah ? yeah yeah . something like that , in the yeah . yeah . um well so uh uh like i said i thought we ' d we ' d use more function . if we we had to include more functions . but we don ' t . so um yeah . i think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . maybe some less . like eject we don ' t need , and some other buttons we don ' t need . i think uh yeah , i will . i think uh for the remote um uh less is more . the less buttons the better the design . um we should go with that concept i think . i know . mm . yeah , but what kind of features ? like l_c_d_ screens and voice recognition . but i ' ve yeah , that ' s nice . yeah , we should keep that simple too . it will no , it should be uh integrated . i think yeah , something like on um some radios in car . you where it ' s , yeah , walking to yeah . wa yeah . yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . or maybe you will get that information uh yeah . at the top or at the bottom ? yeah but yeah but with with the l_c_d_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . ' cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . yeah , no mm . uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . i c well i d i think that ' s that ' s ugly but i th yeah . power button always yeah . yeah . yeah , y you gotta zap like this or you want to yeah . yeah you don ' t want you want uh yeah it it it must be a remote . yeah . at the bottom ? in a few minutes oh yeah , oh yeah , i totally agree . yeah . he ' s the boss . no it ' s our job . for all of us i think . the ten numbers ? yeah ? volume ? i think we we should use something like this um to um the the channel up and channel down button ? yeah , in circle , you know ? and and a volume control also in it . yes , as i already said , we could drop some of these buttons . yeah . i think these should be in one big circle in the middle . yeah but people don ' t like it when their buttons are all over the place . they they need to be centred . volume hardly . no i don ' t think . yeah but yeah but no . the other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . so well they are used four times an hour , so power bu button should be left at the top . mm . yeah . well consensus , um we we can put it in the middle , so alright . no . well just when you push a one one and no , if you on most t_v_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , d it yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . we we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here . or at yeah alright then . oh , they can be small or round like buttons . why go to video ? that ' s just zero . yeah . yeah , but you can can zap down yes , i think th no , then you press ninety nine . i think go to video is an irrelevant button , but yeah well y you must have . yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something , and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh yeah , alright . i think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah . yeah , the or the volume or something like that . your pen . i thought we ' d uh lunch uh right now , or not ? yeah , lunch break . great man . who starts ? alright , great . alright . mm - hmm . yes . ' kay . yeah . no . you ' re the only one . alright . ' kay . alright . right . yeah . okay . okay . alright . yeah . but let ' s forget about it . it ' s just time - consuming , so we uh have to go on . yes . mm . right . yeah . yeah . i think i have to start . oh no , no problem . i i just have to uh to think which file ' s mine , ' cause i was uh bit in a hurry . i think it ' s this one . but i ' m not sure . hmm ? yeah . s right . yes . this is it . well , i ' m going to tell you something about functional requirements . um to start with these points . uh next sheet ? um at first i tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it ' s uh a smart thing to exclude those things . uh , furthermore it ' s very important what they do like and what they do use . um then i tell something about um the most important issues . so we have to focus on those three thing three things . and in the end i ' ll um show you our target audience or our target product users , customers . well , um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . that ' s seventy five per cent of the current users . they don ' t like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . um they also say , that ' s about uh i thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . so it ' s very important that you design a a nice looking control . um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . so it ' s really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . furthermore , it ' s uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . yeah , yeah right . right . a lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room . so it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that ' s your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . i dunno , maybe that ' s an idea . ' cause it ' s uh a big i think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . so yeah but what if you lose your click - on device ? yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? nee but it it specifically says it ' s uh the the control is lost in the same room . so well a beeping device would be uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it ' s it ' s too uh too difficult to learn . so the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . yeah but people don ' t read manuals . no . i think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual . yeah . right . and it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . alright . and we don ' t have much time . so it ' s better to uh put our attention to the the design . so you can pick up and use it , than i think . yeah right , right . next point . um r_s_i_ . well that ' s about twenty per cent i thought . but uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh wie zeg ik dat ? yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . it should be a good in your hand . right , this is the most important part . um , we ' re like the requirements said , we ' re gonna specify of we ' re gonna target a younger audience . um , that ' s about sixty per cent of the market , so it ' s uh quite important . um research shows that they like to have a little l_c_d_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . uh i thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . so it ' s very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs . yeah but they think it ' s really important . so if we want to s if we have a big if we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , i dunno . we have to uh yeah , i don ' t know . i don ' t have any information on that . so right . and uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . they also like that , but research is very uh costly . so yeah , but it it might be important for the sale . well i do think l_c_d_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . so we might consider l_c_d_ screens . alright . alright . um , i think that ' s it . um i think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . so you can right . yeah . right . alright . next button . oh right . purple . yeah , yeah , yeah . a bit . maybe you can select it . so it uh inverts . the p the whole picture . nah , uh never mind . yeah . alright . right . can i say something ? um i have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . well teletext is not an option , so that uh but i think it ' s very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can ' t have r_s_i_ uh consequences . right . make them big , make them easy to uh to press . right . yeah , right . right . yeah , that ' s right . that ' s right . that ' s right . we but yeah . that ' s very important . and but is that is that useable ? do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ? it ' s a f it ' s a new feature , you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . yeah , he feels it immediately . yeah , that ' s right . yeah . right , continue . sorry . yeah , that ' s right . alright . alright . yeah , it ' s clear . i dunno . i think uh w about twenty minutes ago ? losing time losing time . yeah right . so i don ' t think so . yeah right . these are already in use ? alright , okay . well yeah , me too . mm . but we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? alright . yeah , right . yeah . but it yeah , that ' s right . yeah , that ' s a must . we must have that . we can make a symbol of the company right here . and if you put a front on it , there ' s a hole on the front . so the symbol ' s always on yeah . yeah , yeah . but let ' s not focus on the front . alright . yeah , i agree . i ' ve i ' ve got another point . um there are two target audi audiences , and we ' ve uh chose for the younger one . um , research has shown that um it ' s a high interested uh in features . they are high high interested in feature . but they are more critical . fo yeah , critical . so the younger audience . so we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . mm - hmm . clip aren ' t used much . yeah right . yeah but yeah . here , look at these numbers . the newest features are , like i said , are uh l_c_d_ and uh speech uh control . our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . you see ? so we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . the concurrent ? competitors , right . so , i do think we have to uh have some features . even though they cost a little more . right . right . like a ticker - tape . which programme you are l watching or something . yeah , right . yeah right . no not clickable . nah , no no no . yeah , just at at the top . so when you s you sit like this you can can watch . i think it should be at the top . yeah right . it ' s a ticker - tape idea . well it ' s just one script . yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . so i don ' t think that ' s the issue . alright , we go with the l_c_d_ screen ? ' kay . right , i don ' t know if i can find that , but next time . yeah right . yeah , i understand what you ' re saying . we should have a general idea of how it ' s gonna look . right . at the top . i think the top is more uh when you s how do you zap ? you just sit in your chair ? with the remote ? yeah but that ' s where your hand ball might be . yeah , i dunno . we ' ll draw two , and then we ' ll see uh no um he thinks yeah , right . he thinks it ' s better to put the l_c_d_ at the bottom , and i think it ' s better at the top . but your yeah . the the ticker the l_c_d_ is like like small . it ' s it ' s wide . it ' s not not high . but yeah right . but we ' re making a remote with with a few functions you know . we high - tech . width . th that ' s not a problem . when i draw here it oh . huh ? yeah , it ' s off . it it needs to be calibrated again . well where ? alright , we have to make a decision now , because we don ' t have much time . um i think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the l_c_d_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . at the bot so we are two uh v_s_ two . right . great . and moreover i think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the l_c_d_ s . it ' s uh your it ' s your job . yeah , right . alright , let ' s keep it central . mm . right . you should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance . yeah , but what he said about r_s_i_ was t kinda true . when when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you ' re doing the same thing all the time , and that ' s just what r_s_i_ ' s all about . so it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . um frequency of uh button use . um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . you can see . so the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , i think , up and down . you thinking uh about r_s_i_ ? y look at uh look at the frequency . nei not too much , but nei nei nei n i i totally agree . but just yeah . right . yeah . i agree . and should and should be red . right , just make some decisions . the most important things we have to uh i do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . just uh you decide that , you decide that , and ready . yeah . nei . we ' re no we ' re deciding now , so top or bottom ? okay . yeah , right . okay . yeah , okay . no . do you still have the pictures over there ? yeah , that ' s about it . you do need the uh multi or did uh no , like this one . you do need them ? yeah , i know . but are we alright , alright uh now okay . right . yeah , it ' s most useable this way . yeah . right . i do think we have to put that underneath a clip . yeah . okay , right . well if you you take those th if you yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to a_v_ . ah uh well whatever , . yeah , but if we ' re choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new t_v_ . you have to set the channels . right all th these uh different buttons you have to ah , i do . right . that ' s the only one we put uh in there . for a screen uh fu uh channel setting . programme , right . uh ah . great . alright . ah . okay . get into my belly . mm . well , yeah . no . oh . we have forty minutes for this uh discussion ? alright . huh ? yeah . mm - hmm , now it ' s right . it ' s meant to be easily wiped out , yeah . mm - hmm . i i disagree , but uh it ' s not uh t it ' s not my place to disagree i guess . oh , alright . yeah , we are a real fashionable company . i read uh i read it on the i didn ' t know what company we were , but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . so it has to be uh a modern design . that ' s important to know , uh when you design a thing of course . yeah . the order ? no . you can zap away . yeah . oh . oh ? mm - hmm . i think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . uh i didn ' t read it ? oh , alright . users to uh add one ? do you think ? mm - hmm . yeah alright . because they don ' t use it ? alright . well maybe for the if you don ' t recognise a button who d who d who do i call uh wh when i don ' t know it ? isn ' t it part of the of the u no . no . never mind . consider the m yeah . mm - hmm . it ' s going to be expensive . yeah . well we ' ll uh consider it uh . we ' ll think abo we ' ll think no , we ' ll look we ' ll look into that later . alright ? we have very demanding clients . yeah , yeah , alright . well we ' ll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , i think . we don ' t rule them out uh yet . shall i give a technical talk ? alright . well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . we have that here . okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the f_ f_ five . yep . well , the working design , that ' s my uh well alright uh , you know who i am and what i do . so uh we have this . it ' s a bit uh unclear because i wanted to copy paste something . it was originally in black and white but it became black and purple . but i think you can read it . um well um i think it ' s important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . uh well you can see uh and i then can select i can select on the dings it goes to the next page . well , you can read it , it ' s not too difficult . meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . you have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the led , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . and uh the source is of course the user . uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course . and the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the led , and the led sends it to the receiver . that ' s the that ' s the basic idea . very basic . um well i have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps . uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . it does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . the key a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . uh and recognise the key . so well you understand . the chip uh produces morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . and it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the led , which is the bulb , of course . now the led produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it ' s uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the t_v_ set , and the t_v_ set uh also recognises the the the signal , and performs the assigned task . ah bu yeah , but we don ' t . uh we no no , but yeah . exactly . uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . i ' ve some couple of pictures here . it ' s a very basic one . and uh if we if we ' re going to add an uh an uh l_c_d_ screen to it , it uh won ' t look anything like this , but this is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . it has uh very little buttons and but it it uh it ' s it ' s quite um yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . they ' re uh far enough apart and an anything . it ' s not very um uh not very high - tech uh indeed , and it ' s not very user - friendly . uh if you look at the shape , it ' s uh just a simple long box uh shape . so we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user - friendly , and that uh problems like uh r_s_i_ and uh those kinds of thing don ' t don ' t oc don ' t occur . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately you don ' t have to look and and search for them . well you you can ' t have any uh every button under the thumb , of course . yeah . well , . but in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . i think that ' s a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they don ' t use it uh all the time . well it ' s uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said . and i have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh i don ' t want to get too technical , because uh that ' s not uh very uh useful for you . so yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . and uh well that ' s about it i think . oh yeah , i still have this . oh i had to delete this , but i had to make a schematic uh of the of the new but i had too too little time , but uh don ' t uh don ' t look at it please . i i think it ' s it ' s clear uh how it works . alright . that ' s the most important thing . alright . uh right . yeah , uh there are different uh we have all have different home pages , with different links . yeah . mm - hmm . you can ' t really see uh the differ from different sides . but i think uh uh you can draw it if you yeah . we can put it on the on the back side . yeah , so that you don ' t replace the symbol , yeah . mm - hmm . mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the word documents file ? in map ? the younger uh mm - hmm . mm - hmm . i think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh no um mm usually but yeah i think m most most uh mm - hmm . uh . yeah . our competitor . yeah . yeah . yeah . so it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your l_c_d_ screen . but should it uh really be uh clickable , uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . but that ' s of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing . alright . shouldn ' t we start with the most important parts ? the l_c_d_ screen alright but we should start with the power button ? uh huh ? and then uh maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . i dunno what uh you were talking about but we are busy with something . uh - huh . why do you think it ' s better at the bottom ? but you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there ' s room for the for the interface . uh - huh . and and we can bottom . well that ' s a bit exaggerated . well , i agree with you . it ' s it ' s also more recognisable . it looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top . yeah w well , but uh you don ' t have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , uh because i think it ' s uh i think it ' s still important to have it at the top , because it ' s uh it ' s more familiar that way . a little a little bit . maybe you should another pen . maybe that ' s uh better . you e you only have one pen for that screen . yeah . yeah . i i agree . well i ' m the i i ' m the designer , so um yeah . uh we uh we were busy with that . uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . so , we have the power button . yeah of course . uh it ' s uh . yeah . w wh while you have to agree , i can say it ' s like this and you must agree . yeah . channel , yeah . volume control . um well let ' s look at your uh design . uh uh - huh . yeah . but th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a d_v_d_ player or something . so yeah , it ' s it ' s also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . y yeah . it ' s good to move uh from time to time . yeah . no but now y w would we have to choose a way in middle ? mm - hmm . oh . far apart ? i think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don ' t have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . yeah . c c can you make you make we can use uh the drawing board now , i think . uh it it doesn ' t work well but but it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing . mm . alright . well uh yeah i i still think it ' s it ' s quite important though to uh to have it at the top , so yeah . you say familiarity isn ' t important but yeah d yeah . as we we we we agreed , we do have a l_c_d_ . so that ' s that ' s enough . yeah . there ' s one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero . oh , like that . um they ' d recognise it . th that ' s the most that that ' s very easy . yeah . i think these are the the most important functions . basic function . oh yeah . uh just two just two under uh under uh i i think uh but you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . uh that ' s that ' s too complicated . you can just put it somewhere they they aren ' t used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere yeah s bit smaller and s well uh and and i think more at the bottom . yeah . yeah or at the top , yeah . what do you think uh those those buttons ? above or down ? and w where ? well we design it later . we have it , and we design later where everything goes . yeah . the the video channel uh ? no no not always . ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel . but it ' s easy to go if you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . it ' s more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button . yeah well uh d different screen settings a yeah , sk yeah y you you you you have screen width . yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the yeah . yeah . you should yeah . i think that ' s important . uh and and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast . channel , yeah . chief ? chief ? th the menu menu button is also important . then you can uh where ? i don ' t see it . oh menu , alright . in the menu . and you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . because uh the zapping buttons aren ' t used then if you are in the menu . yeah . or the volume , yeah . yes chief . yeah this is this is your thing . i am hungry . see you later mate . well i ' ll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting . okay . i ' ve put some uh new things in the in the map . uh oh . this is it . i don ' t know the shortcut , so ah f_ five . well our functional design meeting , that ' s the stage we ' re in . and you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it . well um in we ' ll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . but uh uh then we ' ll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . i think you have prepared uh all three uh ? um we ' ll look at th the new project requirements we uh i dunno . y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ? oh i ' ve received a mail with uh some additional requirements , and i ' ll have a look if well i think we should show them before your presentations , because it ' s not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can ' t , because of the new requirements . well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . we have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . and then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . uh uh yeah , i think so . well uh the closing uh we ' ll not uh look at it yet . um now i ' ll look at show this board . um well uh notes , first meeting . now . i gave a disc a a presentation . uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . so we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls . we should make it uh compatible with our new d_v_d_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . uh not too many one buttons . one recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . and um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a d_v_d_ and a television . um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . it ' s uh one of our ideas . yeah well that wa it ' s just thirty minutes ago , so it ' s not quite uh but well i have to do it . the materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . it should be uh recognisable at all times . yes . well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones . and uh the technical aspects um and also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . well that ' s just uh some ideas from the first meeting . it ' s quite logical al all of it . um now the new project requirements , i ' ll just show them . i got this mail from uh our bosses . well , teletext goes out . we will not use teletext . maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext . well the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the d_v_d_ and they don ' t want it , because of our time we have for this project . so that ' s a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . because uh we don ' t have those customers a lot at th at this point . um well it ' s a bit pity because it ' s just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it . yeah . well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . so uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . uh not only just uh the shape but also our company . yeah . yeah . yeah . okay . yes . i i uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . it ' s uh we mm put the fashion in electronics . so maybe that ' s a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something . alright then um we ' re going to uh have three presentations . you want to start ? oh you have to start ? i didn ' t see anything about uh who had to start . well s then start . okay . well uh you already uh opened uh powerpoint . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . well it should actually uh it should actually be loose from the television , because it can also be used for other televisions . so if you deliver a small uh click - on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . no you can click it on your television . yeah in another room , yeah . well yes . yeah . well we ' ll have a look at it , yeah . yep . well there sh should always be a menu , but it c can be very short . yes okay . well we are a design team , we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . so well we ' ll have a look . um yes ? yep . well well with twelve euro fifty as production cost , we can ' t uh afford an l_c_d_ uh yeah . well yeah well uh it ' s your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh nigh i know . it ' s not yet a standard uh development uh those so we sh yeah absolutely . yep . ' kay . alright . yes . well you i c i can uh still see your presentation . it ' s in the well uh next um i dunno who is next . you uh got uh yes . well go ahead . yip . f_ five . f_ five . click . yep . yeah . so it is also why we have to have a button that says uh i ' m now busy with a d_v_d_ uh if we had done that . and a button for t_v_ . so well but but if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . but if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , and that ' s on of the things about r_s_i_ . no but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject r_ r_s_i_ r_s_i_ . yes i ' ve saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons . well it it ' s well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote yeah . if someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he ' s a already on the next channel . that ' s very irritating , i think . well . no . yep . mm - hmm . that ' s your part of the job . yep . okay . well we understand . we understand . oh right , no . nice . then uh mike can uh give the third presentation . how late is did we start his presentation uh ? wha yeah . well then we have still the time , so but we do have to come to a decision , right later on . so oh yeah ? uh ? okay , yeah well . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . i like user - centred . yeah . we also do that . yeah . mm - hmm . well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . so we cannot just uh make someone w no but that ' s th the side they look uh look at is the front . so if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone . yeah , we must . yeah well and and yes . ' kay . yeah yeah yeah . or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn ' t changed by the front . those kind of things . yes . okay . mm - hmm . yeah . alright . yeah ? well what if we um i at i at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , a f a little uh you can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don ' t use but s some do do . well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , but not yeah . competitors . yeah . well maybe w we could uh s on um some uh calculators you have lo those little little l_c_d_ th that you can click on or something , or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . and if if that ' s gives you a little bit of sta status information . yeah . those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your v_ v_c_r_s . and uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you ' re currently watching . yeah . for example . it it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . yeah . well maybe . yeah . yeah . r_d_s_s or something . well i think it ' s you got it just means it ' s a script that ' s uh keeps it uh rolling , and it ' s not uh that ' s five minutes off uh implementing time i think uh yeah . no . uh well i think so , yes . um we ' re g no but we ' re we ' ll have to look into that . um we can use this board again , i think . uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue . where is my presentation ? uh uh well i mean we ' re all here now , i think . these i ' ve already given you . so we have to decide on the different remote control functions . so we want to have a small l_c_d_ screen that ' s special . yes . yeah . that thing is terrible . uh well well i th i think mike mike has a point , because um when when uh when i use a remote i l i hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . so and and i i like to use the ones on the top . so when i u when i have to have an l_c_d_ s scr window yes but we we we we don ' t want that . we don ' t want them to look like a calculator . we want to look it like our original but familiar yea maybe a bic uh better uh white uh we white ? width . uh format yeah format ? line width ? width ? yeah ? it ' s a bit off . well . well uh let ' s uh talk about that later uh it ' s special pen . yeah . no . i think it should be at the button , bottom . bottom . the l_c_d_ . yeah . well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design . because we have to decide this . yeah . yes . well we have a power button . guys ? guys ? we have a power button , setting buttons , l_c_d_ window , the number buttons uh yes . uh the mute button . i h love that one . yes . yeah . yeah yeah yeah . well that ' s that ' s also design . yes . um well h ho yes . yes . they are for some uh video uh apart . so people have to move their hand . and they get less uh complaints of r_s_i_ . that ' s what i always do , because all my i important buttons are the same place . yes ? well not yes . uh - huh . up and down far apart from each other ? well not too much . well for example the power button , you can if someone is constantly z zapping , it ' s not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . because i have someone but the buttons is way . so that one can be put away . the power button can uh be uh uh yes . oh man , five minutes . yeah , well five minutes left . yep . um how are we going to do it with those numbers ? well i have it here . yeah well that ' s going to take too too much time . yes . yes . well the l_c_d_ . um you are industrial , you are user interface . so i think it ' s going to go to mike . but you will have to make consensus with . well well it ' s a bit hard , because we are going to be uh individually . that ' s a bit uh yes . yes it is . well what if we ' re going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ? alright these functions . the number f well yes , that ' s alright . w the number function . are we going to uh do it like uh on mike ' s screen with uh one button that says i ' m going to do a t two number digital ? how do you want it to do then ? it it has to r recognise one as there could still come more . yes . alright so no button for that . okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ? so no , we ' d uh just said we didn ' t uh well uh um well because we can ' t integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant . so just for a television is that all we need ? teletext is gone . so all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext oh screen placing . we ' ll have uh those uh buttons about uh and uh the two important ones we ' re l f forgetting . uh there ' s um screen . you can make it wider and less wide . and the button that you can go to a_v_ for your video . those two ? but it ' s just two , and we make a clip ? th that ' s a bit uh waste . yes . or at the top . your l_c_d_ screen is going to go . yes . yeah well i think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote . yes ? yes . yes . well any other uh go to video , that ' s always on your remote control . to a_v_ uh to a_v_ a_v_ a_v_ . well l n no not at not at my remote . yeah . yes . i don ' t . i go to ninety - nine . th that ' s the button uh no . no you can ch push zero . yeah . yeah , i i think that one button is uh i use it uh yeah ? these buttons , i don ' t have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote . it ' s it ' s incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those so we still have one uh four ? ch ch okay . oh the okay button ? oh you always have in the centre an okay button , for your menu . menu button . channel , setting , menu . we have to go . okay . so um save . yes see . yes i have put it in . here . alright . guys ? we ' re going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we ' ll have to decide s things on our own i think . so well see you uh w w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh lunch . ah . we didn ' t exactly do everything but so","there are some new requirements for the project : the device will have to be for tv only , they should ignore the teletext function , as it is dated , and , also , the remote should be recognisable as a real reaction product . the target group will be people below 30 . it transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes , especially if they include lcd screens and speech recognition . functions like zapping are very prevalent , as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose . the function of the remote is relatively simple : by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip , and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver ( the tv ) via infrared . the team agreed to follow a user - centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons . they plan to include an lcd screen to display relevant information . other functions are served by push buttons : ok , menu , screen sizing , av , settings buttons , mute , digits 1 - 9 , power , volume control , channel up / down with the last three types being prominent on the device . the exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting .",TS3009b
"okay . mm . mm - hmm . uh okay . um i ' ve been looking at uh the user interface of it . um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . um okay . mm ? oh . uh . okay . um yeah . i think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . uh uh i ' ve do i ' ve uh done a little uh research on the internet and not much information about it , um about uh interface but uh uh yeah i i ' ve been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . uh so uh you ' ve got a lot of devi uh devices like uh d_v_d_ uh uh television , uh stereo . so um but uh it must be uh user - friendly . so um uh you c you can ' t put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh yeah . uh uh uh yeah . in one um remote control . but um yeah . um yeah . got uh many functions in one uh remote control , um but um yeah you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control . um few uh buttons but uh this uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . um uh people uh don ' t like it , uh so um well what uh i was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . so uh like uh the on - off uh button . uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don ' t have to change that . um my personal uh preferences um . use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . so um wh what i was th uh thinking about was um you ' ve got um uh this the remote control uh and uh you got here the general functions , uh like uh the on - off button uh sound uh i dunno um and um here you ' ve got a s kind of a display . it ' s a touchscreen . so um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a d_v_d_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh . and um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . so um this button is for a d_v_d_ or so um for every um device you ' ve got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . so uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device . so uh that ' s uh my uh idea about it . um yeah and uh let ' s see . uh yeah . so a touchscreen . uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . we better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah . everybody uh have to use it so uh ol even even old people um young people . so uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . so uh um yeah . uh yeah . that was uh my uh part of it . so n i i don ' t think so . uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . s um it ' s uh not uh in colour or something . uh it ' s just uh um one colo uh yeah . uh i seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago . uh you got uh yeah quite an uh a kind of uh touchscreen um and it ' s uh for uh twenty uh euros or uh less uh . so it ' s possible . yeah . yeah that ' s true . uh . okay . mm . mm . yeah . mm . forty yeah . yeah . mm . mm . mm . yeah . but um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . so it ' s yeah . it ' s mm . yeah yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . if it ' s only for televi yeah . yeah . yeah . so we can s we can skip the display , so uh we don ' t need it . uh yeah . yeah . mm . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . mm . mm . yeah . hmm . no . no . no . hmm . mm . hm . no . mm . okay . yeah . yeah . mm . mm . yeah . mm . mm . no . so ' kay . yeah . right . no . yeah . yeah . yeah . yes . yeah . okay . no . yes . think i ' ll go first . ' kay . my name is freek van ponnen . i ' m the market expert . but you already knew that . um i ' ve done some research . we have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . we had one hundred of these uh test subjects . uh in addition we did some market research . uh see what the market consists of . what ages are involved . well these are three quite astonishing results , i thought . um remotes are being considered ugly . f uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy - looking remote control . so um in addition remotes were not very functional . fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . so some things . then we did some research to the most relevant functions . channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . the power button got a nine . and teletext got a six and a half . so these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . then there are some one - time use function . that ' s what i like to call them . that uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . then these are the this is the market . um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . um main characteristic of this group is that they ' re very critical on the remote control . um they like to use new f new functions . but they also are very critical . they won ' t spend their money very easily . so um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market . they are not really very interested in features . but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . um what i think this indicates for our um design . i think we should make a remote for the future . and this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . um the results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r_s_ r_s_i_ . um this is certainly something to take into account . and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . so these are two factors that i think should be included in the design . besides of course that the remote must look very nice . and the functionality as a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , i think we should make very few buttons . uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . uh i think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . ' cause they ' re used most and so they should be robust . they shouldn ' t break down easily . um then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be and i say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . but it might be a good idea to make a docking station . and this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . so you ' d know where it is in the room . and in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an l_c_d_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . this was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . but up till forty five it remains feasible . this would also greatly increase the production costs but i think these are just some small factors we could consider . that would be all . any questions ? ' kay . yeah you should go to the top thingy . slide show . oh yeah . hmm . well it would certainly make a fancy design . so that is true . we would have to look into that . yeah . so is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ? yeah ' cause you ' re you ' re saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it ' s not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . and new t_v_s will have internet access on them . but i think if you ' re targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a t_v_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . so i think it ' s pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . i ' m pretty much against it . yes . besides that , i think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . but i mean if i s if i see this , it ' s i think we ' re just gonna go for another pretty and not innovative remote control . yes but it ' s not the biggest part of the market . and besides that , they ' re not very critical so i mean they don ' t really care what the remote control is like . they ' ll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable . no . i think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control . people of forty plus , i mean they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it ' s okay with them . so i haven ' t heard of it . hmm . yes . yes . but obviously the board tends to disagree . yeah , also . i think it ' d definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . yes . mm - hmm . but i don ' t think that ' s really an issue any more ' cause well might be . but i mean it , if it ' s only for t_v_ you ' re not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . you need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but i think if you if you only l nah . think if you ' re gonna include teletext you do . i think many people like to use that . ' cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don ' t wanna push the next channel button thirty five times . that ' s true but um i don ' t think there are many t_v_s that can switch channels that fast . and so you would need like the t_v_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . and i dunno if many channels would do have that . if many t_v_s have that . mm - hmm . but i don ' t think i think if you ' re gonna make a remote control only to operate a t_v_ , you there ' s not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . ' cause i think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t_v_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . i don ' t think there ' s much to be gained in that area . yeah . that is true but i think there ' s simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you ' re making a remote control only for to operate only the t_v_ . ' cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a t_v_ there ' s simply not a lot of buttons required . there ' s not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don ' t have a lot of buttons either . so i think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . that would that would cost a a big marketing expedition which was one of the arguments to make it only for the t_v_ because we didn ' t have the time to market a lot . maybe . well yeah i think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and but i don ' t think we should spend very much time in that . yeah i think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a like to have extra in a new remote control . yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . yeah that was what i suggested . you have it on yeah you have it ' s on some phones too , which have a docking station . and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing . so you know where it is . i think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we ' re focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . which would tell you what it does . and it wouldn ' t have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , but just a small screen with two yeah . but i dunno if that would that would fit into the costs . no . i think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters . yeah . i think i think that would be a if we should do something like that it would be a , i think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company . and i think , i think there would be a good market for it . if we ' re able to really bring an innovative product . yeah the really but i ' d have to look into that a little more . ' kay . and with uh the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . you could i think we n it would be a lot easier to adapt it to different cultures . yeah . yeah . ' kay . that ' s good . okay . everybody found his place again ? yeah ? that ' s nice . okay so this is our second meeting . and uh still failing ? uh now we ' re going um into the functional design . um important thing of this phase is that we ' re going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . so that we can move onto the second uh phase . but first this phase . um first an announcement . there ' s a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . so there ' s our ghost mouse again . that that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that ' s because of this uh it ' s in wing c_ and e_ . so it should be over in a in a while , couple of days . but it ' s going to be cold anyway , so i don ' t think you ' re gonna need it . then our agenda . now first the opening . uh this time i will take the minutes . uh you ' re going to have a presentation . all of you . um and we ' ve got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . so uh i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me . and then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don ' t wanna include . so we ' ve got forty minutes for all of it . so i suggest um let ' s start with the first presentation . um who wants to be first ? okay . so just maybe it ' s easier if you um yeah i think you will tell your presentation as well . just which function you have and what you ' re gonna talk about . okay . thank you . so anybody have um any questions until now ? about functional requirements ? okay that ' s clear . now to the second . yeah . yeah you can take your time . we ' ve got uh plenty of time , so yeah . there it is . yeah . one remote . hmm . ' kay . yeah . okay . anybody has questions about the technical functions ? yeah . touchscreen . huh . ' kay . that ' s nice . uh yeah . that ' s right . uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation ? uh and then we have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design . i think it ' s going to uh it ' s not too much . okay . okay . thank you . okay . uh okay now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . um i ' m the project manager so i ' m here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements . um that ' s , we ' ve uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for t_v_ . um that ' s because uh it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions . so it has to be simple . uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . and uh it ' s a function we don ' t need in our remote control . um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . uh that ' s the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . um this is uh a bit pity for the marketing uh expert . because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . so we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our uh remote control , and the other way round . and we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . so it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . and uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . so i suggest let ' s have a discussion on the control functions . yeah . uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . um against the no teletext ? um yeah it ' s it is standard remote . no i think we can i think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned . uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . and um if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it ' s the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . no . but don ' t you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think the people think that ' s the the device i ' ve looked for although i didn ' t realise it . so let ' s try it . yeah . yeah . it ' s a big success . very big success . yeah . uh . i think so as well . uh i simply think um uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . and i think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls . ' cause what you told is the channel selection is important . volume selection , power and teletext . okay . um no we we haven ' t voted yet , so uh i think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well . but only if uh if it won ' t higher the the cost , because i don ' t know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but i don ' t think it will be a problem . or is teletext a yeah . yeah . so i suggest uh yeah . is anybody um really against teletext ? no ? just that , that we just keep the teletext . i think that ' s a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . for elderly people they can think , oh i wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles . um so i think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . um functionality should be few buttons , you said . i think uh that ' s very important we have a few buttons . so to keep it simple . no . yeah . but do you need but do you need the buttons for one to zero . maybe c we can maybe we can use uh no , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? or a joystick like ? there are other ways too . just look if you look at telephones . the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or that ' s right . the numbers yeah . yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it ' s too much we can uh reconsider it . but i think there won ' t be very much buttons . or there don ' t have to be a lot . the number of buttons ? i think it ' s very important in the in the design . you can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with to operate only the t_v_ yeah . no . so . ' kay . so we can yeah . that ' s right . yeah . so you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station . uh uh like other functions . instead of f of less buttons . mm . no . do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ? ' cause it can be no . yeah . because i think that ' s uh that ' s a good advantage point as well . if we have a fancy - looking docking station or very that ' s a nice requirement . docking station . i think so . yeah . that ' s a good point . um you said they easily get lost as well . yeah . so maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something . yeah . yeah . yeah . so audio signal should be possible as well . i think it ' s not too expensive . uh another point is the l_c_d_ screen . um i don ' t know if that will rise the cost too much , because yeah . it will be too much as well . yeah . based . just the l_c_d_ . oh just the normal screen . that ' s a good idea . so some extra info . feedback . yeah . i think that ' s a good idea as well . as the small screen . extra button info . i think that should be possible as well . um let ' s see what did we say . mm . more . should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . few buttons , we talked about that . docking station , l_c_d_ . um general functions yeah . ' kay . and default materials . i think that ' s a good idea as well , because um elderly people don ' t mind if it ' s a titanium cover or just a plastic one . so that doesn ' t really matter . so i think we nee uh let ' s um specify the target group . because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . because i think what we ' re going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . uh what do we want ? if we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people . yeah . so that ' s the now you ' re talking about sixty to eighty for example . yeah . sixty . okay . and different cultures . are we okay . no . we ' ve got five minutes left just now . small warning . should yeah . in different languages , you know . yeah . or you have to put a language button in it , but that will be a bit unnecessary i think . it ' s better to put it on different markets with it all . okay . so that ' s the the target . uh then a few small things . uh okay . i will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . um what we ' re going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept , user interface designer the user interface concept , and the trend - watching . so just keep in mind the things we ' ve said about the target group , uh requirements , and the trends which are uh going on . and uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach . so um i thank you for this meeting . and i think we have a lunch - break now . so that ' s a good thing . no . well i think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we ' re gonna go way above the twelve and a half euros . but the it wouldn ' t be very robust . it ' s very fragile and you can get scratches on it . that ' s . okay . okay i ' ve got a presentation about the working design . um first about how it works . it ' s really simple of course . everybody knows how a remote works . the user presses a button . the remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the t_v_ . the t_v_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . so we ' ve got um the the plate . it gots conductive disks for every button . when the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the led and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t_v_ . it ' s a very simple device , technically speaking . so this is a schematic overview . you ' ve got the buttons . the power source . and uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . the chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . well um i think we should use default materials , simple plastics . keep the inner workings simple , so it ' s robust . uh i think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you ' re going to use high - tech materials the price is going to go sky - high . and uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high - tech materials it come back in every product . so it ' s , in my idea , it ' s uh it ' s gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . that ' s it . i think that if we ' re if we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um i don ' t know if you ' ve heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ? yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , i think . we don ' t have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . we just change our focus on the project , and i think we can uh we can sell this . no . uh that ' s a good idea . yeah . and besides that it ' s um if we ' re gonna focus on elderly people they ' ll have to adapt . they ' re not used to using scroll buttons . so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout . it should be possible yes . if it ' s not too fancy . and if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible yeah . yes . so we ' re just gonna focus on the extras ? yeah . like with your key - chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound . yeah . y i um i think we ' ll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , ' cause it ' s uh well i don ' t think they have different television sets uh in uh every country . ' cause yeah . yeah .","the project manager stated the agenda and the marketing expert discussed what functions are most relevant on a remote , what the target demographic is , and what his vision for the appearance of the remote is . the marketing expert also brought up the idea to include a docking station to prevent the remote from getting lost and the idea to include an lcd screen . the user interface designer pushed for a user - friendly interface with large buttons , a display function , a touchscreen , and the capability of controlling different devices . the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements they are to abide by . the team then discussed teletext , the target demographic , the buttons the remote should have , the idea of marketing a remote designed for the elderly , an audio signal which can sound if the remote is lost , lcd screens , and language options .",TS3003b
"ramaro . yeah , participant two . component . yep . so we ' re to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we ' ll use for energy , and the material and interface . for energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . first one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this r_s_a_ and then uh titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we ' re to use push buttons or liquid crystal d l_c_d_ display . and we can use some , moving kind of thing . so , as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . so this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors . and we also want to look at our remote control , so . still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we ' re to in our twelve euros or around that . so we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . so uh we discussed an excuse me . so we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery . and also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can ' t use double - curved shapes . like you can have two curves . uh it ' s i think in manufacturing i guess it ' s problematic . so , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it ' s really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to l_c_d_ which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it ' s more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost . uh uh and also like in if you put a it ' s be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and yeah . yeah . like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and yeah . but full assembly we ' ll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it ' s bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . and this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of l_c_d_s and so we want to mo i mean we ' re we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for s s y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , so uh l so uh it ' s like a yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we ' ll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter ok yeah , that can we we can consider , because like it won ' t take much money i guess , because okay , yep . you have any further questions or ? yeah . yeah , we ' re to go for li and now i think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for really light batteries and with uh good price . yeah , that ' s then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . if we ' re going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology and so yeah , if if everybody in the house n to locate then we ' re to go for some speaker independent technology or something . yep . thank you . yeah . oh . we have uh some limitations . three . so maybe you can use in the end and uh mm . yeah . but it ' s uh but it would be expensive , no ? if you use colour l_c_d_ . uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly . so users have different i mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so so we can just if they want they can just pay another two euro . yeah . yeah yeah yes . if they want like uh so that we can yeah . yeah . just they ' ll get few more things and few more colours . lights , yeah . yeah . yeah yeah . mm . yeah . uh mm . but those people will be really few , no ? so like we can those ah . yeah . mm . hmm . yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something so that like at least um yeah . yeah , that oh . yeah . uh that mm that could be feasible i guess , like so since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah . yeah , yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . uh it ' s hmm . four . mm . yeah kind of um maybe yeah it yeah . yeah . we need to think about mm mm . fruit . even shape ? more yeah . yeah . mm . so these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? or it ' s this you you so did you where ? oh . oh , okay , mm - hmm . it ' s not from mm . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . it ' s more general trend it ' s not particular to the remote control . mm . yeah . yeah but some materials n they ' re to be uh they ' re to be something like solid like they can ' t be really spongy or yeah yeah . yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that ' s yeah yeah that yeah yeah . yeah . yeah , looking yeah fruit . these things can be easily incorporated . we can have t colours or this shape or at least yeah . yeah . mm . yeah . look and feel de hmm . hmm . mm sounds interesting . so , can we highlight the specific features of our yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that ' s we want to follow general trend . yeah . so , do you think hmm . yeah . yeah . that ' s so what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? or they really like they more want these fancy features like feature yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah . uh yeah at least like we can make banana or yeah it ' s it ' s yeah that ' s a we ' re to look for and and s we ' re to see the whether rubber is expensive and d hmm . mm . yeah . maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or uh . yeah . yeah . yeah . even design . so still we want to keep l_c_d_ ? or okay . yeah , then we can yeah , yeah , that user friendly or mm . yeah . yeah . and we just stick with two batteries so it ' s not any solar or yeah yeah j yeah , because yeah . yeah . yeah , we ' re done . yep . okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . uh y getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . mm great . so um i will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy . um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . and also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . and at the end um sammy will give um a trend watching on what he ' s he ' s been doing . it ' s so , let ' s go . first with rama . participant two . mm - hmm . mm - hmm , okay . um i want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . okay . you m titanium it ' s more uh yes so mm uh - huh . okay . okay . okay . okay . uh yeah so okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated . okay . mm - hmm . okay . mm . okay , for the location . hmm . okay . so let ' s now go to the you don ' t have more question ? um mm thank you mm . yeah . yeah , but mm . okay . um yeah . now let ' s talk about uh interface . three . which one ? okay . mm . no . mm - hmm . ' kay . mm - hmm . because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ? okay . so ? uh - huh , okay , so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on l_c_d_ , yeah . okay . and thermodynamic also . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah but that ' s maybe mo too much expensive , yeah . but uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version , but mm - hmm . okay and you think that we don ' t have to make to make them pay more because of uh o or this is okay , so so i it ' s not uh a s base service it ' s a mm . okay . mm - hmm . so m so maybe that ' s if that it ' s a selling point maybe it has to be the base . and you ' ll be different . uh in the train uh , hello uh no . want to change my neighbour . mm . mm - hmm . iradium ? ah sorry . mm . okay . so mm mm - hmm . mm , that ' s a nice world . okay . mm . okay . mm . mm - hmm . okay . so it ' s yeah , marketing expert . participant two ? four , sorry . mm . mm - hmm . s so maybe titanium it ' s not a good idea . mm - hmm . um sorry mark . it seems to be mm - mm . mm - hmm . hmm . you ' re old - fashioned . sorry . okay . mm you have questions ? mm . mm - hmm . okay . no more question ? okay . so mm - hmm . okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for rama uh wil design , um mark the user interface design , and uh sammy uh the product evaluation . uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay . mm - hmm um and i as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction . yeah you ' re right , you have to so you say s s do we agree on that ? yeah . we have to . no . okay , that ' s a good idea . so titanium smell like fruit . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . okay . i i agree with uh this uh now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity - like mm . yeah , yeah . don ' t you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape yeah . mm - hmm . okay . mm - mm . okay , so you explore now that you ' re going to work together these these two . or or spongy an yeah . mm . mm . yeah i don ' t think w i think we have to choose . if we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy but uh it cannot be both . ah you can pretend that it ' s uh titanium . yeah , do don ' t worry , you you you speak with mm mm . okay . so explore a shape . mm i think it ' s what we say , that we have an uh an l_c_d_ with uh information . not uh mm - hmm . mm . mm . okay . yeah , yeah , yeah . mm . yeah . mm - hmm . okay . so are we mm . okay . so see you in thirty minutes . how was lunch ? mm . why ? mm - hmm . w we can use something like you know the whole body ' s titanium but there are some rubber or i dunno some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to you know yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . okay , and still we have mm can we still include the l_ l_s_d_ display ? l_c_d_ yeah l_c_d_ . no , it ' s not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus . okay , so let ' s try it , let ' s t yeah , yeah , it ' s it ' s not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . no more questions . mm yeah , yeah . but still uh l_s_d_ ' s already quite nice , l_c_ i ' m an artist , sorry . so uh , that ' s not i hope that ' s not too much . okay . uh participant number three . uh mm mm uh have a look at this no it ' s yeah . uh so the concept of the interface . generally i developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user ' s manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your t_v_ and remote controls . so let ' s start with this . we got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the l_c_d_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , i don ' t know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm i i don ' t remember so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? or no ? i can see nothing . so that ' s our concept . it ' s called the millennium remote control . yeah . really ? i thought you like it . ah okay just press the button , please uh . yeah , we will not use this . we will not use this . but instead of this i will devise that ' s our concept . and it ' s got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed . and uh what will people say ? they ' ll say it ' s perfect . or what will say ? uh they will say it ' s splendid . and uh e everyone will say i ' ll buy it . and everyone ' s gonna be satisfied . i would make a backlight of the l_c_d_ screen with different colours . not the case . yeah . okay , so let ' s remember there ' s a nokia phone which changeable panels . do you like it ? that ' s why you don ' t have it . that ' s why , ' cause it ' s nasty . no . um , i am here . mm - hmm . ' kay . okay , what uh there ' s one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um ' cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , yeah . we can make it in fact . if if if the okay . mm - hmm , mm - hmm , so uh - huh . so , be an option , yeah . yeah , yeah , yeah . but you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time . and it makes you different , you know ? anyone has their remote controls here ? no ? mm - hmm . okay . uh - huh , uh - huh . could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ? that they can use it in darkness , like . hand light , yeah . mm - hmm . okay . okay . okay . s well , let ' s go on maybe with the presentation . and um the remote control ' s going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? and uh i dunno that ' s a question to you and to mm to mm - hmm . okay , okay . so just just just just think about it um . thank you . uh yeah i just want to say it should be real smart . voice recognition is quite tough . i say don ' t use it , and the control just looks . ' cause i ordered jus to l to l lock it . yeah , sure . mm - hmm . okay , thanks . what is spongy ? okay . okay . so we have to uh for yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ? well , we can make it smell like fruit . yeah . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . could we make a titanium shape ? i mean fruit - shaped . but doub double - curved . okay , okay . in fact i just agreed to make uh to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body . well , okay w we ' ll see . yeah we ' ll see . we ' ll see . we ' ll see . i i really don ' t like this modelling clay ' cause you know it makes some for for i dunno uh yeah um we ' ll look . okay , okay . alright , alright . mm - hmm . yeah . mm - hmm . thanks don ' t be sarcastic . mark . uh rama . ah . mm - hmm . what is a double - curved shape ? uh - huh . the cost . mm like this ? mm - hmm . speech l_c_d_ . seems not , it ' s either l_c_d_ or push - button . ah . the l_c_d_ would the display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . just uh for output , yeah . yeah . i guess no um . so the batteries uh are going to be very light . okay . so this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be ask . mm - hmm . okay . no , it ' s okay . puts less of constraint on what we can do but it ' s always like that . we have dreams and the in the end we find out that it ' s not feasible . anyway . yeah . l_c_d_ . l_s_d_ is something else , and it ' s quite nice as well . so , go on uh artist . hmm . let ' s change millenniums . doesn ' t make sense . this is very ugly . oh no , too much concept . ah . ah , back today . do you think it can come in several colours ? or did the um but not the case . uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff , like yeah , well they like uh something which is uh mm yeah , okay , so that would be the option . i don ' t know i don ' t have a nokia phone , but i don ' t use that but again , uh i might yeah , bu but mm - hmm . kind of upgradable uh remote control . wow , wow . mm . like a chameleon . mm - hmm . because uh i think there are two kinds of people . those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh i ' m going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it ' s like a signature . my remote control is pink . nobody else than me has a pink remote control . and that makes me special . i think i think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . those who wanted to have it pink . no mm no . it might be optional , yeah . the the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . although similar but have something just slightly better . pink mm . yeah . yeah , yeah . you always have your remote . oh , you don ' t ? yeah . you don ' t have your remo wh you you know like for instance take the ipod . it ' s a kind of remote control . uh it ' s white and it ' s so white that you see it from any anywhere . it has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it ' s a colour that we don ' t usually see in a remote control . white . seems important . mm glow in the dark , so okay . yeah . uh - huh , yeah sure . well so i heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that ' s the smartness of the thing . currently we don ' t have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition . i dunno . don ' t touch the remote . but yeah . are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? so for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn ' t want . like with some maybe fingerprint recognition or mm . um mm . okay . so it could be smart in that way . but for instance th i i ' m thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . s since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you ' re more often uh things like that and provide you ways of using them , i dunno , somehow , i dunno , that might be expensive but that might also be a good sales pitch again . the remote that knows you . my turn ? okay , it ' s alright . four , i think . trend , yeah . no uh yes . okay , so i ' m going to talk about trends and um i hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . so , next slide please . so first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it ' s not so uh simple you might think that it ' s easy but uh it ' s not so simple . anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone . we can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired . of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they ' re not only watching the trends , they ' re inventing it , they ' re creating the trend . i hope i ' m going to try to help you on that . this is more risky because you ' re not following the trend , you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don ' t and you ' re out of business . so anyway uh next slide please . uh to be to be quick there ' s a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to . the first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . and uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . it has to be fancy . strangely enough it ' s more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that ' s the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . so as you see uh it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . and finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it ' s not so important that it ' s useful as a remote control . next slide please . uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . if we look back and not uh look at only remote controls i think it ' s important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like paris and milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel or so . and i think of course uh i it applies to everything . that ' s the thing with trends . it it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea . fruit and vegetable . think fruit and vegetable . and uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , yeah . well this so so i think uh uh i when we were talking about rubber , i think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it ' s what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . seems not , seems not . yeah . so think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . i mean and not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like . so that ' s what people seem to yeah i i know it ' s quite far from what you thought but that ' s that ' s fashion and okay that ' s all i have to say . these i ' m sorry . yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , as you know our company is quite big and uh so i ' m just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends that are also well . no , it ' s not it ' s not this this is very general , yeah . but it seems that trends travel across things . the what we sure . yeah . we have to i think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables but we still have to put our chips inside , so of course . this is your problem . this is not mine . yeah , i think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . if if it ' s something like rubber made or i think it it ' s also going to be good . okay ? yep . thanks . mm - hmm . okay . thanks . spongy . no , we don ' t have to , but seems it ' s the trend . again , as i said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . so there ' s no well , that ' s you t can try to convince us . okay . that ' s a good idea , i uh i think i yeah i it ' s again in this uh what i said first it has to be fancy so i think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it i think it ' s a good sell for us because we have it and others don ' t . it ' s fancy . whether it ' s useful or not doesn ' t seem to be very important . maybe you could explore the two option . mm . seems to be . if you have time . for creation . you can paint it afterward . no problem . we have a very large department of paint . you will do it . yeah . the thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are . yeah . that ' s the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing . yeah . classical , we stay classical in that we don ' t reinvent uh the wheel . anyway it ' s very in general i think people uh change t_v_ more often than batteries of their remote control . so . because the trend goes faster than the life of the so it ' s very okay . we ' re done .","the project manager stated the agenda and set the goals for the current meeting . the industrial designer discussed different options for batteries , case materials and shapes , chips , and interface components and also discussed the components necessary for a speech recognition capable remote control . the user interface designer presented his concept for the interface design which he called the "" millennium remote control "" . the user interface designer also discussed with the team color options and how to make a "" smart "" remote which is in tune with the user ' s preferences . the marketing expert discussed current findings from trend watching reports which indicated that there is a desire for products to have a fancy look and feel , be technologically innovative , be easy to use , incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme , and be spongy . the project manager gave the team members their assignments and then the team went over the decisions they had made and discussed whether to use titanium or rubber in their design .",IS1006c
"hmm . that ' s uh strange . yeah . okay . let ' s try this . uh um . mm - hmm . mm . uh no , no . yeah . okay . uh blank . no . uh well i think the the the goal of a remote control is that it ' s it it has an influence on the t_v_ set . and that it controls the channels and the the volume . and uh i i i think it ' s positive if there ' s a a led uh uh a led on the corner of the of the remote . so that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it . and that if you push the button the led uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it ' s working . and uh yeah . uh yeah , but no no no . but i my my experience is that it it it ' s convenient to have that . yeah . yeah . hmm . yeah . yeah well that ' s that are good ideas . uh yeah well the led on the corner , that that indicates that it ' s working . if you push a button . um yeah . and looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . so probably plastic or something . uh mm no . yes . yep . okay . oh . well we will try . where it going ? hmm . uh mm . so now save ? now uh blank ? yeah . yeah , yeah . i ' m not getting anything uh on my screen now . okay . wow . oh . nice . uh at home we have a t_v_ , a video uh recorder , a d_v_d_ player , and a satellite receiver . we have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . that ' s not really ea easy . so it would be nice if we have one for all . and we also had a remote control for our radio set . but um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn ' t know which one was what . and it was uh uh v not easy to use . so we n barely used it . yeah . yeah i think it uh from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . or you won ' t sell it . and um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . and it should work with as many uh as possible of them . yes . okay . nice . an elephant . ' kay . . . pop - ups . what is this , pictionary . uh a bird . bird . yeah . whoo . oh not . oh . okay . okay . yeah . no problem . shit happens . a parrot . ish . he did it before . oh . thank you . uh i will start . uh big one , they are uh not easy to use . um i have one set and uh a remote control , when i dropped it , uh it broke . so that won ' t be uh our goal , i think . and uh g big buttons , m uh that ' s easier to use than uh i think . not all the small buttons , you don ' t know big buttons , positive . all all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won ' t know what they ' re working for . thank you . help also . thank you . the weight . not not too heavy . not much buttons . bust - free . that when you drop it , it won ' t break . like uh some kind of rubber on it . or hard uh hard plastic . uh buttons not too small . uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . uh it between the couch and you can ' t find it . when you push a but a button on the t_v_ , then you hear some uh some sort of bleep . and then you uh , hey there there ' s remote control . next . i have one more idea . just popped up . uh it it won ' t take a lot of batteries . so you don ' t won ' t have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks . okay . thank you . so welcome . the first kick - off meeting . what shall we do ? first the opening , then the rest . what are we going to do . we m have to make a new remote control . it has to be original , trendy and user - friendly . so we will get back th on that . first we have to make a functional design . after that we have to make a conceptual design , and then after that a detailed design . so we ' ll discuss that later . first we have a look at . so first to we have to make a small painting . what have do we have to do . first you can save the documents . we have to do that every time we make something . you can print it . no . and we have to use the pen and the eraser . so now . we all have to use this one . you have to make your own favourite animal . so i ' ll make an example . first don ' t touch that things . you can use the pen . and then you can make um something . um you can change some things . um format , line , and change it . and you can change the colour . so that ' s it . so so and after it you have to save it . now we can make a new one . you have to paint now . so you ' re next . what is going on ? what are you what ? . um is a it is a it is a a duck . yes . hmm . blank , yes . okay next one . oh . very good . okay . very good . so um you can always go back . so that ' s it . so that was two . now next . the budget . the b uh we will sell the t at twenty five euros . and we have only twenty of twelve and a half euro to make it . so now we have to think about what we will make . first i wanna hear from you . uh what are your experiences with remote controls . so f first . is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ? positive . okay . what are your experiences ? mm . so and do they always have that ? it ' s easy to you . okay . ' kay . okay so they have too much . so next . for our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . so what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? what what does it have to have ? not too heavy . yes . yeah . yes . like a phone . okay . so , that ' s . okay . yes . okay . this is it has to be compatible with other things . okay . yes ? no battery use . so more ideas ? no okay . it ' s only the first ideas . so uh what are we going to do now is next meeting is in half an h hour . uh okay . next meeting , half an hour . um , what you have to do . well look on your . and next instructions you ' ll get in your email . so this is the first meeting . see you later in half an hour .","for the first meeting , the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings . the group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform . they discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls , including ease of use , multiple systems and power indicators . they then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote . they would like the remote to be durable , for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries .",TS3010a
"yeah . yeah . yeah . w like plastic with rubber , kind of on top well , there ' s , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , b like a nokia it is . it ' s yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah , tha backup . yeah . that would be good yeah . maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power . so maybe that could be incorporated as yeah . do , do those calculators yeah . i don ' t know how it works . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah , i suppose . yeah . yeah . thanks . oh . it ' s not on my screen . why ? you don ' t know why ? oh okay . is it that one ? um , i ' m just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . uh , first of all i ' ll explain what a user interface is . it ' s the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or by the human user . and it ' s also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data . um , there are two types of user interfaces . there ' s the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . so that ' s sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about . yeah . i ' m not really sure about the pictures that maybe that ' s on an l_c_d_ screen . or maybe it ' s the the buttons or pictures or something . do you think it ' s yeah . yeah . so you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . like an l_c_d_ screen . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . no i think it ' s to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that ' s on the buttons of the remote control , and per well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen . yeah . but um i think we ' re gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic . but the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points , as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe . like i can ' t think of an example , but sort of like little pictures rather than like a little sound . instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something . yeah , something y yeah m perha yeah . yeah . maybe . um , the co uh we ' ve decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . as it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user - friendly . um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we ' d have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . you know , make it more trendy and original . we ' ll have more money if we keep it simple . yeah . seeing as it ' s quite a new technology . um we , we also have to keep in mind when we ' re designing our , um , more user - friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms aren ' t always helpful . yeah . yeah . and that all interfaces are different . so , um , that doesn ' t improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that ' s easy to understand . and maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use . does anyone have any questions ? mm . but um yeah . in the phone that i was thinking of as well , when you change the um covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber . so you can change the buttons when you ' re changing the faces . do you know what i mean ? ' cause it ' s just the wee control , yeah , thing that ' s behind it . so i mean , we don ' t have to decide on one colour . each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ? yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . so that ' s everything , then ? yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah . yeah . yeah . or banana - shaped . yeah . where do you have to save it to ? okay . just escape i think . yeah . yeah . hope so . yeah . yeah . i don yeah . yeah . it ' s for the lighting , yeah . yeah . yeah plastic coat . we decided on the component . i , i i ' m sorry , i ' ve lost my um powerpoint thing , so i can ' t remember what it ' s ca it ' s the component the command inter the command line interface yeah . yeah . um , i think that is well we haven ' t really made any decisions about what we ' re gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use . like what what are ideas to combat these problems ? you know how um different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have . we haven ' t really decided what to do about that . well it ' s just um w where where shall we locate the buttons . what kind of functions wi shall we have ? so pretty just just the basic button functions . yeah . yeah , each television . you don ' t change that often , yeah . yeah . yeah . it w it would seem silly if we ' d having anything else , just have an audio button though . do you know ? but we yeah . that could be a sales pitch . simple and yeah . yeah . what i what i was thinking what do yous think of this ? um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle . like grapes . like that ' s kind of fruity or something . that ' s just yeah . okay . yeah . okay . okay . thank you . should be just loading . okay . oh , although i can ' t see it on my screen . that says go here . okay . i ' ve been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what ' s available to us f to actually make the remote control . um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . which is not necessarily a battery , as we ' re about to see . um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we ' ll be getting them from , what they ' ll be made of . um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . which is where all the main information is uh contained . um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . um , and all their positioning in the circuit . uh , these , they ' re all different options , they ' re all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . we can go into that later . um , all the other things are individual components that we ' d have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . and the l_e_d_ of course , that ' s a light emitting diode . so , we could , so we ' ve got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well . okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . we could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . and they ' re not so great to dispose of , environmentally . there ' s a hand - powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . a bit out of date . kinetic energy is something that ' s been recently developed . um , where you manually charge up the power . like you wind up something . sorry ? yeah . every once in a while i think . but it ' s yeah . it would be like going a step back in time . i don ' t think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that ' s being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . i mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . um , or there ' s solar power , which we ' ve been considering inside a building , which is where it ' s gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . but , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way . um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . that ' s got a lot to do with the ergonomics . like how it ' s comfortable and s sits in the hand . we don ' t want something that ' s huge and you can ' t pick up . or too small . or too slidy . i know i ' ve had a remote control before which you couldn ' t tell which was the front and the back , ' cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that i ' d be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . because you can ' t really see which way round it is . um , we also can choose what materials um , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti - r_s_i_ . it ' s like the same sort of rubber that ' s used in stress balls and things like that , so it ' s very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . wood . um , again , stepping back in time again there . i don ' t think that ' s quite up to date with what we ' re looking for here . um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . but , would ' ve been maybe for future projects . um right our choice for buttons as well . we ' ve developed some we ' ve got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . i think that was brought up for , um , they ' re basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don ' t have to use individual buttons . you can just slide up and down . i ' m sure we ' re all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads . yeah . that ' s true . and that would lead to an advanced yeah . if we have yeah . we ' re going on to that later with the advanc with the l_c_d_ that means we ' d need a really advanced chip . and it ' s unlikely that that ' s gonna be in our budget . um , also we ' ve got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we ' re most familiar with . it ' s the most straightforward . but you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . . got decisions to make there . and this is what i was just saying before . linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . um simple would go with the pushbutton . um , regular you could link with the scroll button . and the advanced we ' d have to go with a l_c_d_ s display . my personal preferences ? i think we could go for the kinetic energy source . i don ' t , i think that ' s quite um an advanced kind of technology . it ' s not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . and also energy saving ' cause you ' re producing the energy , you don ' t need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . you just give it a shake . sounds brilliant to me . rubber casing i thing would probably the best , if we ' re going for the anti - r_s_i_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . like it could be pretty much any colour we want . um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . and probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no l_c_d_ , ' cause we probably can ' t afford that one . mm - hmm . i think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . and the rubber would just be the , what ' s in contact with the human . yeah . yeah . maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . so , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable . yeah . like i can ' t think of what . yeah . or like an you can get sort of outer casing for ipods and something , that ' s just it ' s protective as well . it , it stops it , i mean , it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , ' cause it wouldn ' t damage itself so easily . i think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe . yeah . and then yeah . yeah . yeah . as far as i know . it should be . yeah . yeah , yeah . yeah . i thought that was yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . like as a backup for something . yeah . yeah . some alternative just in case something went wrong . that ' s true . i just thought of that . yeah . yeah . may maybe that could be the backup . instead of a battery . like solar backup . yeah . i suppose s but some but thing is , it ' s not you don ' t need the solar all the time . it can be stored . it can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . it just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day . like a few hours a day . . that ' s true . it could easily yeah . i suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , i forgot to charge my remote today . like if the kinetic thing , i think what ' s best about that is that it ' s instant energy . you don ' t have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever . and it works . yeah . instead of you don ' t have to like make sure it ' s in the right place to charge and . k okay . yeah . there we go . it wasn ' t on mine either . i don ' t know why . i think , i just , i just used the mouse on there . yeah . mm . yeah . so i suppose sometime after you . mm . i s i suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol . and if you wanted to go onto teletext or , i know we ' re not having that , but i mean a similar thing , you , they have there ' s a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which i suppose it ' s that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button . but if we ' re having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won ' t have to focus so much on that . it ' ll be more the on the numbers and the volume . i suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that . i for inp mm . yeah . yeah . that ' s true . that ' s in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things . it can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming . yep . oh . i ' d assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . so there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something . yeah , yeah . it should be able to mm - hmm . li yeah . mm - hmm . i think it would be possible . i don ' t think it would make that much difference . i mean , the uh the dimensions of it . ' cause if it ' s just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . you can like take off the hard cover and then there ' s the like say the buttons . and then you get to the circuit . i don ' t think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . i ' m sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty . i ' m sure that ' d be fine . okay . you ' re not plugged in yet . mm . it is strange . well we i think we possibly could take a more abstract design . like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . and then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . i mean we don ' t have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . or a strawberry seed or a leaf . or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that ' s fits in more with what we ' re doing . instead of fruits and vegetables , just if you look at it straightforward , it ' s a bit yeah . it doesn ' t s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that ' s the current theme . but may maybe we could go more directly , i don ' t know . but initially , i dunno . i think if we just sort of tone it down a bit . yeah and like not , not yeah . mm . yeah . i didn ' t for the first one . but i have now . yeah . uh , hopefully . project documents i think . okay . ' kay . kinetic yeah . are we going to have a backup ? or do we just i think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy , and be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and well hope that it works . i think yeah . i think no . i , i think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . go for it . it could be fully kinetic energy . yeah . is everyone happy with that ? yeah . um , it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . and that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so yeah , it was so that was without the l_c_d_ . so that means we ' re not doing the advanced . so it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons . uh , so that ' s the simple . yeah possibly . so , it ' s probably gonna be the regular chip that we ' re going to need . so it ' s a medium . so regular chip . regular sorry . regular chip . lighting . yeah if we because of the lighting that we ' ve decided to put in as well . so th i think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber . rubber . yeah . plastic rubber coat . interchangeable , yeah . still going for that . yeah . your screen ? was it ouch . the power . volume . may yeah . tone , contrast , and things . that ' s a bit yeah , it was minima well , it wasn ' t the l yeah . that would be good . yeah , and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television , so mm . i think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself , doesn ' t it ? i ' m sure it has its own buttons , so you don ' t necessarily need to have it on remote . yeah . so we ' re just going for power , channels , volume , mm . i ' ve yeah , that ' s it . we can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . yeah uh i brilliant . mm - hmm . okay . um , i just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , i thi i think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that ' s what the surveys brought out , i think that we should probably go along with that . um , so i suppose that ' ll come out in our dev design development . but you ' re happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ? y yeah . we can have a look at those ideas , yeah . yeah . yeah . tricky . a lot of things to consider . hm . okay . okay . thank you . is everyone ready to start ? okay . great . well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i ' ll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . okay . um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we ' ll have your three presentations on what you ' ve done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . and , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we ' re gonna make it , what uh materials we ' re gonna use , and that sort of thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long . and um we will once again have poppy as our first presenter . alright , and i will switch up powerpoint . okay . um are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ? yeah . mm . um what is a hand - powered dynamo ? just every , every once in a while ? just every once in a while or constantly ? alright . it ' d be kind of strange to always be cranking it i think . no . right . right . mm - hmm . yeah . mm - hmm . um one thing with the scroll buttons though . it , it we would have to have an l_c_d_ um display , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult . yeah . right . yeah . uh . yeah . um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as like as the exterior . this is the one thing that ' s protecting its innards . yeah . another thing is it might be more difficult if it ' s a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . um , is it i don ' t see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . like if it was sort of like a clip - on plastic plate . it would work that way . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . alright . so maybe the yeah . yeah . yeah . that sounds good . i , um , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ? okay , we ' ll just say yeah . yes , just why not . alright . i like the kinetic energy source idea . um , i don ' t know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot . but i think that it ' s worth it , kinetety , kinetic um energy source . it could make an we could have any kind of style . it wouldn ' t be as heavy or bulky , and yeah . just for environmental reasons . yeah . yeah . yeah , you can watch a t_v_ in the dark then . yeah . i think that might be a little impractical though . yeah . like people don ' t wanna have to worry about that . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . or just like pick it up when you ' re gonna use it . yeah . alright . cool . ' s that the end of your presentation . alright . thank you . yeah . that ' s um oh . okay . yeah . hmm . yeah . yeah , ' cause i ' m sorry ? um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . you ' re pressing the numbers for , um , for what you want . yeah , we ' ll be doing yeah . it ' d be more a command interface , and then yeah . hmm ? yeah . i think they ' re talking about l_c_d_ type things . yeah . yeah . what do you mean ? oh yeah , like how the buttons yeah , as a button though . so , it ' s a keyboard in the shape of it , right ? okay . yeah . i like that idea . yeah . i ' m sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget . a bit more too , yeah . mm - hmm . do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look . yeah . yeah . but what about the lighting up effect ? um , well , um , i thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they ' d all light up . and so if they were black , it wouldn ' t be possible for them to light up . if they were white they would glow , probably . if they were made out of rubber . oh . where would the light come from ? yeah . yeah , and well rubber is a more translucent product too , so we have that taken care of . oh . mm . well , if they ' re raised up buttons . so that you can feel them . we were talking about it being more um , a lot more tangible . um , it might be more difficult to do . if they ' re , if they ' re sticking up . if it ' s flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it ' s like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but yeah . yeah . okay . alright . if it ' s do - able we can do . yeah , sounds good to me . alright , thank you . that means you ' re up . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah , it ' s the fruits and vegetables is the only area that i find rather jarring . everything else we can really , we can really um , do , according to our plans already , given the market . but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control . yeah . yeah . but they still need to um fit into people ' s decor though . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . tone it down . yeah , like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product . mm - hmm . yeah um alright , given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions . so i ' ll need to um hook up the powerpoint again . but it ' s still around right ? okay . okay . i ' m just trying to make this pop up now . alright . here we go . okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do . so energy , we oh . oh no i can ' t write it in when it ' s in this setting . does anyone know how to take it out of um , yeah . yeah . okay . um , so back to decisions . energy , we ' ve decided on kinetic , right ? okay , so that ' s good . hmm . but would a backup really be necessary ? i mean will people just use the battery if there ' s no , if there ' s , if there is backup . yeah . yeah . there ' s like no reason why it wouldn ' t work , right ? yeah . it could even be one of our selling points . yeah . yeah . environmentally conscious or something . yeah . alright , the next um decision is chip on print . i don ' t exactly know what that means . right , and we were going for more simplistic style , right ? yeah . i think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ? yeah . would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ? yeah ? okay . that ' s called medium , or regular ? ' kay . okay , and cases . um , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it ' s made of , or what ? yeah . well , i guess plastic and coated in rubber . plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable um yeah , interchangeable plates . okay . user interface concept . this is your time to shine . oh , yeah . yeah . command interface . did you say command line ? okay . line interface . alright , and supplements . what ' s that all about ? um mm - hmm . um , what are our choices here ? you mean like we ' ll have the numbers of the channels , and we ' ll have the channel - changer , and volume , and power ? um yeah . like i don ' t know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have um , yeah . yep . yeah , it was hardly ever used really . yeah . and most televisions will come with a remote . yeah . ' kay , well we know we want numbers . yeah , it does . yeah , and different televisions . like we , i don ' t know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of changes like that . volume . yeah . oh . we have five minutes to finish our meeting . crap . okay , um , let ' s do this fast . um should we have audio ? it only comes up on mine usually . yeah , i don ' t , i it ' s , it ' s a problem with the international uh appeal , i think . um , if we have audio because we don ' t know how other televisions work . but we know that everyone has this and it ' s the same . yeah . yeah . alright . good . and , okay , in closing , ' cause we only have five minutes . we ' ll be meeting again in thirty minutes . um , you ' ll be working , poppy will be working on the look - and - feel design . wait a minute . is that right ? yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . and you ' ll be evaluating the product . um , poppy and tara will have to work together , using modelling clay . and , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen . alright . so , anyone else have something to say ? yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . five . . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . yeah . lots of yeah . alright . ' kay we ' ll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then . alright . and , um , we ' ll reconvene in thirty minutes . ' kay . bye . i ' ll see you later . oh , what did i just do . okay . yes . mm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . like the skin ? yeah . okay . so the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . okay . and the buttons obviously are rubber . okay . mm - hmm . i guess it ' s a bit scary ' cause it hasn ' t been done before . so it seems we ' d have to do more research on it . or i dunno if you could have a battery pack . yeah so there ' s there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries i believe . so , if it was running off of one battery as a right . although it needs some light , doesn ' t it ? so , if we ' re doing yeah . if we ' re yeah . yeah . i think sometimes it ' s just shoved under , under a cushion , and yeah . yeah . so it ' s just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ? the infrared is like , that ' s considered a okay . so when it says pointing device that doesn ' t include okay . okay . mm - hmm . mm . i think if we go with the um design plate thing , we ' ll have to . just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , so and , and we might , i mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons . you mean different colours for the lighting or mm - hmm . oh i see what you ' re saying . well y oh so you ' re picturing the light is coming from the back . i kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards . but , but i guess , you mean from the back . okay . okay . right . mm - hmm . oh . yeah . they , they insert over . okay . t okay is that my turn then ? alright . i have a shorter report for you today . um , it took a while to get this , uh uh . oh . that ' s a very good point . okay , so um , this report is about uh trend - watching . um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . sorry . there we go . um so , just so you know , my method was mainly web web - based research this time around . i also spoke with fashion experts in milan , new york and paris . and i looked at the design reports from previous years , here at real remote . um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed . um , so i ' ll list the three most important aspects that i ' ve come across . um , and they , they ' re each more important than the one that comes after it . uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look - and - feel , instead of the current functional look - and - feel . um , this should be our priority , as we ' ve been saying . the second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . so , i think we ' ve done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the face - plates . um , so it looks like we ' ll be able to keep on track with that . and the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use . so , pretty basic there . and the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion - watchers in paris and milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . again , we ' ve already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons . um so , my personal preferences here , um of course , as we , we ' ve already talked about the personal face - plates in this meeting , and i ' d like to stick to that . the fruits and vegetable themes , i don ' t know if that ' s going to work for us . it sounds something that you ' d use on kitchenware . i don ' t know if we wanna do it on remotes . it could be one of the options . maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . um , the temporary light - up idea , sounds like we ' re gonna stick to that . and then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user - friendliness . mm - hmm . it ' s , it ' s a little but it , it ' s everywhere . so maybe we i ' ve seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know . but i i think , i think if we stick to t_v_ based , you know , maybe t_v_ shows , or or colour schemes . right . yeah . the the essence of strawberry . yeah . i guess , yeah . one thing i was thinking though is i dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . so maybe there could be animal - based , you know . because a lot of people have a house cat . or , or a dog . um , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face - plates are . but it ' s something to keep in mind . and , did you have any questions ? pretty straightforward ? okay . there you go . have you guys been saving your powerpoint presentations to the okay . the powerpoint ? so so if it ' s not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? okay . mm - hmm . oh , is regular not simple ? right right right . think it was called command interface . command interface , . mm - hmm . that was on , um one of my presentations . about how often it was used . do you remember that ? i w should i bring it up ? the ch t screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour . so tw twice every once every two hours . um , and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten . that ' s brightness , colour , tone , all that . mm - hmm . the other one was audio settings . mono , stereo , pitch . i mean i sometimes use that . some t_v_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um and that , they say that ' s used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . like almost once an hour . um , relevance of two . well that didn ' t some up on mine . oh . yeah i guess that it affects the marketing , ' cause it , mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren ' t you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . this one has channel , volume and your channe and your power . yeah . okay . mm - hmm . yeah . now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gonna come up with casing ideas ? like f five different mm - hmm . yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it ' s true . yeah . i guess what you i ideally you ' d kind of think of age markets as well . so it ' s a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . something that your granny would want on her remote control . um , and international tastes as well , so not easy . okay .","the project manager opens this conceptual design meeting and gives them the agenda . the industrial designer presents first and talks about the components of a remote , energy source options , and materials for the remote , case , and buttons . the interface specialist presents the interface concept by explaining the difference between graphical and command interface . they decide the command interface is most useful for a remote because it is simpler and more user - friendly . the group discusses aspects of the user interface including the lighting up effect and material of the buttons . the marketing expert presents on trend - watching and talks about how fruit and vegetables are an important fashion theme this year , and says the material used is expected to be spongy . the group discusses how they could implement these fashion trends into the design , then finalizes a few decisions about the components , materials , and energy sources . the project manager closes the meeting , stating what each member ' s next task will be .",ES2015c
"ah , pinball . huh . uh , maybe i ' ll have something in my uh presentation . and you will see it . i ' m next , okay . yes . no . here we go . uh , at first we will uh i will f uh say something about what younger people want , our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . and then , i ' ll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . first uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . like , totally yellow , totally red . uh , so it ' s visible . uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . maybe it ' s nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . but to give him the shape of your hand , so you it ' s easier to use or something like that . but that ' s just an idea . and then , i ' ll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . the battery , there are few options . uh , i think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . so , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . when you uh shake it a few times , it it ' s loaded . uh , the the form of the remote control , i think it ' s also nice have it curved . and maybe like it ' s hand - shaped . uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . uh material , you use plastic . hard plastic uh because uh it won ' t have to burst uh like in the in one time . and also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . uh the push - buttons . we have one new thing uh discovered . it ' s a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . maybe it ' s uh easy to use uh for the channels . when you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . and also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it ' s also uh easy to use . just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . and that ' s also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . you can do it with your thumb . and with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one , you can see channel one . the electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . there are also uh simple chips . they are uh cheaper . um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and i think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won ' t buy it any more . they have seen enough of it . and you have also advanced um chips . but that ' s with the l_c_d_ uh screen . and the costs will increase a lot more . and i think our budget is too low to use and an l_c_d_ , and the chip who is more expensive . and maybe it ' s also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . you have any more questions about this ? i think the main thing is we look at the costs . and not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has . not with an l_c_d_ . no . yeah . but then , what i say , the costs will uh get a lot higher . th then you ' ll see it on the television . yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it ' s like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . mm - hmm . yeah , i think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control . yes . but that won ' t be a problem . i think . no , but then we ' ll get to the regular uh remote controls . and i think , what i said , everybody has them uh has them already . and they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two euros . uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . and i think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . i got it on my screen and it was uh higher . but i don ' t know uh how much higher . that ' s true . but then we ' ll i think we must discuss who uh what will be better . if we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . with a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a l_c_d_ . and then a flat um remote control . or , a more hand - shaped remote control , with scroll , without l_c_d_ . i can uh look on my uh uh note that the push - button requires a simple chip chip . a scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . the display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . doesn ' t say . that ' s from my manufacturing division . yes ? changing covers . nope . uh , uh - uh . how w how we how we make it ? uh shouldn ' t we first discuss about like what w we all yeah , but if i paint with more like something m like yeah i can ' t dr i can ' t draw it . uh i have to . i ' m not a designer . it ' s more three d_ . like , um when you have a part here . this is the remote control . and then you have something like th this under it . so , it ' s easier to get it like this . it ' s like a gun . and it has to be soft , yeah . so , you can squeeze in it and sorry ? buttons on top of it . and here . the scrolling . you can do it with your thumb . but now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . one till uh uh zero till nine . and the b yeah ? or two buttons . if uh ' kay c if we do if we use one , then we ' ll have just a switch on it , and you ' ll just switch it , and now it ' s the sound to switch back with the menu uh button . and then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . because uh , from h hundred uh remote controls , ninety nine have it . uh , then we have it on the t_v_ , the menu . i don ' t know . it ' s like some sort of uh teletext option , but we don ' t have teletext . and if we put an l_c_d_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . ' kay . but you all like this kind of thing . uh with the scroll button . and and this one has to be soft . and this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . or some kind of rubber around it . yeah . yeah . ah that ' s nice . here . trigger . paint it ? with the scroll thing on , like this ? so ? draw it . but is it easy to use ? when you have it on your left side , and separate , more separate , h yeah . yeah . on the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button . but would it be easy to use then ? if it ' s like you have a big uh i also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . they were like round curves , uh different uh okay , okay , okay . mm - hmm . personally , i think two scroll buttons uh aren ' t easy to handle . with the switch button . no like uh oh , you mean like that . uh , then you can also have like uh th um yeah , and joystick , i think . yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . a little bit bigger , with easier thi i don ' t know . or no scroll uh things . just a shape . and no , no . it won ' t work . yeah . uh - huh . or a remote control more like joystick . a small one like this , like a nintendo uh k playstation thing . no , no , no . i mean the the shape of the remote control . just like a playstation thing . yeah . no , that ' s okay , i got uh they ' re not uh in details . it ' s more expensive or less expensive , huh ? then i have to come with it . i got my personal costs . i i don ' t i don ' t know the costs . then i ' ll uh make something up . yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . yeah , i think it ' s uh , yeah , more expensive . yeah . okay . depends on the scroll . if we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . if we don ' t use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . and that ' s uh the most expensive . yeah . if we yeah . if we no okay scroll - wheel . so , i have this . so , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip . or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? and then just put also on l_c_d_ on it ? just use your thumb . if you yeah . i use my thumb . yeah . if you have a joystick on no , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh playstation uh game controller . and you move up , f forward , down , left . then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . it ' s not just uh straight . that ' s how we use it . that ' s why they make joysticks like that , i think . yeah ? ' kay . here ' s our designer . yeah . yeah , why not . it ' s for the younger people . it ' s something new . now we put uh rubber around it . hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . and the uh the hand shape is also rubber . huh . this is something new . costs are okay . oh , that ' s us together . yes . ' kay . bye bye . okay . well , let ' s start . what are we doing ? oops . okay . okay . not doing . uh very good . okay . we have presentations . so first , it ' s your turn . yeah . isn ' t it amazing . industrial designer . interface concept . can you go back one page ? for the uh menu , what do we use for that ? we don ' t have buttons for the menu . or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel . okay . but uh you have to put it on the yeah . yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . mm - hmm . yes . the second one . okay . not too much colours . no , it ' s not flower power . s okay . okay . thank you . so , you ' re next . hmm . no , isn ' t . but the l_c_d_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push . but then it ' s not easy to use scroll uh wheel . if you don ' t hmm , yes . but then . yeah , then you go one down one up . when you scroll . yeah but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . so you may not be uh no . the television must do that . so yeah but young people have to have all their uh room . and mostly they are smaller . so most the times that are not advanced televisions . okay . that ' s important . yeah . maybe you can look how how much it is for the l_c_d_ . it ' s very important . yeah , more expensive . but how much ? oh . okay . okay . well , thank you . next . no . it ' s clear . so now , it ' s uh ah , let ' s see . now , w we have to decide well , we have to decide on the concept . so , we have to look at ' s next . components and user interface concept . so now , we have to make some concept . maybe one of you can paint it on the board . first , uh user interface . yes , a concept on uh just yeah , but maybe we can paint it . uh , what do we want ? i ' ll paint . okay . well something like this ? or shapes or what do we need ? yes , okay . okay . and you have to . yeah . so , it has to be soft ? okay . and uh , the buttons ? buttons . no , it won ' t . but , well there one for the sound and one for the channels . uh , two scroll uh wheels . that ' s th that ' s more difficult . it ' s better in but if we don ' t have a l_c_d_ we don ' t have a menu . yeah , but again maybe th how do we know the t_v_ can handle it ? you don ' t know . so , there ' s no menu . no . so you can ' t use it . okay , we make two concepts . one with l_c_d_ . one without l_c_d_ . good concept . but that ' s one . it ' s one . two . number two . no . but when you handle it , you put it on and off . it ' s not good to use . yeah , but i ' ll zap . fuck . out . no , it ' s not good . now , second concept . one with l_c_d_ , one without l_c_d_ . then uh paint it . one with two scroll buttons and one with without . yeah . uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . and the one with with a menu has an l_c_d_ . unbelievable . do i have to do everything . blank . you have not so difficult . uh , that ' s the menu . there for the l_c_d_ screen . you have to for the menu . mm - hmm . one that way . and one that way . so then it depends on the cost . s on and off . when it ' s not too big . just like a a phone . yes , okay . very good . is it better ? when you uh the menu , you have to go there there there there . yeah , okay . that ' s that ' s the outside . but now the first the buttons . sorry ? mute . and the other . yeah . not so difficult . but how do you wanna solve it ? yeah but on the menu that ' s not uh easy . then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down . yeah . a joystick . yeah . but is it uh does that break , a joystick ? or a small one just like in a laptop . mean , it ' s better . but how expensive it is ? oh . why do i pay you for ? um , well um better ideas . for the young peoples i think scroll button ' s good . so think we have to keep them . yeah , but is it that ' s not expensive than uh joystick is better . a small one . no just like in a a laptop . small , round . then it ' s not so big . oh the sh yeah , but then you can you have to use t with one hand . so maybe , if it ' s possible , it ' s not too expensive , i think a joystick is better . a small one . so , please look at it . yeah we i think you get it . so , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it . yes . your problem . not mine . okay . so , do we have other concepts ? then for the components , we use a normal battery . then it ' s ch cheapest way , i think . no , no kinetic . kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . so we use a normal battery . chip . depends on the l_c_d_ . scroll . yeah . and uh , we if you use the l_c_d_ , we have to yes , okay . so , depends on the l_c_d_ and the scroll . okay . okay . so , uh the shapes of the design depends on the l_c_d_ and but , it has to be small . i think . if you have pistol , it l_c_d_ ' s not easy . y y yeah but if you use a phone . k yeah , but but then you have it . like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . and the screen is well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen . yeah . no . no , no . yeah , but then you look forward . and then you can y n well , if you have to look at it . then it goes like this . if th n well yes , of course . that ' s good good . but the um , it may not break . okay . if that ' s possible . okay . yeah of course . okay . then this is the design . and the buttons are on the next page . so , depends on the cost . so , um we have one minute . i think . no . more . seven . next meeting . thirty minutes . so hurry up . you two stay here . paint it . now you have to . so i think it ' s clear . check your mail . so it has to be ready in the next meeting . so next meeting is called the detailed design . so everyth everything has to be ready . thanks for your attention . hmm . oh . mine . oh , great . uh yes , well uh let ' s uh talk about the interface uh concept . uh , first i ' ll uh i ' ll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . and uh my personal preferences . well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . the bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . the channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . and the menu menu button to man manipulate the l_c_d_ uh display . um , i found some uh interesting uh uh samples . examples . um , well uh what ' s pretty standard is uh that it ' s that they ' re all pretty uh uh high uh yeah . yeah . large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . like there . and uh yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . and what ' s interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don ' t use that . but uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . uh this is the v_ for volume , but they ' re both uh a v_ . so it ' s it ' s not really very uh clear what ' s the function of that . um yeah . so , that ' s uh , well yeah . i thought that was our uh idea . so , uh how like this . or or this . and that the menu button is okay . yeah , okay . uh , so the the icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . yeah . uh , well that ' s something to uh think about . okay . um , well i don ' t i don ' t know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . but uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , i would uh recommend a yellow case . uh , round edges . the logo at the bottom . and uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . so , it ' s good . uh , recognisable . k so , i think . uh , no . not too much . but uh no , no , no . but this has to be has to be trendy and uh and uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . that was that . hmm . no . mm , yes . what ? mm . yeah . but but i that ' s the only scroll uh button on it then ? yeah , okay . but but how yeah . how okay . mm . yeah . mm - hmm . and you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . like uh just to uh oh , like a yeah . but if you put push the the menu button yeah , wh what yes , but you don ' t know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . yeah . mm - hmm . mm , yeah . yeah . it ' s uh or you can uh turn it inside . but that ' s no , that ' s true . . okay . cookie . mm . ah . hey . ah . now i have my screen back too . yeah . yeah . very interesting . large . a lot a lot of buttons buttons . yeah . yes . okay . okay . mm - hmm . hmm . yep . yeah . but , thi i uh this is with an l_c_d_ ? no , not . uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with l_c_d_ or without ? ' cause it i think if we have an l_c_d_ , it will also sell a lot better . and that might uh bring back the costs uh huh . ' kay . my turn ? mm . so so yeah . so , my uh presentation is about trend - watching . uh , i did some trend - watching . it ' s very important to uh keep up with latest trends . ' cause if you don ' t , you won ' t sell . so , well how we did do that ? uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by trendwatchers . they uh watch in uh cities like uh paris and milan . of course , well known for their uh trend uh trends . and well , uh what did you find ? uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . and um , material ? that should feel have uh a spongy feeling . and to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it . then the old and rich . they like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . and um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . now , another picture . to get a feeling for this . well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . we uh aim at the younger market . so , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . however , with trends it ' s always if there ' s it ' s now . it it it might last one year , and next year it be uh can be totally different . and i think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . so , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . so , that ' s uh one thing to keep in mind . yeah . any questions ? yeah . mm . can make several uh concepts . we have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand . yeah i i i uh yes . yeah . a g mm . . yeah . and i if we go to uh but if we have uh a me yeah . if we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ? yeah . uh - uh . uh - uh . yeah . yeah . m uh yeah , maybe it ' s better if the uh scroll - wheels are um more separate , yeah . like , you have the menu button in between uh yeah . think we have we have now two buttons missing . the uh um the mute button . we have two buttons missing . the mute button . and um , the to to uh have to uh numbers okay . but , uh okay . and on the l_c_d_ , how much it costs ? uh , it costs extra ? yeah . yes . uh uh , yeah , but yeah . if you if we have uh then something standing here , with the l_c_d_ . um , yeah . i can ' t see the . but , uh the easy of uh , th the ease of use wasn ' t uh the most important uh aspect of it . uh , for us it ' s about to sell it . uh one . no . you have more . you have still ten . yeah . what ? okay . okay . see you at the next meeting .","the industrial designer gave a presentation on the interface concept , discussing which buttons will be needed and then looking at some examples of existing remote controls . he suggested using a yellow case with rounded edges and the logo at the bottom , and large , clearly marked buttons . the interface expert informed the group that young people like curved shapes , soft materials and primary colours , and suggested making a hand - shaped remote in plastic and rubber . he talked about the possibility of using a scroll button , and the different chips which could be used . the group discussed using an lcd screen , but did not have enough information about costs to make a decision . the marketing expert talked about new trends , including the trends for spongy materials and fruit and vegetable themed products . the group had a discussion and decided to create two designs , one with an lcd screen and one without , and the interface designer drew them on the board . they put off making a final decision about using an lcd screen , scroll buttons and a menu button until they could find out about costs .",TS3010c
"oops . that ' s as far as it goes . do you also do marketing ? and i ' m christine , and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer . but i ' m not really one . what is the goal of the project ? um no , i i have not begun working on the design , and um i uh i actually didn ' t know we were designing a remote control , i thought we were designing a new monitor . um the website i went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor , and um i understood that that was the project goal . so um i ' m glad i didn ' t d do any work um ahead of time because uh i clearly didn ' t understand the project goal . um i just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and um that ' s about uh that ' s and i i read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . uh for the industrial design ? um well , i would th think that depends on how much money you give us . um because uh , you know , you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models . well , you know um , i kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that ' s very fashionable , that ' s uh very attractive that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own . so it would really would need to um something like the ipod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , so um d uh you know , i don ' t care what it does , just so it looks cool . well , uh i ' ve got a lot of other projects i ' m doing right now um and so i ' ll have to wait and see how those uh how those go . if they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month . if um if i run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . and when would you like that ? uh well if uh if we have enough time uh then d do you think um two weeks is a is close enough ? uh are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? okay , i ' ll get back to you on that . would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ? thank you . uh sure my name is agnes and i ' m an user usability user interface designer . um i was wondering mm - hmm . mm . mm . well , no , not exactly . i mean my job from what i understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it ' s acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . so i think i ' ll have to interact with christine and discuss with her , so that she ' s not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it ' s not going to work , and so it ' s sort of it ' s a loop that feeds in , but i don ' t think necessarily that i ' m in a coordinating position for it . yeah . mm - hmm . which will also feed into the marketing , because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users . so i think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit . um , and then i guess build the plan based on all of that , because i think you need to take all the factors into account . yeah , of course . yeah , we can c_c_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around . sure . no problem . so , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or okay . mm - hmm . okay . mm - hmm . mm - hmm , yeah , that would be useful . sure . okay . thanks . thank you . my name is ed and i do accounting . e_d_ . mm . no . accounting , yes . marketing is uh , is me . well i think that we ' ll see that throughout the day in how we ' re going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . we ' ll have to see on a through discussion on where we ' re gonna go from here and from with this . uh for the moment not yet . good question . no , this is like i said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we ' ll go from there . we ' ll have to simply we ' ll have to work on it together . certainly by the next meeting . i ' m in the sales i ' m supposed to explain them what to do . we have to define exactly what our product is , from uh from what i had in mind we ' re supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ? remote controls , ' cause i had two different things . i had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward i had a discussion about coffee so we ' ll start with the remote control for television then . so we ' re have to design something that is very user friendly . something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , because i think everybody ' s experienced with uh remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth uh throwing out the window . uh th most of them ar i don ' t know we ' re have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , ' cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they ' re building , their designs , their ideas , uh also have to pinpoint which market we ' re gonna go into . it should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the competition , uh th i agree it has to be something it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , i like this . whether it works or not , they have to first say i like this , i like the design , and then it ' s gotta be simple to use . yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for , how much it ' s gonna sell for , that ' s up that ' s up to us to decide , eh ? very good . very good . no . hi guys uh good morning everybody here . and uh i want to introduce myself , uh my name is uh shrida daseri and uh i ' m a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now . so i want to introduce first of all uh the names and the colleagues here . and what you ' re uh drawing ? uh how you spell your name uh ? e_d_ okay . and ? so only accounting ? okay . and ? mm - hmm . industrial designer . so who is uh marketing , nobody in the market it ' s you , okay . so thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , and uh we have a long time , just twenty - five minutes to discuss about uh this project and the the project initiation . first of all i want to ask uh mister ed about your uh marketing plan and your product plan and uh mm - hmm but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or oh for the moment not yet , okay , but uh what ' s what ' s your uh do you have some project plan , something with you or mm - hmm . okay , so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan , okay , a discussion with uh by next meeting , okay that will be great . uh okay , so there ' s any questions or uh first of all about uh this project ? uh the goal of the project i think maybe i ' ll uh hand out to the ed , okay , so to explain uh what is the project because he ' s in the sales and the accounting . yes , so can you explain uh what exactly the product is ? oh i think uh , if i ' m not wrong , we ' re making the remote control . yes . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . and uh what abo uh christine , what about your uh the industrial design plan ? are you have a design already on this product or uh you ' re still working on the design ? mm - hmm . okay . mm - hmm . so uh you ' ll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ? yes . okay . that ' s yeah , but uh before we talk about uh the finance , okay , uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it ' s to the individual also . mm - hmm . okay , but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ? yeah , but uh i need something in the writing , so like uh what ' s your functional design , what ' s your technical design , and uh how many people you need for this project , and what ' s the time frame you ' re looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe uh initial budget you ' re looking , okay , and uh how is going to the market , okay , so you ' ve you ' ve had to meet with the marketing team and how they ' re going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition , okay , so i need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you . okay , and it ' s po b as soon as possible . yes i think uh that would be good , because i need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do , and uh what cost is , okay , and what ' s the time frame and what ' s the project plan , because uh without any uh documentations , i cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , okay , so then it ' s it ' s difficult for me to say , okay , that ' s the reason i need uh some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again . yes , of course , if you need some help , uh so let me know . so , who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , so just let me know so i can uh coordinate all the teams . yes . thank you . okay . and uh ed uh so what ' s what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ? hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yes , so what i uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it . okay , because uh she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , so because you need to sell and you ' re the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow . so , what i prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the christine more and uh within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay , th th that that ' s yes , that ' s you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you uh both of uh the christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . okay , of course it ' s it ' s uh of benefit for everybody individually . okay , so i think it ' s uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she ' s going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . okay , and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know . okay , i can coordinate , or maybe uh , you are my coordinator , am i right ? between uh all the coor yeah . th christine , yeah . which is yes . yeah , so basically you need to interact with christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay , then you will yes . yes . yeah . yeah . yeah . yep . but what i request , okay , keep ed in the loop , okay , in between your uh meeting and christine meeting , because uh he should know what ' s happening . yes . okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so i need to submit to the management . so any questions for uh time being ? yes . okay . to come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with ed , okay , and how it ' s going to be work , and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it ' s going to be work in the market , okay , so then we can discuss about uh further things . so , we ' ll meet when the we ' ll discuss on the further meeting . it ' s okay ? thanks for coming . yes , i will . yes . i ' ll copy , uh le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , okay , share each other , okay , so you know everybody what ' s happening , okay ? and if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email , or uh just come and uh knock my door , okay , so i ' m available here . it ' s good ? okay , thanks for coming and uh i wish you a nice time then . okay , see you later . bye .","the group introduced themselves to each other and discussed their roles in the project . the project manager opened a discussion about the project plan and asked the marketing expert to prepare an overall plan for the project . the marketing expert presented the initial aim of the project : the creation of a fresh , user - friendly remote control device . the project manager asked the industrial designer to create a functional design plan for the device , then asked the marketing expert about ideas for the sales strategy . the marketing expert presented an initial sales plan : to analyze the competition and to pinpoint the target marketing group . the project manager instructed all participants to work together on their respective design plans . the project manager decided that the design plans will be discussed at the next meeting , and that the next step will be to come up with a functional design of the device .",IS1008a
"can try to plug that in there but right . that ' s what we have there . that ' s plastic . plastic covered with rubber . we might uh add some more underneath here . maybe give it , give it a form . i mean you ' re supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , so yeah , you have some rub yeah . exactly , use both . might as well think about th think about the button as well . like either put either one one on either side or not do it at all . it ' s a quick on - off button . that ' s um yeah i think it ' s pretty important . so you don ' t have to fiddle with that . right ? um that ' s not um i ' d say a bit smaller would probably be nice . you wanna play with that over there . there you go . right . . i ' d say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that ' s definitely more beautiful than your average . however the colour , we don ' t have a say in that . that has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . so uh to answer that honestly i would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . ' s nothing you can say about that . i mean i much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . but right . right . it ' s different . you don ' t want your uh three feet huge l_c_d_ dis display in your living room that ' s hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that . yeah . yeah . it ' s very intuitive , i think yeah . s give it a one . right . right . so that ' s a one . something that big and that yellow you just don ' t lose anymore . oops . hmm . well what s mm . oh yeah . you probably mm . y you could add an extra feature actually . which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . we could add that but that ' s nothing we have thought of so far . yes . it ' s it ' s um the it ' s based on this anti anti - theft technology for suitcases and stuff , where you have one piece that ' s attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . that can ' t cost much . so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your t_v_ and the other right . that ' d be tough then . well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . let ' s add one of those features and say yes . two . uh it ' s all just it ' s all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right . yeah not really . right . yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of . it ' s not a one though . one would be the whole thing to fold and stuff . yeah . so that ' s a four at most . y yes . more well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the l_c_d_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , but it definitely is . i ' m impressed . i can ' t do that without a calculator . fifty percent , you ' re kidding . p it ' s too much . um uh battery . two . at four it ' s gonna be too heavy , so that that ' s not our problem . people can change it every month . they won ' t know until after they bought it . . that ' s the advanced chip - on - print , yeah . double curved , yes . plastic . n no . no that ' s just one . it ' s just one mo single mould , we can do that . exactly , right . that ' s not a special colour . it ' s a specially ugly colour , but it ' s not special . s yes unfortunately . we could of course make the buttons wood . say mahogany or so mm - hmm or titanium . uh just yeah that ' s too much . it ' s hard to believe . so we ' ll go for the hand dynamo huh ? i mean let ' s let ' s face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television . you can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . so s yeah let ' s take away the yeah . yeah . right . right . we may not need it . there you go . perfect . okay , the so we can just take away a heck of a lot of the there you go . central ? oh that ' s just yeah . there you go . oops . there you go . one more criteria . fair enough . great . yeah . just half a day , you have a remote . there you go . super super . well that ' s not my fault . that ' s obviously the people i work for uh that work for me , uh they ' ve just you know heads are gonna roll , believe me . yes yes . . pretty impressive . kind of a banana . i do . okay . you guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . um . okay . so first i ' ll just discuss some of the criteria that i found . just based on the past trend reports that i was looking at earlier . and then we ' ll do a group evaluation of the prototype . and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . um so the criteria we ' re gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . so we ' re gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . and one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . with seven being false , we did not achieve that . . okay . so for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? mm . mm . yeah i think the colours detract a little bit . that ' s true . yeah . um okay so , do you think , since we this was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? does that sound good ? what do you think ? three ? four ? five ? four is fair . okay . okay , the second one . did we make it simple for new users ? one , ' kay . okay . um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? i ' d say that so one ? yeah ? okay . okay um the fourth one . how about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? one of the number one complaints . whether you want to or not , you ' re not gonna lose it . okay . that ' s true . mm . annoying alarm or something ? yeah . so . are we adding one of these two features ? gonna say okay . so we ' re back to a one ? or a two ? two , ' kay . okay . are we technologically innovative ? from ipod yeah . but for remotes yeah . two ? three ? but how many remotes do you see like this ? not so many . really ? okay . that ' s gonna hurt us . okay . um spongy material ? ' kay . and lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ? i ' d say we did . ' kay . alright . now we just gotta calculate . six eight twelve sixteen . seventeen divided by s eight . well i haven ' t done math in years . what two i dunno . okay we ' ll say two point four two . right ? how does that look ? it ' s been a while . oh no . they just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically . so that ' s that . oh my god . okay . yeah we ' ll go with that . not too shabby . right . oh . bright yellow . it ' d look really lovely . yeah . leave it blank . perfect . . what ' s the blue part ? oh that ' s the batteries . okay . looks more like a banana . trying to fill in some time there . good teamwork . minus your powerpoint fiasco . no i know . i ' m yeah . incom mm . kinda . we might have a while though . yep . soon as i get this . okay . this is our last meeting . um i ' ll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . uh and then we ' ll have a , the prototype presentation . um then we will um do an evaluation . uh or we ' ll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we ' ll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . um then we ' ll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we ' ll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . um let ' s see , minutes from the last meeting . um we looked at uh the the trends . we had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look - and - feel . it was twice as important as anything else . um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . um and a spongy feel . so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . um looking at other other devices . um the ipod , we really liked the look of that . um we also had uh the kid ' s remote for a simple idea . um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . but i think we ' ve still decided not to go with that . then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . so i ' m going to leave it at that and let you guys take over . the prototype yeah . do you need a this ? okay . very nice . mm - hmm . what but what ' s that button ? uh , ' kay . ' kay . would you like to uh well done . well luckily we are going to find out . or not luckily . um do you have a marketing presentation for us . i think it ' s definitely different than anything else out there . so if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes i would say , i would say most definitely . it ' s bright . it still has your traditional black . yep , not angular . mm . yep . yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form . yeah . i would say four . very non - committal , four . yeah . mm - hmm . s scrolling through and selecting a few . i think that ' s a one . so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could and it is quite bright and uh yeah . but if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit i think . probably two . you know . if we eliminate the fact that you know it ' s impossible to guarantee that it ' s not gonna be lost then i ' d say two . with the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a some sort of proximity pray that you don ' t accidentally lose that piece . okay . two . it ' s but there ' s not a lot of yellow , there ' s not a lotta yellow . course that wasn ' t really we were kinda forced to take that colour . i don ' t know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . if we added the screaming factor then we go up . um i would say we ' re probably at four . we have some spongy , yeah . no . yeah . because it ' s only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back . probably a four at most . possibly even a five . if your fashion is b is carmen miranda , you betcha . it ' s true . seven is two point two point four ? something . and what what is the acceptable criteria ? is there like a scale that we have to hit ? alright then . okay . well , let ' s see . now we get to do the budget numbers . you didn ' t know that you were gonna have a budget . but we do . okay . so i have here an yeah . we want a fifty percent profit on this . oh you can ' t really see that very well . twelve and a half euros is what supposed to cost us . okay , so well let ' s see . the f the wonder if i can make this what the oh it won ' t let me do that . okay . alright so at top , i don ' t know if you guys can read that or not . i can ' t ' cause i don ' t have my glasses on , but so we ' ve got the energy source . there ' s uh four , five , six categories . we have energy source , electronics , case . then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . okay so uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? probably some e either two or four . two ? like it . excellent . this is consumerism . alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip - on - print , regular chip - on - print , advanced chip - on - print , sample sensor , sample speaker . ' kay , we have one of those . ' kay then the case is a probably it ' s double curved . case materials are plastic . um i guess it ' s two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . is that right or is it just one ? maybe it ' s one because of the ' kay . i guess it doesn ' t matter ' cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice . special colour ? interface type . we have pushbutton , scroll - wheel interface , integrated scroll - wheel pushbutton , and an l_c_d_ display . so we actually have the l_c_d_ display and then is it the integrated or is it yeah . ' kay . button supplement ? special colour ? um special form ? special material . or titanium . they cost us all the same . well we only have one button so really we shouldn ' t be charged , we shouldn ' t be charged anything for the the button supplements . um okay . we ' re gonna leave that one blank because we run on a l_c_d_ and scroll . so our total is fifteen point five . which i believe is by three euros over . so the only thing better than um a banana - shaped remote is one that you shake . yeah ' cause the well ' cause we have to have both right ? mm - hmm . so we may not need the l_c_d_ display ? well there we go . twelve point five . okay . so we just remove our screen here . besides look at what the l_c_d_ does to our lovely remote . back to the design room boys . okay so the costs under twelve point five euro . was no . we redesigned it . now it ' s yes . next slide . project evaluation . uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . um so i guess that let ' s see here . i think that perhaps the project evaluation ' s just supposed to be completed by me . but i ' d like to hear your thoughts . uh h what did you think of our project process ? good . yeah i think we st we started off a little little weak . our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . um um but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . um room for creativity ? there was that . um i think we tried a lotta different things and um i think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . um you guys worked together well as a team . and um the means ? which was the whiteboard and the pens . i had some problem with the pen i think , but minus your p well have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired . okay . n new ideas found ? um yes for the remote . maybe no not f for technology . alright . closing . costs are within the budget . project is evaluated . um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . that ' s it . and i still have to do my minutes for the last meeting . actually . um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up . and then we ' ll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . but that ' s the end of our meeting . the prototype discussion . no . there is our remo the banana . um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it ' s basically designed around a banana . um but it would be held in such a fashion , where it is , obviously it wouldn ' t be that floppy ' cause this would be hard plastic . these would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . so that ' s so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . you have to use your imagination a little bit . and this here represents the screen , where you , where you ' d go through . and the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an ipod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . volume up and down . and then to access the more complicated functions you ' d you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . it ' s that that simple . that just represents the infrared uh beam . that ' s a simple on and off switch . um i don ' t know , we could use the voice . t that blue bits should be yellow , d that that ' d be where the batteries would be i suppose . and um that ' s about it . it ' s as simple as you , we could make it really . is there anything you want to add ? yeah . doesn ' t make much make much difference . you could work left - handed or right - handed i suppose . t the actual thing might be smaller . yeah . just the on and off . yeah . it ' s you know it ' s flimsy ' cause it ' s made out of heavy play - doh , but and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything i suppose . with the scroll and the l_c_d_ . yeah . i would . it ' s bright . it ' s it ' s curved . it ' s not there ' s no sharp angles to it . some people might say it . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . i think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had . uh yeah . ' cause we ' ve we ' ve brought it down to basically four controls most common , which are channel and volume . and then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . yeah . yeah . it ' s bright yellow . bright yellow ' s hard to lose . but um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . that , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . that was what we ' d we ' d mentioned . just just to use , to find it when it was lost . but like i said , like i don ' t think you ' d lose something so yellow so easily . and it ' s not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . that ' s gonna be a difficult shape to yeah . maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ? i mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , i mean a million ways . you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you ' ve lost it . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah true . but i mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . they ' re cheap . so it can ' t be that expensive . yeah . yeah . stick it on the t_v_ . yeah . two . i ' d say so . uh don ' t get many mo remote controls with screens on . yeah it ' s stolen technology . but we have . fa ' cause it ' s stolen . no maybe not . yeah as much as as needed , i think . yeah . yeah . yeah . on the yeah . be what we were told , and they ' d say yeah , definitely . . is that some long division ? no . just , i ' m sure there ' s a . no i can ' t do long very impressive . yeah . yeah so . you ' d been going a long time dividing that . it ' s two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . two point four two basically . charge about three hundred quid for it . we ' re advanced chip are we ? yeah yeah . s that ' s yeah . and then i ' d say the integrated . mm . remote control . no that ' s getting a bit tiny . yeah . i ' d ignore that . if it w what if we completely took out the the one single button we ' ve got on . and just had a scroll wheel interface . and the l_c_d_ display . i suppose the l_c_d_ c_ display ' s the one that ' s pushing it up a bit though . yeah . yeah . yeah you could maybe take out the l_c_d_ dis display even , if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the t_v_ itself . uh that is possible yeah . there we go . screen . make it a bigger dial . easier to use . even easier to use then . that was just we ran out of yellow . there you go . even simpler . yeah . for all those fruit lovers out there . yeah . i think we did yeah i think we did quite well . um yeah . right from the start of the day . we sort of knew where we were going straight away i thought . yeah . we ' ve used the whiteboard . technology used . excellent .","the project manager opened the meeting and read the minutes of the previous meeting . the industrial designer and user interface designer presented the prototype they created , which was designed to look like a banana . the marketing expert conducted an evaluation of the prototype . the team found that , although the overall design of the prototype was attractive , its yellow color was ugly . the team rated the prototype highly on its ease of use and felt that its yellow color and shape detracted slightly from its ability to be misplaced and that a feature which causes the remote to make noise based on its proximity to a television needed to be added . the team thought the prototype was fashionable and not technologically innovative or spongy . the project manager led the team in calculating the production costs of the remote and ensuring that they aligned with the project budget . the costs were over budget , so the team opted to exclude the lcd from their design to meet their budget . the team conducted an evaluation of the project process and found that they performed well and were somewhat satisfied by the resources available to them .",ES2016d
"is this okay ? i know . thanks . mm this is very representational fish . um i like them because they ' re sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups , so . do you have a favourite one ? uh yeah . i was just wondering if that ' s the um if fifty percent is normal b yeah . um i would think would be more like sixty percent . but um let me i have two thoughts . one hundred , fifty percent . and and your question is how many do we have to sell ? at twenty five . mm - hmm . yeah , that ' s um so that ' s four million of them ? yeah . and if we make mm - hmm . yeah . four million . hmm . yeah . mm - hmm . y yeah . we could make a hello kitty themed remote . yeah . we could totally go for the japan - a - mation . well i mean there ' s also the cachet that um uh the japanese make great products . electrical their industrial design is very good . yeah . well , that ' s a really good point , because i think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , you know , so if it ' s like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . we don ' t need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down . mm . we can make it smart like an ipod , you know , make everything menus . okay . uh yeah . fine now . oh , it ' s not liking us , it went that - a - way . computer adjusting . oh . uh . okay . so . right . you ready back there ? uh okay . welcome everyone . um this is the kick - off meeting for the day . um we ' re the new group uh to create a new remote control for real reaction . as you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , um become acquainted with each other , um have a little training on tools , uh create a plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . okay . the new remote control is to be original , trendy and user - friendly . that , steph , is your part , is the user - friendliness . the originality um is gonna take all of us . um the trendiness we ' ll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you , sarah . um and we ' ll get on with it . okay , so we ' ll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design . okay ? right . everybody ' s supposed to try out the whiteboard . kate , why don ' t you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , i guess and while you ' re doing that we ' ll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , ' cause we ' re all gonna have to be able to walk around . uh i do not think so , i think it ' s just to try out the whiteboard . ah . uh - huh . okay . great . and the characteristics ? uh - huh . okay . fantastic . since you ' re handy as well , why don ' t you do yours next , steph . i think it ' s to get us used to using the pen . uh no . a mouse - y ? oh . argh . rat . not a mouse , a rat . and your favourite characteristics of that animal . oh . okay . kate ? oh , a fish . oh , okay . fine . favourite characteristics ? ' kay . so they have team elements . i ' m afraid i ' m with steph . and i think your pen ' s running out of whatever . but i ' m afraid i take the coward ' s way out , and the cat ' s looking the other way . he ' s hiding . um cats are sometimes very independent . my parents had cats . uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . okay . now um we have to get down to the nitty - gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um we ' re to sell it for twenty five euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million euros . that tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . um the production is to only cost twelve and a half euros per item . now if they cost twelve and a half , you ' re selling it for twenty five , you ' re making twelve and a half euros each . um and we ' re to make a profit of fifty million , that ' s t uh can you do the maths and how many are we selling ? mark - up ? okay . yes , ' cause our market um is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of you know , you gotta know how many we ' re going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that . to give you a pretty good idea of where you ' re looking . something like that ? okay . that ' s fifty million euros . in order to make fifty million euros , and you ' re only getting twelve and a half each that ' s a lot of selling . two four to be fifty , be four million . you ' d have to sell four million . okay ? right . experience with a remote control . any of you use of remote control for a television or d_v_d_ or something ? you ' re both nodding , all three . well i ' ve seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , but i also have heard about them not working well or not well co - ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another . and they don ' t always talk to each other . don ' t know . okay . are there any um ideas for the remote ? what would it be for and what group would be be for ? we have to think about that one . okay . mm . okay . yeah . um i know this sounds like it was very quick , but the i think that ' s the industrial design is the first one , that ' s kate , for the working design . and user , that ' s you s steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification . i think there ' s going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group , and i think we all , you know , we like our kitty - cat and our rat and our fish , but i think we all have to like each other um to get this done . uh as it says , we ' re gonna get individual instructions , but uh i don ' t think they allowed a lot of extra time , so i think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . do you all agree ? alright . um then i don ' t see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things . alright , so this is the end of the first meeting . thank you all . are we all gonna draw a cat ? that ' s not a mouse - y , no . it ' s a ratty . a ratty . it ' s clothes . that ' s it ' s clothes . it ' s a ratty with a with a with a very long tail . i love whiskers . uh they ' re intelligent and they ' re cheeky and uh fantastic pets and very friendly . and they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you ' re doing your homework . a shark ? it is true that you always sit around you know , you ' re sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there ' s five different remotes , and one for the d_v_d_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . but i presume this is t i presume this is just for television . i think one in b bright colours would be good . i think one that doesn ' t have lots of superfluous functions . like i ' ve got one at home that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , you know , subtitles , mute , there ' s a lotta buttons that i ' ve got no idea what they do , like . mm . ooh , closing the meeting . that was quick . mm - hmm . uh yeah , if i can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on . uh right , so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ? um only animal i could thin i could draw . its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . you can tell it ' s not a bunny rabbit by the ears . um i suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of right , yeah . um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers i think , um because they ' re the easiest to draw . in fact , i ' ll give it some more oh , and the tail yes . um sure it ' s not to test our artistic it ' s a mouse . no it ' s not a mouse . it ' s a wombat . a what ? a webbed foot . webbed f oh right . gosh , why didn ' t i think of fish ? that ' s even easier to draw than cat . that that that ' s the sorta product we ' re talking about , one that will work for a in a home environment , for a t_v_s and i think one that works would be good . mm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . ' kay .",the project manager opened the meeting by stating the agenda and then introduced the upcoming project to the team members . the team members then participated in an exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal and discussed why they liked the particular animal . the project manager briefed the team on the production and selling costs of the remote they are to create . the project manager also briefed the team on the profit aim and discussed how many remotes must be sold in order to reach the profit aim of 50 million euro . the team then discussed their experiences using remote controls and what features in terms of functionality and appearance to consider in making the remote .,ES2013a
"okay . mm . very fun . oh right . okay . mm . okay . sure . we made three for you . um one ' s based on the banana , one ' s based on the tomato and the other one is st look . oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . so . okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . the yellow there is the um the slogan , yeah , that we need to incorporate , it ' s very simple . if you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there ' s some there , um but mainly it ' s speech recognition . yeah . yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . mm i ' m not sure about that . um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want . yeah , sure . um that one is oh no , it ' s delicate . that ' s that ' s already got its stand that one . that ' s it stand . it does also lie flat , but that ' s the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . um the black on the back is the slogan . uh yeah , that well , we did think of that . yeah , if it ' s standing up it ' s it ' s on there , but also we ' re gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . so um and that ' s the um transmit the l_e_d_ thing . these are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . we n were weren ' t sure about putting them there , because um i it ' s it kind of could get bashed . yeah . well , if you hold it , you can you all can hold it , is it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you ' ve got small hands . um , obviously i don ' t think that ' s real sized . it would have to be a bit bigger . okay . um that ' s a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie - talkie as well for speak recognition . um and um then the buttons . yeah kind of self - explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . tried to keep it simple . oh that ' s the charging base prongs at the bottom . we used those . and um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . it ' s not in the traditional place , but um it ' s quite an obvious place . so there we go and and um we have the banana - based one too . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . so are there any um improvements or issues or oh . oh . ooh . mm - hmm . more like a traditional remote control . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . like an s_ shape . okay . okay . okay . mm - hmm . cool . cool . so we could even add something . well maybe we could add something , but maybe if what do you th we ' re trying to save money , so . yeah , if we ' re happy with the design there ' s no point in spending money , if we don ' t have to . but if there is anything you think we ' ve missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . maybe i mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , because it ' s not in an ideal place right now . mm . i think it went quite smoothly . w i think we were very creative . oh right , okay . mm - hmm . excellent leadership . yeah , everyone got enough input , i think . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . okay . well um . mm . yeah , maybe . oh , you got a presentation , sorry . yeah . mm , love to eat that now . kind of a green banana now . it ' s this as well , sorry , we forgot to mention it ' ll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we ' ve got . i ' ve got . yeah . oh could you pass the tomato please . sorry . thank you . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . sorry . sorry , carry on . mm - hmm . okay . um . mm - hmm . um i think yeah , it did . it had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . um so . does it work ? yeah . so . i would say seven . seven is good , yeah , isn ' t it ? i can ' t true or false ? no sorry tr one is true . yeah . okay , so one . yep . mm yellow . uh - huh . uh - huh . okay . is that no is that not trends ? mm - hmm . mm - hmm . uh - huh . but in electronics , i think , it ' s not q always quite so um you don ' t always have so many choices as with chocolates . i think , you know , if you ' re going to buy a t_v_ maybe a company ' ll have that you ' re going to choose from , a company ' ll have two or three choices , but they ' re different designs . we were coming up with one product . no , i mean uh obviously your opinion , i ' m just trying to okay . what are we doing ? adding them up ? oh . okay . okay , yeah . mm - hmm . okay . well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , i would give it um , well , because it ' s hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , so i would actually give it a three . tha three or four , i ' m not sure . three . go for three . that ' s fine . mm . yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . um . yeah , the company strategy , okay . um there was lot of discussing , that was good . um i feel i got my say . um so i ' d give the company strategy a two . okay . is it ?

uh we have budget problems . i ' m afraid you ' re all sacked . oops . i don ' t even have this on . okay , have you got a presentation to make ? no . okay so it ' s just your your show . three ? oh . tomato ? what tomato ? i don ' t recall a tomato . ah i see , okay . mm - hmm . logo . okay , brilliant . okay . okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or yeah . alright , okay . right . that ' s groovy . well i like the feel of it , i like the feel of it . at oh dear . alright , okay . okay , brilliant mm . okay , nice and obvious there , if it ' s standing up , i guess , yeah . oh right , okay , brilliant . like that from its centre . where you ' re , yeah , uh were you ' re holding it kind of mm - hmm . yeah . okay . yeah , okay . yeah , scale model , yeah . mm - hmm . alright , excellent . okay . no . it ' s out of the way as well , i suppose , so . excellent . yep . okay , so so barney the banana . ah excellent , just what we need . lo sort of loch ness banana . cool yeah . well , nice to have uh options at least . ' kay and oh there are issues , oh there are issues . um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . uh , let ' s just enter in the um evaluation criteria . um unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it ' s gonna cost us fourteen point six euros . so we have to rea sorry , i ' ve accidentally highlighted somehow um . there we go . oh god , why is it doing that ? there we go . so basically , um in order to save our two euros um i was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . um . yeah , i mean it ' s already got a kind of cool shape , so but it wouldn ' t have to be curved sort of in and out . and by doing so oh no , hold on . doesn ' t save us quite as much . i don ' t know what ' s going on with this again . oh , good point . um . that ' s sort of curve in and out . no , i think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . okay , i might be wrong though . i don ' t think that counts as a curve , i think that ' s just a shape . a curvature is like the this case . yeah , and why why i ' ve got it two , i don ' t know , i can ' t seem to select any more however . right . no . it ' s meant to be one , yeah , i don ' t know why i put two in there , but um hold on till i find it , i think this shift button might be stuck again . no maybe the shift button ' s stuck in . um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us oh that ' s fine . eleven uh eleven euros sixty . um we cou oh not quite , have the scroll - wheel , unfortunately . what ? yeah . yeah , i know , that just extends it as well . i don ' t know . it one of the buttons is sticking , i don ' t know . no , it ' s ' cause the uh the shift button ' s stuck , or something . no that ' s fine . um we ' ve worked out what it would be anyway . yeah . cancel . piss off . oh well , never mind . um . right , so that ' s finances and i dunno what we what could we reckon we could add ? um well i suppose that ' s our that ' s that ' s our design that we ' ve got . so yeah . yeah yeah . well that ' s that ' s uh okay , so project evaluation . we have under twelve euros fifty . project process , how do we think that went ? are we happy ? okay . evaluation . oh we ' ve been writing this up for m months . uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ? no , i mea i think it means sort of individually . yes , no , maybe ? okay . groovy . so uh we ' re just gonna . uh yeah , okay . teamwork ? leadership , sorry . thank you very much . you ' re all get you ' re all getting a raise . uh teamwork . i thought went well . yeah . uh and well means , yeah . the technical stuff was brilliant . let ' s buy more . uh right . um i don ' t know what , new ideas found , means , to be honest . mm - hmm . mm ' kay . groovy . so just general thumbs up for all of us then . that kind of unfortunately is too quick . uh . i suppose yeah . um . that ' s it , um i think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you . uh let ' s see if i can get this bloody thing to work . whoops . does it go back in , does it ? reusable . i don ' t know what this is but it ' s really really annoying . uh - huh . um i have , yes . huh ? oh right , okay , you ' ve got more , okay . sorry uh . it didn ' t bother to tell me that on this thing . is it ? okay . doesn ' t tell me . oh you ' re doing that . we evaluated ourselves , we thought we were great . mm . o okay , hold on . i wonder w which cell do i want . okay , i didn ' t realise you had that bit . okay . okay . alright , okay . the board working again , is it ? uh . yeah . when the user requirement is essentially just to operate the t_v_ , so yeah , of course we haven ' t actually got a working model yet . one , yeah . no it ' s it ' s like true is one end , and false is the oth oh , i ' ll go for a one . basic requirements but of the pro of the project . yeah th come on that was the tha ' kay . being fruitist . he ' s a tough cookie . six . five or six . oh i see . yeah , i am sort of pret uh just the fruit does me in , i mean uh it might it might be trendy to some , but i ' m just not swallowing the fruit , so um uh also uh i would have liked to have seen the l_c_d_ screen in it . um so yeah i ' d say about four as well . yeah , yeah . um yeah , a three . pretty much kept to the company strategy , so i would go for a a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by cool , groovy . cool . brilliant . in which case we are done . ' cause we ' ve evaluated and we are within budget . champagne lunch anyone ? hmm . e excuse me i forgot my copy . no , not mine yet . yeah . uh can i have oh sorry s mm - hmm . mm . and double curve on both sides ? curve . yeah , this is double - curve , no ? this is double - curve . it this one is single curve . ' cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides . so double - curve . like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . hmm . hmm . maybe . mm . should uh you can do one thing . you just select one box outsi yeah , this box . then move it with the help of this okay . just uh just uh okay , just a minute . okay . no input , like this . shift . no it ' s not . yeah , it ' s not working . should we ask meli should we ask our technical expert melissa ? yeah . yeah , we yeah . yeah , these are new ideas , like glow - in - the - dark or something like that . we discussed all the new ideas , but of course we couldn ' t reach any proper goals , we couldn ' t use these , but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . these are new ideas we and new shapes , everything . at le yeah . hmm . hmm . so so uh brian , have you have you finished ? uh mine needs also this . at last mine is also the presentation . yeah , yeah . s uh is the project evaluated , that is mine . yeah . so . yeah . so . so now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . how we are going to means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not . how mu what rating we will give to these products . so of course this is will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . so what methodology i will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . we will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ? means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . so this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . then marketing strategy of the company . as we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s yeah . so but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . so now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . i ' m having this scale this scale , so we have to do it on a board . the user requirem i think . thank you . so . so these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . first of all uh comes user requirement . so we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . i i will first i would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? s so what do you think you will personally give . seven . uh . uh one is means highest ranking , okay . but i think highest ranking is seven , or one ? okay , right right . so it ' s one for from your point of view . and what do you say our industrial expert ? uh d you can you can tell on on the like i think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i interface expert . but you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? two . and what about uh you , brian ? you will go for one . okay . uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology - wise , price - wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , and uh yeah , lower end . and the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . but if a person doesn ' t like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . no , don ' t buy our product , because we are l we like this only . so we are showing our preference for particular fruits , two or three kinds rather , and yeah . so . uh no , uh personally as a marketing expert i don ' t believe that , because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . so you can what shape a person will like . so in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . and by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . uh maybe . okay but i will i will personally won ' t give it beyond three . so we can yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . three or four ? uh , no sorry , it should be no sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing . yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , and that ' s i have taken it very wrongly . yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev yeah one pe exactly . so we can say one or two . because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two . yeah . so where were the trends . sorry ? yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something . uh . okay . yeah . uh okay . uh personally i wi uh i think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them . so and in this way our product is good . and the second thing , now people don ' t want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . so that is also ef that also our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . and yes . it is cus spongy also . so they can play with it , it ' s quite good . so then i think , maybe i can give it two . so four five ten thirteen thirteen . so we can is it fine ? so what about company strategy ? okay . so what about you , brian ? yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers ' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . so since our product meets all these requirements , so i would also prefer to give it rank one . so four six six half . so we can say two or one okay . so th seven seven . uh overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two . yeah . so i think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . so we can launch it . yeah . so yeah . great . okay , almost there . yeah , yeah . okay . yeah , there ' s good news ? oh . oh . cutbacks . hmm . okay . oh . um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see . yeah . okay . mm . oh yeah , yeah . this one is uh , i suppose for the younger audiences . a a more friendly type of right , right . it ' s to uh induce more television watching i suppose or yeah . say it for the camera . right , right . yep . it won ' t stand . just let it lie down , it wont stand . what ' s on the uh on the left ? okay . w why is the uh double curved two of them ? is i mm . ' cause that ' s the uh the biggest expense there , right . got two of them okay . well we can work around that um cut things out . but you think it should be one . okay . yeah . yeah , so we ' re we should fire the accountants . fire the accountants . ah yeah , we could add things . maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you ' re starting from , and then use the arrow keys . does that work ? no mm . is it the other shift button maybe ? did you try both shift buttons ? it could be the other side . that ' s too bad . oh . yeah i think we have a a winning product . great leadership . yeah , yeah . these pens are are neat though . okay . uh so let ' s talk about our bonuses and the raises we ' re getting for this , right . right , right . uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay . something we should get . oh ok uh . anybody clay covered banana . blue . it ' s fun to touch . do we have the uh the marker for the board ? there it is . no that ' s false . uh . it ' s hard to know . i i give it a two . okay . um yeah , i think i it might even exceed it um . but i guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons . um i ' m gonna give it a two . two . what are we doing ? we ' re gonna average them ? okay . so seven fourths . about one point f one point eight . okay . yeah round it up to two . so trends . can you explain what you want us to write there ? how it how conforms to the current trends ? ' kay . as far as the uh technology it its ' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it ' s missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push - buttons , or the scroll - buttons , um but it doesn ' t have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . so i give it a a four . i ' d give it a kinda middle of the road for for technology . yeah . well it was yellow . well , i think it ' s the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . is that the question ? um . yeah . i ' ll go with two . so one and a half . a two . yep . s okay . uh .","the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototypes to the group . two prototypes featured different fruit shapes , with one including speech recognition instead of a large number of buttons . it also featured scroll wheels for channel control . the other prototype was designed like a banana with children users in mind . the project manager announced to the group that with all of their desired features , the project would go over the alotted budget ; after a reanalysis of the features of the prototype , the project came in under the budget instead . it was decided that another feature could possibly be added . the group evaluated their effectiveness as a team and felt that all members worked well together and could be creative , and that the project had very good leadership . the marketing expert led an evaluation of the prototype according to the initial project goals ; the evaluation showed that most of the goals had been sufficiently satisfied in order to launch the product .",ES2005d
"hi . hi everyone . i haven ' t . mm - hmm . yes . so who who has what ? actually maybe um uh - huh . what do you have , mirek ? uh - huh . and i have a uh well just a a piece of paper with some suggestions . what about you , denis ? uh - huh . should we start with the two presentations maybe ? yeah ? mm - hmm . no , i haven ' t seen it . um . mm - hmm . so w what what is this s the second image on the slide ? is it the the poster or has a s it has a strange format , um horizontal and uh so it ' s one two three four five six . mm - hmm . so it means restricted . uh - huh . yeah , because your table is only the nineties , yeah . mm - hmm . well w w no , no , actually if you look at your tables , i think it ' s a sort of uh well average between number of votes and and and uh yeah the the rating or th the marks , because there are in you table you have uh things that have very few votes but still are ranked quite high , for instance number twenty four , which has only four thousand votes but um yeah . yeah . maybe it ' s just the search is compensated a bit for the number of people , i i don ' t know actually . because if you have just ten votes and yeah probably are not in the database . but yeah , anyway it has excellent votes . haven ' t seen it , but mm - hmm . oh . yep . mm - hmm . the last sentence from the movie or oh . w mm - hmm . mm - hmm . so these guys were actually nominated , so the the bottom part of your slide , actually , it says yeah , so these are the best awards they had . okay . too bad . well there is just one winner , so . uh - huh . okay . yeah , i think your table is very clear denis . no , i haven ' t . yeah . w what is the name in french , ' cause uh - huh . uh yeah . yeah . well , actually your third slide has the plot , so uh . yeah . oh yeah , exactly , yeah . so yeah , this guy is jailed , okay , uh - huh . wow . okay . yeah . yeah , i haven ' t seen i heard about it , but mm - hmm . yep . yeah . um i think there was a celebration of uh sixty years from the liberation of the camps , actually . because they were liberated beginning forty five and uh yeah , it ' s not bad , and it ' s also i think it ' s a good idea at at least from my point of view it ' s coherent with the previous films , like history , im major events . i don ' t know if we want to keep this coherence , or change radically , but maybe yeah , that ' s yeah , i think it ' s a drawback uh . well , of the seventeen eighties . yeah . maybe it ' s representative of a style of the eighties , i don ' t know . as for amadeus , but uh that ' s i don ' t know . but yeah , hard to tell . mm - hmm . yeah , it ' s funny actually um because on your on your slides actually the ratings are eight point seven for both . no they have the same , usual suspects and pulp fiction , both are at eight point seven , but on denis ' s table uh this one is at eight point six . who knows , maybe people voted for it , yeah . could have changed in the meanwhile . though with one hundred and thousand votes , it shouldn ' t change too much . i mean , given the number of votes , i wonder but anyway , it ' s m it may change i think , yeah . okay . wow . that ' s encouraging . no . haven ' t . uh i i ' ve seen very few movies from the list , about ten out of the first fifty . okay , yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah , i ' ve seen it , this one . i i like it very much . i ' ve actually seen it well , it ' s plenty of well known songs and , you know , the twist thing and oh i would keep it as a candidate , but i don ' t know , i think for the moment m m guess most of these are candidates , so we ' ll try to . yeah , we should probably vote after everyone yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . no . i you you recognise them , or you can read the the text on the images . oh okay . huh . very well . mm - hmm . yeah . mm . okay . no , yeah , so probably not uh so who is in prison , actually . yeah . no no . he tries to decrypt the the the other killers ' behaviour . yeah . well , not very nasty ones . or does he , i don ' t know . yeah . yeah , that ' s basically the point , yeah . mm - hmm . so on the picture you can see uh jodie foster and uh ha ha . th th the moth . anthony hopkins . the other one , i don ' t remember . we don ' t see any h see him very often . but it ' s mm - hmm . yeah . but the plot is quite horrible . i mean the not the plot , but the what the the active killer wants to do is quite horrible and mm . okay . yeah , i ' ve seen it . i think i ' ve seen it a second time on t_v_ , but maybe not entirely . they ' re much too young . indeed . i haven ' t seen it , but i would like to see it , so . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . so it ' s not very violent , really . ah okay , great . mm - hmm . okay , yeah . uh - huh . and what about the well that picture with the the girl and do you see naked people in the movie or is it about sex or something like that ? ah okay . supposedly . okay . uh - huh . okay . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah , i think it ' s a mixture of bringing new things to them , but also making them enjoy the show , so that they come to our movie club , so yeah , i think we shouldn ' t maybe do very mainstream movies , but well okay , the list here is quite uh yeah . yeah , i think also if you look at the number of votes here . uh yeah . uh regarding the denis ' s table i would say given that this site , i don ' t know if it ' s mainly american , but uh i would say that yeah , i think mm yeah , it ' s english speaking anyway , so uh though so yeah , but if you look at yeah , but i would say mainstream are the ones that have more than , whatever , sixty thousand votes , and you can see some more , well , confidential films that have like ten thousand , twenty thousand , like mm princess mononoke , twenty thousand and uh , whatever , the the kieslowski at eleven thousand , the trois coleurs rouge . yeah , it ' s not bad at all , yeah . so yeah , anyway , if you want a definition of mainstream or whatever . mm - hmm . yep . d uh danish i think , it ' s the dogma movement . yeah . yeah . yeah , let ' s uh yeah , so it ' s uh actually i have made i have made photocopies . i have them denis , so it ' s all for you . actually i i tried to propose just one movie with some alternates . uh you want one ? um so my proposal , which is only a proposal , would be to to keep the focus on um uh more or less history and action , so lawrence of arabia was , okay , about this guy during the first world war , so it happens , okay , outside europe and the states , but uh it ' s a piece of history . uh apocalypse now it ' s uh vietnam , if i ' m um correct and , okay , amadeus , that ' s much uh much earlier and it ' s not about it ' s not violent , which is a nice thing i think . but um given that we would like a movie from the nineties , i thought the saving private ryan oh thanks for projecting the document um would keep this more or less this theme of uh history and war and action drama , while showing actually a very new and i would say humanistic view on on war . because it ' s it ' s not like the sort of glorification of uh , you know , the good guys that that uh well go against the nazis , but uh it ' s uh it ' s well the plot actually if you don ' t know it it ' s about people looking for just one soldier , in fact it ' s um it ' s about a a family of four brothers , who actually three of them get killed during the war in these days of forty well , i guess summer forty four and the uh well the government decides that they need to get back the fourth brother just to save one member of the family . and this this guy is private ryan . so the movie is not about killing the germans or whatever , it ' s about saving at least one guy from a family , so but of course the the setting is during the war and um it ' s very realistic and uh very dramatic in fact . it ' s um it ' s not at all a glorification of war but it ' s just uh it shows a bit uh the violence of um of the things . and especially the the beginning is uh i think it ' s great , it ' s it ' s very violent , but it ' s it ' s an image of of war . it ' s uh yeah , but i think if mm well if you compare it with it yeah , it ' s the landing , and actually every more or less everyone gets killed and oh i i didn ' t know , but yeah , actually it ' s very well filmed and it ' s very realistic , and i don ' t know if you compare with , i don ' t know , in lawrence of arabia i think they have some battles and camels . i know it ' s very nice , someone falls somewhere there and , well you know , it ' s like battles that look nice , but this one doesn ' t look nice , and i think it ' s uh it ' s also maybe representative of the nineties , you know , people starting to get the more uh realistic view of uh of of war . but it ' s true , it ' s it ' s a bit violent , and so what i put here it ' s a bit long too , it ' s nearly three hours . but uh i don ' t know , apocalypse now is quite long too i think i don ' t remember . mm - hmm . yeah . so it won uh five oscar prizes , uh best director for steven spielberg , um best cimena cinematography , etcetera . uh i don ' t know . oh . hmm . mm - hmm . um okay , so um yeah , that ' s that ' s the point , it ' s it ' s a bit grey , and actually if you look at my second page , uh in the trivia i found out that in fact they uh actually reduced the the colour saturation of the movie , just to make it look maybe a bit like the documentaries from the time . yeah , i was very surprised to find this uh it ' s they they turned back the colours for uh yeah . yeah . so this uh fact number two i think obviously for i mean technical people like us is uh is is is quite funny . so yeah , so i i mean these four points could serve also as an introduction if you want to talk f fo for fi five or ten minutes before the movie , i don ' t know , in in the room . so uh yeah , mm so tha this would be my candidate , but i ' m very much open to mm - hmm . yeah , on th on yeah , on the picture actually yeah , it ' s tom hanks . in fact you you don ' t see uh private ryan until the end more or less , or you see mm because they they ' re looking for him , yeah . mm - hmm . no , tom tom yeah . well the caption says captain john miller , so . so i if you look at the caption um yep . so he ' s uh he ' s yeah , so the private is just a simple soldier actually . yeah . uh who , private ryan or no no , they find him actually and they send him back to the family , but the captain dies actually , tom han l oh yeah , it ' s private ryan , yeah , remembering at the beginning . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah , exactly , yeah , he dies unfortunately . so yeah , there is sacrifices and mm - hmm . oh . mm - hmm . yeah , the german . uh - huh . yeah . well i mean yeah , it has a moral dimension all over the movie , you know , saving the individual and the guys . so yeah , i i don ' t know . i don ' t know how many people have have seen it , well among you , well most of you actually . oh all , okay , all of us . so maybe th people know it quite well . yeah . okay , so yeah , so i have some other candidates , um it ' s on first page at the bottom . uh i also put pulp fiction , uh the silence of the lambs and i also , well , sort of included la vita e bella , but i know we ' re an engish movie club , so i guess it ' s um it ' s a bit out of purpose . but it oh it ' s uh it ' s about again about the camps and the second world war . so it ' s about uh a family of italians which uh g arrives into a a death camp , and in fact it ' s treated in a more or less humorous mode , so um the father tries to hide from i from his boy that they are in a death camp , and it ' s this very strange mm well , not really humour , but relation between the uh how well the boy gets saved , but the father dies . yeah . so i don ' t know i it created some controversies i think , because people said you shouldn ' t do any form of humour related to the camps , but it ' s very very moving , so i think it ' s anyway um italian , so . yep . yeah . okay uh denis . haven ' t seen it , but uh i heard it ' s very funny . and i ' ve seen some other films by by the coen brothers . yeah , which is in your table . um the last one was the one with catherine zeta - jones uh . crue crue yeah , something about cruelty or very funny . a movie or a novel ? no , but they say that raymond chandler wrote the novel . you see , it ' s the the last but one paragraph on your second page . i think so . mm . um y you wrote the paragraph on the poster ? okay . could be edited a bit . yeah . yeah , there are two lebowskis in the film . mm - hmm . yeah , there should be a reference there . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . it ' s probably a bit dark for a poster , but otherwise it ' s very nice . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . oh okay , it ' s a dream . okay , sounds a bit crazy . yeah . hmm . uh - huh . yeah . i like it because it ' s not so dark , so the images are a bit um brighter . yeah , yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . mm - hmm . wh what about a brighter background , because this one , i don ' t know how it would show on a wall or something like this . it doesn ' t really catch your attention . ' kay . yeah . mm . yeah . okay . yeah . no , the content was very good in the second one . th yeah , all this information is very good . mm - hmm . oh or just one of them . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . oh yeah . w i i would suggest if it ' s not too long , maybe each of us could nominate one or two movies . we make a list and then we vote . what do you think ? so who wants so , mirek , what do you nominate ? you are ? okay . in the nominees , okay . another nominee ? okay , agnes , usual suspects . mm - hmm . yeah . well you can nominate one or two , so that we or whatever . um i would nominate , well okay , my candidate , saving private ryan . and uh i ' m happy with your nominations too . uh i would nominate also pulp fiction , because it ' s a very good movie . um denis , so your yours is already nominated , but you want yeah . okay , so it ' s already on the list . mm - hmm . yeah , if you want . so so we have uh seven candidates . um if you have a good short term memory that should be okay . yeah . so uh big lebowski , usual suspects , saving private ryan , pulp fiction , american beauty , schindler ' s list and silence of the lambs . so now let ' s vote . should we vote just for one film or should each of us say give okay . so big lebowski alright . uh you can write on your paper maybe . and saving private ryan . so yeah , pulp fiction , yeah . okay , so each of us chooses one to eliminate . okay . denis ? okay . i will just remove it this way . um um i would remove schindler ' s list because it ' s too sad . well , it ' s not very good reason , but oh , too bad . no , no . well i mean leave someth okay , so we ' re left with the big lebowski , usual suspects , saving private ryan and american beauty . okay , so let ' s vote just simply for one , for the moment . so i would vote for american beauty , because i haven ' t seen it . um so mirek , big lebowski . agnes , denis ? uh yeah , you can choose . y you ' re the president maybe after all uh . okay . yeah , i think i ' m quite fine . is it a b yeah , i think at least it ' s funny and uh that ' s nice . okay . so . decision . mm - hmm . that ' s your fault , mirek . no , no , no , i mean yeah , it ' s you voted for it . but i ' m quite happy with it , i haven ' t seen it . well , beginning of may i guess , to choose the film for may . is that yeah , the fifth is um ascension . what ' s that , going up to the sky ? yeah , we can do it like the tuesday before the ascensions and that ' s may third . so yeah . so thanks for the posters actually , denis , they are very nice . okay . see you on what , april twenty sixth , or what ' s the mm twenty ninth . okay . hello . no , i haven ' t . thank you . mm - hmm . okay , i have a powerpoint presentation and uh it ' s about there are some reviews of the of the i think like seven movies . no , i haven ' t . hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm mm - hmm mm - hmm . nineties , yeah . so plenty of awards we we could say . of all the movies , yeah yeah . it ' s still good , actually . by the users . so it ' s definitely just the average of the rating and okay th the number of the votes is there just for the information , so that you know how how reliable yeah . yes . mm okay . okay , then you yeah . then yes , yes , yes , yes , sure . mm - hmm . yeah . mm - hmm mm - hmm . and what is the second movie ? yeah , sixth sen mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . okay , now you can go to to my slides , but actually what i pre what i have prepared is just a kind of a review of fo uh se six or seven movies , if you ca can go to the second slide . yes , basically seven movies , and it ' s uh it ' s uh uh top movies uh based on the uh on the ra ranking and a and awards awards . um you see the the names of the movies on the on the on the wall . so um we can perhaps go through all of them and we can little bit discuss , so i i i have n i didn ' t see all of them actually , so it ' s just we should probably select one of these , because i think uh these are really good movies and uh , okay , we will see . so if you can go through uh okay , so this is the first movie and uh it ' s it ' s m it ' s more like a drama . uh it ' s uh it ' s uh very uh high ranked and actually you have a a nicer list , because uh we can even see the number of the votes . so what is the number of the people ? finally i found actually your table much better than my than my presentation , because perhaps here we can we can really see i mean what is the ranking ? we ha didn ' t have the plot , yeah . yeah , who has seen this movie ? because then perhaps someone can give some some comment . mm - hmm . yeah , it ' s this one . it ' s the one that is on the on the wall . it ' s projected , yeah . so i ge okay , so no one of us saw this movie , so in that case perhaps it ' s it ' s little bit danger to select that movie for the for the s play , so uh schindler ' s list , who saw this ? i saw it , and i think this on is re um this one is really nice , it ' s uh , you know , all a all of you knows the the story , so . uh it ' s quite hi it ' s quite high ranked , so i think uh it ' s not a bad movie , i ' m uh thinking whether there was some good occasion , uh something what has happened recently . there was something like a celebration of the fifty years after the war or something recently , no ? no , that ' s sixty , yeah . s it can ' t be fifty , sure . yeah , so . mm - hmm . that ' s true . yes . yes yes yes . um but even here i wouldn ' t uh uh say that the that th this style is representative of the nineties , right , so . um okay , but uh anyway , i think it ' s it ' s really a good movie , i like it when i saw it and uh okay . it ' s one of the candidates , i defini yeah , steven spielberg is really quite a good so i director , so i i would say we we could think about it . so i would keep it as a candidate , at least . that ' s the second one . um no . i think we can just skip this slide . uh yeah . it ' s that ' s strange , what is the rating ? perhaps it has changed . it ' s higher . it gets updated . yes , yes , and i did it i did it on wednesday . yes . mm - hmm . so it probably has changed , so um it becomes more popular , no po uh yeah , yeah , yeah . uh schindler ' s list . i saw it , i saw it . mm - hmm . okay , pulp fiction . uh i think it ' s again quite uh hi high ranked uh , but from my perspective , everyone already saw it . who was interested in that movie , he saw it . wh who is not interested in that movie , he he didn ' t see it and he uh wouldn ' t uh like to see it in the in our movie club . so i think we should uh we should just leave skip it out and leave it out . i i wouldn ' t think about this as a candidate , even if it ' s a good movie , but i don ' t know , i think it ' s yes , yes , there was ple i i think there was a plenty of loops actually , plenty of . i fully agree that you can see this movie three times perhaps , three times and for the fourth time see you still discover something new , but uh on the other hand , i have the impression it ' s really it ' s uh , you know , every everyone saw it , it ' s it ' s quite well known , uh it woul it wou i yeah . me neither . mm . so what do you think ? i i wouldn ' t think about this as a candidate , because it seems to me it ' s mm - hmm . vote , that ' s the best , yeah , yeah . when going through we c we could just eliminate . okay , so we are not gonna eliminate this one . uh goodfellas , i didn ' t see it . no . but you can read the comment from the users , uh that ' s the that ' s the last uh bullet point , and it says uh simply a masterpiece uh , and it ' s uh scorsese ' s last really great movie to date . mafia , yes . i can ' t recognise them from the picture . the picture is not very good quality . and it ' s a movie from nineties ? the one that you saw , that you mentioned ? yeah . no . silence of the lambs uh should i tell something more ? godfather of all thrillers , that ' s what it what it says on the what some uh user says . uh so , okay , it ' s a little bit horror , so i think it ' s quite it ' s uh it ' s uh it ' s definitely not for kids , uh but uh if the kids are not visitors of our cinema , why not ? it one have to rethink when when when you are watching this movie , you have to think and it ' s uh scaring . uh why not ? mm - hmm mm - hmm . so the f_b_i_ agent is assigned to to help uh find a a missing woman and uh save her f uh her from a psychopathic killer with the help of another killer . yeah . he ' s in prison , yes . he ' s a really psychotic man . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . anthony no . but he plays it really good . anthony hop hopkins he really plays it very good , very good , yeah . so i ' ve i ' ve see i ' ve seen it , but i can ' t really remember exactly the all the details . uh . it ' s a long time ago , it ' s from ninety one ? ninety one , yeah . so and i saw it when i was like twelve or thirteen . so perhaps it would be yeah . could you go to the next slide ? yeah , it ' s here , and that ' s actually my last slide . so um i don ' t know , because it nicely f i i was thinking perhaps we are not able to go through more of them . uh so american beauty , so i can perhaps read a little bit the user comment if you want , or uh yeah , you can read the plot outline on the on the on the projector , but it ' s basically deep , wonderful and penetrating movie , extraordinary uh irony and the p and the psychological drama about american life . poetic ? okay , the way of filming perhaps , but uh mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . and it ' s my last slide . so uh yes , yes , yes . and i think , okay , why not . it seems to me that perhaps that schindler okay , definitely schindler schindler ' s list is perhaps more serious topic for sure , but um well it depends , it depends what we want . do we want that people are more like uh relaxed in our in our cinema , or are more interested in some particular things ? um what do you think , i mean what should we how we should uh what should be the influence , how we are influencing the people in the cinema ? um what do we want ? mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . hmm . mm - hmm . maybe can i ask you for the for the list of movies ? this one . and the denis , denis , could you give me the the list of the to uh top fifty ? yeah . but you have your own copy then ? okay , good , thank you . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . that ' s the i i i saw it and i d i ' m trying to remember the beginning , that ' s the normandy landing ? okay , yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah , that was really horrible . yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm mm - hmm . no , not at all . mm - hmm . because people start to complain that uh that w there was a problem with a t_v_ when they were broadcasting the movie on the t_v_ . uh that ' s an interesting point , interesting point . yeah , but in the end you can ref yes . no . mm - hmm . by the way , did he fied dinally uh f fi died finally or not ? uh the private ryan , yeah . th they i remember i remember they found him , but ah okay , yes yes yes . because i remember mm - hmm . because i remember that th in the end of the movie they are trying to defend some bridge or something and there ' s quite heavy shooting and uh finally it ' s actually john miller who die . okay okay . it ' s not the private ryan mm - hmm . perhaps it was a g uh this uh tom hanks , yeah . oh yeah , yeah . if he would kill him , he wouldn ' t die . wow . tom hanks wouldn ' t die . i ' ve seen it . i ' ve seen it . out of time ? mm - hmm . what is the movie about , the la vita e bella ? ah - ha . mm - hmm . uh - huh . uh - huh uh - huh . how it end up , what is the what is the ending of the movie ? mm - hmm mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . that ' s actually the third movie about the second war . schindler ' s list , a p uh saving private ryan and la vita e bella . mm - hmm . just partially i think . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . why the movie is called the big lebowski ? why the big uh lebowski is his uh family name , right , but why it ' s called the big okay . and why the big lebowski ? it ' s the it ' s the second one or uh - huh . ah okay , okay . uh - huh . mm - hmm mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . i think this is not bad , because they say something little bit about our uh movie club and uh , yeah , the big lebowski it ' s clear that it ' s a movie and uh i guess the people can remember that it was a movie at least , even if they haven ' t see it . cd cover . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah , but i on the contrary i would say there is too many colours and uh it ' s difficult to read and uh yeah , that would be the best . yeah , all this information and put into the first one . mm - hmm . if if they fit there if they fit there , you will see . mm - hmm . so big lebowski . mm - hmm . okay , good idea . so i ' m really convinced by the big lebowski . i yes , yeah , i i would like to uh , yeah , at least to have it uh in the in the nominees , exactly and uh i ' m trying to remember all of them . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . and then i ' m still hesitating between the schindler ' s list and the s uh silence of the lambs . may i nominate uh these all these three movies , big lebowski , schindler ' s list and the silence of the lambs ? mm - hmm . so eliminate first eliminate first ? mm - hmm . i ' m sorry , could you go t uh uh uh once again through uh the list of the movies , because i don ' t or i is it possible to put them on the on the on the uh whiteboard ? okay , okay , so the schindler ' s list , the usual suspects , uh silence of the lambs , uh big lebowski , okay . saving private ryan . one , two . pulp fiction , okay . i have six i have six . how many ? okay , we american beauty . okay . yeah , and i would eliminate yeah . and i would eliminate pulp fiction actually as well if so another one . because it because it would be saving private ryan . mm . i vote for big lebowski . make a decision . already ready yeah . so so it ' s gonna to be big lebowski ? okay . no no no no no , i i like it , i like it . okay , beginning of may , but there are there is plenty of holidays at the beginning of may , no ? ascension ? mm - hmm . okay , okay , no problem . good . twenty nine . really looking forward . i want to see it . hi . so i don ' t know if you all received the the a agenda for this meeting . do you no ? here it is . so um um the goal for today are um we have two goals . uh first is to decide a movie for uh the next projection for our movie club . as you know uh so it ' s for the last friday of this month of april . as you probably remember , the movie already projected were uh lawrence of arabia and apocalypse now in february and amadeus from milos forman in march . so um the question that is open is are we going to select a movie from the nineties and which movie . so that ' s the first goal , decide for a movie to be projected , and second goal is to uh discuss for an ad advertising poster um for our um uh club , because we noticed that n last time not enough people came to the projection . so that ' s it . um wh who wants to start to so i guess you all prepared some documents for the mm selection of movie . okay . okay . yeah , i have also uh a piece of paper with uh my favourite movie . okay , so presentation ? yeah . okay . a agnes , we can start with you ? okay , here it is . i passed this one . which which one was it again ? the guy who was controlling ? i don ' t remember , i have seen the movie twice , but uh it ' s the bald guy , the no , no . okay . yeah , it ' s a bit more commercial that one . first one . um r_ is what uh in okay . restricted . but wait , i i have the top ten from the nineties ? no , the top fifty . and it ' s fourth . oh , sorry , sorry , yep . yeah , yeah . from yeah . yeah , yeah . but but sixteenth in top two hundred fifty , it ' s what two uh all all days ? all time ? okay . but those rating are more like uh it ' s the number of votes , no ? votes and u yep . and rating . yep . yeah yeah . yep . okay , yep . ah , now i remember . yep . actually there is one guy who is the at the police station and they ask him to tell the story . yeah . yeah . both movies are quite similar in some way , because the last sentence is uh totally contradictory to the whole movie . it ' s uh yeah , the last sentence from the movie . yeah . okay . you have a last slide or no . okay . okay . yeah one hundred f w uh one hundred forty thousand . no , we don ' t have the plot of the of the movie and uh okay , but maybe we can wh who has seen this movie ? i uh i think i i i ' ve seen it actually , but i have no idea . it it ' s in uh jail right , it taking yeah . i don ' t remember well this movie . yep . okay . okay . okay , so mm yep , so let ' s yeah , i ' ve seen it also . sixty . s sixty years . yep . yep . that ' s right , yeah . but then it ' s not representative of the nineties . it ' s more a movie about the story of uh the horror of the uh endured by the jewish during the second world war . yeah , right . yeah , yeah . okay , and steven steven spielberg is uh okay . okay , the usual suspect , do we want to say something again about it , or how come it ' s coming third on your list ? it ' s forth on agnes ' s uh and on my list , but it ' s okay . ah you j you selected some movies , no ? you didn ' t take the six first . and me on tuesday , probably . okay . do we have something to add on this movie , or okay . yep . yep . that ' s why you are in the movie club , to see more movies . why not ? it ' s quite representative of the nineties , i think . and the structure of the movie is interesting . i i think the the first scene is actually the same scene as the last scene , no ? there is a kind of loop in this movie . yep . yeah yeah . i agree also . yeah . you ' ve you ' ve seen it ? okay . and the soundtrack is uh is gorgeous also . no , you don ' t the soundtrack . no . yeah , yeah . w w we vote at the end , or you want to okay . no . ah it ' s scorsese ' s it ' s uh yeah , again a movie about uh on mafia , no ? with uh robert de niro , and who are the o two other guys ? i cannot ah joe pesci , yeah . on the r on the right , you mean ? yeah . it ' s the exact same actors who played in um another mafia movie that i cannot rememb les affranchis , it was the name in french . no ? about uh mafia uh it that ' s why i tha that ' s why i didn ' t go to see this one , it ' s quite i it seems to me they ' re all about the same subject and the same i don ' t know . probably . yeah . okay , n nobody ' s seen it , so . okay . so it ' s about a psychopathic killer . and what was it again , the plot ? i mea the he he ' s in jail and he ' s still killing ? ah , okay , yeah , yeah . yep . who ' s playing the ps psychopath again ? i don ' t yeah . okay , yeah . okay . no , i ' ve seen it actually twice , i think . that ' s it ' s it ' s probably begin ninety one . yep . okay , american beauty w w was coming next , seven , was quite quite nice actually . ah , it ' s actually there . why you choose you choose seven movie ? okay . yeah , it ' s definitely about american life . it ' s it ' s kind of crude the critique , but uh on the other way it ' s quite poetic , it ' s uh yeah . yeah , you know , with the the way of filming and um i don ' t know , i found it pretty no , it ' s q it ' s quite in interesting . so yeah . well , it depends . ah no , it ' s it ' s not violent at all , but more it ' s more the cr the cr the critique that is quite crude , because all the people in this movie are are uh psychopath in their own way . but they are normal people then . yeah . actually , there is this it ' s uh uh what , a fifty years old man that quit his job and fall in love with um the best friend of his daughter . yeah , it ' s it ' s good movie . okay . you have seen it , mirek ? i think we w want them to to see movies that they won ' t see oth otherwise , but i ' m not sure then it ' s quite popular the movie we selected , so . if they are in the top fifty , they are quite mainstream , but uh uh i think there is the there are chinese movies , english movies . it ' s it ' s quite a lot for kieslowski actually . i was surprised to s yeah yeah . and festen also is uh is quite high . uh i i don ' t know if you ' ve seen this one . it ' s the celebration i think . it ' s uh uh movie from a swedish guy . danish ? dogma movies , yeah . lars von trier . yeah . okay , can we discuss about your document , maybe ? yep . okay . okay . yeah , sure . yep . yeah . it ' s quite horrible actually . yeah . mirek , you didn ' t see it ? yeah . but it ' s it ' s a piece of art because he used something like one hundred camera to film that , or yep . yeah it ' s quite s yeah . yeah , it is . there is two there are two versions i think , and but w but we yeah , we projected the longer one , so . how many times uh spielberg received the best uh director oscar ? not for the schin schindler ' s list or for for e_t_ ? he won f he won the mm no , he won f for e_t_ , he won the mm cannes , uh what is uh palme d ' or . yeah . that was very interesting to read , yeah . but then they uh i read that they they w where was it ? th they turned back to yeah . and then then there is this uh there is an hero , i mean it ' s uh or a non - hero , and in all the other stu stories , the in the previous movies there were an he an hero , lawrence of arabia , uh amadeus . apocalypse now , it ' s also non - hero i think , but uh but here i don ' t remember it ' s actually the tom hanks the hero , or it ' s he ' s private ryan , tom hanks ? no he ' s not . he ' s trying to find him . yeah , yeah . okay . at the end , to tell you the truth , i didn ' t like so much the movie because it was quite moralistic , because there were a guy who was who didn ' t kill german because he was quite non - violent . and because he didn ' t kill this german , the german killed , i don ' t know , uh maybe um yep . and it was like , if he had killed the mm because he e yeah . yeah . i have . yeah . yeah , we ' re running um but it was in english , no ? yep , so i have uh a quite different movie to propose you . i don ' t know uh it ' s f called the big lebowski from um uh joel coen . actually they are brothers , you probably know them . i don ' t know how many of you have seen this movie . no ? yeah , they made uh fargo , which is in the list . and uh uh cr uh cruel intentions , or something like that i think , or okay so , i don ' t know how i ' m going to sell you this movie , because actually the plot is impossible to make , because it ' s um actually it ' s inspired from a movie called the big sleep and um uh it ' s actually the t where i ' ve seen that ? in a it ' s uh a movie from raymond chandler , the big sleep . it ' s uh ah okay . yeah yeah yeah . so it ' s it ' s uh it ' s a novel , okay . but uh then the story goes that while that film was in production and director , okay , okay you ' re right , it was a book . okay , so it ' s about a a g a guy who called the d the dude , i don ' t know you pronounce it , and uh he ' s actually uh smoking pot and doing nothing , just um he ' s living in l_a_ . it ' s uh it ' s a typical typical fellow from the from the suburb , and he has some friends , uh typical friends , one one is uh an old guy from coming back from vietnam , obsessed by vietnam , um another guy who is never speaking , and they all play together uh bowling . and um the casting is very interesting , there is um okay , actually i wanted to propose you some posters related to this movie . uh maybe it w maybe it ' s going to open the discussion on on posters as well . so actually here you on this the first poster you can see the actors from the movie , i don ' t know if you know some of them , so jeff bridges at the top , uh goodman is the second one , the b the big guy . then turturro , and uh uh the last one is buscemi , and i don ' t remember the name of the girl . yeah , julianne moore . uh i i took it from i don ' t know where . so uh actu actually i ' m not going to sp to describe much more the big lebowski , but uh it ' s quite hard to describe , it ' s uh it ' s it ' s a journey about this guy , but it ' s it ' s a movie , quite surrealistic , i mean there are some part that are like coming from dreams and uh yeah , it ' s his family name and uh actually jeffrey lebowski and he ' s he ' s the there is a a story with another lebowski that yeah . and uh i i i don ' t remember , maybe it ' s just uh uh because of the big sleep there is uh i don ' t know , a reference . so it ' s a kind of it ' s like american beauty in some way , it ' s even worse . we see worse people . so it ' s kind of uh an ethnographic movie i would say , but uh and it ' s a modern hero , it ' s it ' s quite fun . and the casting is is marvellous , so that is that ' s it for this movie . and um i just wanted to go to the design of the poster actually . because yeah . yep . the idea is is also to discuss the content . shall we put a summary of the movie or the plot , and w what kind of information do we want ? so that ' s the first poster . there is alo um this poster , quite dark also . uh so y y i don ' t know if you you cannot really see , but uh mm there is the the pricing information . so we said that one movie is eight francs and three movies eighteen francs . and we can have annual subscrip subscription of sixty francs . uh i wanted to say some information to involve people on in the committee as well , if they want to take part to the committee to select movies . and uh what else ? s some yeah , actually the idea was to s yeah , there is at the bottom the a scene from one of these dream of the big lebowski . and uh the the first part is actually y you see a cowboy and the the hero , the jeffrey lebowski , the dude . and the cowboy , it ' s actually at the beginning of the movie , the c the cowboy introduce the story , and he ' s coming back at the end of the story , and he ' s e explaining what kind of movie uh you are going to to see . and last posters so same principle , but i w i don ' t know , i w i was thinking of adding some some um cita quotations of uh well known directors . and uh yeah . okay . okay . okay , i see . and yeah . okay , i see what i wanted is more or less to know the content of the movie , uh what y you want to have on the poster . because we di we okay , on that one . okay . okay , great . so i think now we have to decide for a movie . and um yep . so yep . i th i would nominate uh american beauty as well . and um and i would be okay with saving private ryan , it ' s it ' s it can or we can eliminate first one one movie each , and then we s and then we select . okay . okay . yeah . that ' s a bit cruel , but uh that ' s i think a good way . me , i would remove silence of the lambs because i think it ' s too violent . and you have a reason for it or okay . maybe you can eliminate another one , you can no ? w agnes , you v o okay , now i have the if we want okay , if we want to take a okay . okay , so i ' ll go with the big lebowski , since the posters are already ready . yeah , i think . okay . so we have other anyway . so can we decide for uh a next meeting maybe ? okay . okay , o or we ' ll decide after the projection of the movie the date . it ' s okay . okay okay . you ' re welcome . okay . thank you . and uh see you at the projection ? no , twenty ninth . okay . hello . yeah . yep . um i ' ve got a powerpoint presentation . sure . it ' s not very long in any case . yep . yeah . okay , so what i was thinking is basically the previous movies that we had , which you ' ve already mentioned in the agenda d um lawrence of arabia , apocalypse now and amadeus , were fairly historical , serious , dramatic , and also action - ey movies except for maybe amadeus . um this month i was thinking of selecting something that ' s more in the present time , still dramatic but slightly less serious . and what i ' d propose is something of a thriller or mystery . and i know that a lot of people find mystery is not really mysterious in the movies these days , they kind of can predict what ' s gonna happen , um but in the nineties there were some movies that did have surprise endings and that people came out saying okay , didn ' t see that coming , so i thought we could maybe show one of those . and even if people have already seen the movie , a lot of the times you go back and watch the movie again , and you pick up on things that you didn ' t really notice the first time around , or you see where the clues were and mm what led up to the end , so that ' s more along the lines of what i was thinking . and the two in particular that i would propose are , next slide please , the usual suspects and the sixth sense . um i don ' t know if you ' ve seen any of them . uh the usual suspects was directed by bryan singer and written by christopher mcquarrie . it has a fairly large cast , so i ' m not gonna read all of them , but the main characters are kevin spacey and gabriel byrne . and it ' s basically about five criminals who get set up . um they ' re arrested , they ' re released from prison and the get together um and plan a crime , and basically the story is told through the views of one of the suspects . um the tag line is kind of neat , five criminals , one lineup , no coincidence and you get told the story um as uh that these f characters are being controlled um by one sort of uber - villain , and in the end you find who the uber - villain was . and i kind of like the the quote from rolling stone magazine , the usual suspects is the freshest , funniest well they ha have you guys seen the movie ? so i ' m not gonna give away you want me to give away the movie ? that ' ll spoil it . i ' ll tell you later . but the the quote from rolling stone is fairly accurate , i think . it ' s one of the freshest , funniest and scariest crime thrillers to come along since pulp fiction . and the other movie is the sixth sense with the famous line i see dead people , which the little boy says . um it was written and directed by m_ night uh shyamalan and stars bruce willis , haley joel osment and toni collette and again has a neat twist that you find out right at the end . yeah . yeah , the sixth sense was very commercial , but anyways it ' s the poster for the sixth sense , but unfortunately i couldn ' t find a clear , big enough one . yeah . yeah , i th i think it ' s only part of a full yeah , it goes th the all of the se all of the senses . um if you go to the next slide there ' s slightly more detailed things about the movies . so the usual suspects is a hundred and five minutes long , so it ' s a decent length of time . it has an r_ rating , so i don ' t remember what type of audience we had at the last uh shows , but it may not necessarily be suitable for kids . r_ is sort of if you ' re eighteen and under , you have to have an adult with you . it ' s mostly for violence , yeah , it ' s restricted . um it got an eight point seven out of ten on the internet movie database . it ' s the sixteenth in the top f two hundred and fifty movies and fourth in the top movies of the nineties . it won um a couple of academy awards , notably for best writing , um so that ' s for the script um and best actor for kevin spacey . mm - hmm . yeah , fourth in the top movies of the nineties . sixteenth in the top two hundred and fifty i think , of all time . yeah . so it won lots of awards um , it won best film from the british um british film association , or the british equivalent of the academy awards . um it was nominated for best foreign film for the cesar . plenty of awards , yeah . i think of all time , yeah . yeah . so yeah . yeah , it ' s ratings by viewers and yeah , like memories yeah , and forty four as well , which has seven hundred and forty something votes . yeah so yeah um yeah . no it ' s a good movie , i i highly recommend it , and i wouldn ' t mind seeing it again , because i do know the ending and i haven ' t been able to watch it again to see where the hints were that were scattered across the movie , ' cause apparently there are hints as to who it is . yeah . okay . yeah . and he ' s the one telling the story , yeah . there ' s him and the the guy in the burn unit . the second movie is the sixth sense . again , it ' s fairly short . it has an easier rating , it ' s p_g_ thirteen , um it ' s much less violent . it got an eight point one out of ten , it ' s a hundred and first in the top two hundred and fifty and it ' s nineteenth on your list i think , if i ' m not mistaken . yeah , it ' s nineteenth . um got a fair number of votes , too , ninety six thousand . um again , it was nominated for a lot of different academy awards , um it didn ' t win any , but it got a lot of buzz and a lot of people liked it , so . those are my two selections , and as you can see , the plot is a boy who communicates with spirits that don ' t know when they ' re dead , seeks the help of a disheartened child psychologist to figure out why he ' s seeing what he ' s seeing and what it means . yeah . yeah . yeah . it ' s only right right at the end where you find out really what ' s going on and it makes you rethink everything that happened beforehand . so those would be my two suggestions and y they ar they are slightly more commercial , or at leas the sixth sense is , than the other ones we ' ve seen , but yeah . yeah , they were they were nominated for a lot of different awards , they didn ' t win . but i guess the comp i can ' t remember what the competition was that year , but and they were nominated for a lot of them , and um yeah . so i think that ' s it , unless you have any questions . yeah , that ' s it . you sent your slides around , right ? yeah . no i haven ' t . i ' ve heard a lot of good things about it , i ' ve heard it ' s a really powerful movie , but i haven ' t seen it . yeah , it ' s set in a jail . yeah . me . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . it ' s a fairly emotional movie though . that ' s one thing to keep in mind is that it ' s yeah , but amadeus isn ' t really representative of the eighties either . yeah , and according to your thing it ' s nineteen eighty four , so . no . it is a good movie , yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . but it gets updated daily . yeah . mm . no . wait , how many of us saw schindler ' s list ? three of us ? did you see it ? i ' m just trying to keep track of how many of us have seen you have ? you have . you haven ' t . i can ' t remember . i think also it ' s old enough that even if people saw it the first time around , they don ' t necessarily remember everything that happened , ' cause i remember seeing it when it came out , but i don ' t particularly remember so we ' ve all seen it . is what ? i haven ' t i don ' t remember the soundtrack . yeah , i mean if there ' s something that none of us like , we can just eliminate it , but we might as well leave everything ' till the end . no . yeah . yeah , it ' s a gangster movie . ray liotta and joe pesci i think , maybe ? i think yeah , on the right , and the guy on the left is ray liotta . i recognise them . i ' m a movie buff , i know way too much about movies and actors and everything . what was it about ? very descriptive . no . a little bit ? okay . yeah . mm - hmm . so the other killer is hannibal lecter , who yeah , he ' s in jail and he ' s real no , h he tries to help the f_b_i_ agent , but he plays head games with the f_b_i_ agent at the same time . and so with her ? he manages to freak her out . so . hannibal lecter is a very the moth . which , the one who ' s in jail or the one who anthony hopkins . i don ' t either . yeah , he ' s scary in that movie . yeah , i vaguely remember what it is , but how many of us have seen it ? i ' m guessing you haven ' t seen it or h okay . so have we all seen it ? okay , so we ' ve all seen it . i can ' t either , ' cause i saw it right when it came out . it came out when ninety one , yeah . so . yeah , me too . and at that age i was like mm . yeah . that was very good , yeah . yeah . yeah . suburban life . there ' s a lot of very true things in it . yeah . yeah . it ' s much less dark than the other movies we have on that list . it ' s not well it ' s dark but no . no . but not like violent cutting people to pieces psychopaths they ' re just everyone has their own issues and no . well with hi his daughter , his like teenage daughter . so that ' s the best friend , and he fantasises about her and mm - hmm . see i don ' t know what was mainstream in europe , like all of these movies are very mainstream for me . but it has other movies , but i think it ' s predominantly no , there ' s movies from everywhere , but mm - hmm . yeah . no , i ' ve never even heard of it . oh okay . thank you . mm - hmm . it ' s v very very violent . the landing , yeah . yeah . this is not a movie for kids , like yeah . yeah . yeah , the redux version is longer . yeah . i think just once for this . oh maybe he did . no , for e_t_ he didn ' t . it wasn ' t until he started doing things like schindler ' s list and saving private ryan that he actually started winning awards for them . did he ? oh okay , yeah . i didn ' t know that . they re - enhanced the colour , yeah . that it was their t_v_s and not mm - hmm . yeah . yeah , about two thirds of the way through the movie , ' cause most of the movie is them find trying to find him on the front , right ? no , no . yeah , he ' s trying to find him . private ryan was matt damon i think , yeah . yeah . yeah . is it him at the begin it ' s him at the beginning of the movie at the at the the graveyard , right ? yeah , with his family . yeah . i have . i don ' t think so . no , it was an italian . mm - hmm . yeah . no . mm - hmm . mm it ' s julianne moore , isn ' t it ? yeah . mm - hmm . hmm . i quite like that . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . looks like a c_d_ cover . yeah . mm - hmm . oh okay . i actually don ' t like it . it looks like two yeah . it ' s it looks like two separate posters . although i think you can mix i would keep the format of the first one , add the quotes and the content information from the second one . so take those take those quotes , get rid of that section of text , put those quotes in there , put the the information you had in the second poster about the movie club , how to join , kind of in the middle and keep this title and everything just slightly higher up . i think it does . i think the contrast between the the the strip of film and or the strip of pictures and everything else is yeah . yeah , so take all of that content throw it up into the first one , and then maybe add the quotes that you had from the from the famous directors sort of at the bottom or something . yeah . usual suspects . mainly because only two of us have seen it and it ' s not a mainstream movie , so i don ' t think a lot of people would have seen it to begin with . mm - hmm . so you reduced that by what , two ? american beauty and wait i ' m missing one . what am i missing , pulp fiction ? was that one of them ? okay . i have seven . okay . pulp fiction . i ' m not a huge fan of quentin tarantino . and it didn ' t make a good impression . really eliminate pulp fiction . it ' s gone . we ' re all gonna vote for something different . i i still like the usual suspects , but i like american beauty too . so . usual suspects . you have the deciding vote . yeah . that ' s fine . it ' ll make a good change from the other ones . if you don ' t like it it ' s your problem . yeah . yeah . ascension . mm ' kay . okay . ninth , ninth ? yeah , twenty ninth .","the project manager opened the meeting and stated that the goal for the current meeting was to select a movie to screen .

"so so so . maybe . maybe maybe maybe . bra mm that ' s oh that ' s oh i like it . i mean you guys gave me more than i was asking for , so i ' m happy because we ' ve got some really marketable features in this . yeah i think it ' s good . good good good job . uh pla i ' m ha it ' s great . that ' s great . it ' s a great feature . so you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he ' ll be across town uh , i can see that . yep i like . good job . no no . well i mean of course , i mean my my s my suggestion is we ' re gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . you know some blend of silvers and blacks . so you ' re not gonna find my uh my folder up there i gotta do mine up at the board . yeah yeah . so no it ' s not in there because i had the computer problem and i i i cou i couldn ' t create it . i couldn ' t create it in the powerpoint , and i think i ' ve got this really strange cable . so what i had , basically going from the powerpoint format , is that uh yeah yeah i like this a lot . is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ? so what we had is we had the method . that ' s not how you spell method , is it ? no a_ . . so this doesn ' t go so fast this way . and when i speak about method i speak about the marketing of the product huh . and uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market . we ' ve got the features , we have the uh characteristics , and we have the i i don ' t know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the corp corporate help me . the the corporation stands behind the product , okay . so the features i think we got the scroll , we ' ve got the uh the locator , we ' ve got the durability , we ' ve got the dependability , we ' ve got you know the features that make this a unique product . um the characteristics i talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . uh and the corporation , we ' re talking about we ' re we ' re a new we ' re a new company . we ' re wanting to make a name for ourself . we ' re wanting you to uh find our product so we ' re gonna give you a good product at a fair price . one thing i would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? that was something i would be interested in . um so yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , i believe , to make it marketable i believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty euros . we ' re gonna be competitive , and we ' re gonna we ' re gonna have a market niche . um w that that would be uh that would be i think a decision best made by corporate um i i m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , i th i think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . but i ' m sh i ' m sure open to to market this in either direction . but you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost i think it uh there ' s nobody else that ' s putting this this combination of of ingredients together . the only limitations i see to this is that we ' re focused on television only . uh that ' s the only that ' s the only drawback i see to this . but with all of these other features i think people c one thing i ' m i ' m hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . there ' s gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn ' t work for my d_v_d_ and my but i like these other things , so they keep it , they don ' t take it back . well one of one of the thoughts that i had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? you know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . you know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after mm - hmm , but you follow what i ' m s i ' m s yeah ' cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we ' re yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that ' s that was just an idea i had . uh to me the only additions yeah . yep . but anyway that ' s uh mm - hmm . we ' ve got a we ' ve got a curve and a droop . i don ' t know whether that . ooh . no , i think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . yeah well we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , we raised the price of it , we ' ve added two t new technology to it . so you know you know if this thing flies then we ' ve we ' ve adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us . yeah yeah yeah yeah . but i like i mean when i say we have we had i believe we have room for creativity ' cause w this is we did it . cohesive yeah . yes synergistic yeah . yeah . you know you know what they ' re gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th new ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or what are we ta oh . well i i mean clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but i ' m sure that there ' s there ' s some justification for these things that i don ' t know about . and of course i did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . it ' s not been uh it ' s not been cooperating so well , but i don ' t think that ' s the that ' s avoidable . no . okay . so we need to close this meeting , yeah bravo . congratulations . s i ' ve got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let ' s close this and come back and ' kay . put on your mic . boss . yep . alright . three , three . pedro can have it . i like i ' ll help talk . unit price . scrolling through your favourites list . it ' s very prominent . so here i ' ll give you the so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , um and then the volume controls are here and here . uh you ' ve got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . this is the power button . uh we have our um we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here ? this is the teletext . the programme button , yeah the programme button . so this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . so um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . so you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it ' s pretty hard to actually damage it um yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it yeah . yeah and it depends on if it ' s sliding , but i think it ' s pretty ergonomic . you can feel it . yeah of course . well this is clay . yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , but i think we might scale down the final model a bit . these this is a bit larger than it would be , but mm pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . beep beep beep . um beep beep beep so beep beep beep beep beep beep be shut up . beep beep beep okay . um no no no tha that ' s alri exactly that ' s exactly what those are for . and um there ' s one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , is um you could beep beep beep we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger it it ' s it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn ' t figure out what button is important enough to put there . and we we don ' t wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so mm . right . so maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , but mm - hmm . oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time . so we ' ll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . careful . beep beep beep . yeah . no way . beep beep beep . mm - hmm . well , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units . oh . uh - huh . uh - huh . yeah . oh , sorry . yeah um i do think we that we we uh don ' t need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , so there may have been a m miscalculation in there . and we and we have a single - curved uh uh i think that it ' s single - curved , yeah . see it ' s a little bit more than f single - curved . so yeah it ' s fifteen point eight , that ' s where we came up with it . okay . yeah we do . ah . what do you know . oh it ' s a that ' s not very special , it ' s pretty if th . that ' s a scroll . uh no we just use it as a scroll . it was a pretty accurate estimate i would say . yeah . s ' s kind of s frighteningly accurate . what ? i think we did pretty well . sh i think there was plenty of room . we got a couple innovative i couple innovative ideas . mm - hmm . yep . there was a lot of synergy . these cables suck . yep . yeah . lapel . that ' s our boss . pedro ' s right . pedro ' s right . oh wel well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature . all right . good job guys . so you forgot how this works again ? boss . hmm you knocked it up ? thi third third third . the end product thingy . yeah . . um yeah so what we ended up with . production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight euros , someone forgot the units there yeah , uh unit price unit production price cost thing . um we implemented the basic functions , which is just t_v_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . yeah . zapping you know zapping . maybe it ' s just a portuguese thing . and um yeah that was the result . start s the the start uh to to to programme yeah . not helping . don ' t have no one to handle that . yeah . so you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where ' s my remote . the locator function . wicked isn ' t it ? ja . nah . it fell off . w we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but we we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . but uh very co very colf colourful . beep beep beep . yeah . we don ' t it ' s a scroll . yes . we ' re wicked . awesome . yeah . yeah . that was mm - hmm yeah . no . yeah . basically . it was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was teamwork . yeah . and that ' s d you must have very long shirts . that ' s way far down lapel mic . lapel lapel lapel . that ' s almost a crotch mi cr oh dear oh dear . ' cause this is you were using it o upside down . still that use them like that . bunch of new ideas . yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . mm . coulda been worse . mm n no . hooray . free coke provided at the cafeteria . who wrote that one ? cool . uh ' kay . so yep . okay so we ' re here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ' kay ? and here ' s the agenda for this meeting . uh i ' m just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that i can see some demonstrations of over there . looks cool . and then we ' re gonna evaluate it . then we ' re gonna talk about finance , and i ' ve got a lovely excel spreadsheet that i knocked up in the last five minutes for this . and uh yep . and we ' re gonna evaluate the product and close . got forty minutes to do this in . we should be fine . let ' s try and keep this one on schedule . so your thing is in where is it ? is it in who wants it ? zapping your favourite channels , eh ? oh okay okay . ah ' kay okay , that ' s favourites . ah ' kay . i like the the the the logo on there as well . it is very prominent . so this is the okay . ah , okay i see . it ' s pretty cool . is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? oh well i guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it . mm . feels good . i take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . yeah it ' s kinda cool . you have to reach a little bit don ' t you . ah yeah that wouldn ' t make sense . it ' s cool . i ' m impressed . and hold it so wh what ' s the marketing perspective ? okay . mm it ' s impressing . so let me get it , if i press this button i see . that ' s pretty cool . hang on . i plan to do that as well . so the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in ? ah okay okay . yeah it ' s the right shape isn ' t it ? but maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , ' cause then it would need to be hit on both sides . okay . but it ' s definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , hasn ' t it ? so is that the the final colour scheme as well or ? okay . the hmm . it came off . the scroll wheels , a problem with them not being sort of i don ' t think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore . mm . okay enough of that . well i it ' s cool guys . ' kay so are we done with the this presentation ? okay . now now . have you ? okay . can i not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? oh i see i see . do you would you a argue that that we ' re better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? mm - hmm . mm ' kay . and we ' re actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren ' t we ? th there ' s no fundamentally different technology to do that . hmm . yeah , the plus there ' s the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less b because at the moment it ' s actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it ' s very simple , and it just works . mm there ' s a risk of that . okay so we can talk about finance now . so i have a little spreadsheet for us where i i was wondering , you when you talked about the fifteen point eight euros , i was wondering how you came up with that figure ? okay so i have bit of a spreadsheet here for this . now i ' ve made a f few assumptions here in that i ' m assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four euros , equivalent to solar cells , which i think is probably fair considering that we have in - house manufacturing of power adaptors already . uh and i ' m assuming that the locator beacon , the you know the can be made for it sounded different that time uh can be made for a similar price to uh an l_c_ display , uh an uh uh do you think that ' s fair coming from a m the manufacturing ? . okay . yep . okay . so we ' re down to sixteen point four , yeah . is that a single - curved rather than a double - curved ? we ' re not entirely sure what single - curve versus double - cur you think ? okay i ' m convinced . but we save one euro that way , yeah ? so we come bring it down to fifteen point four . well hang on . do don ' t speak so it ' s in here , in that w do we have any we have special form don ' t we ? so that ' s yeah . but the the the we haven ' t talked about any special colour though uh i don ' t th if we ' re going for greys and silvers then i don ' t think we ' re o okay so we ' re push - button , scroll wheel , we ' re basically we have uh th is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? just a scroll ? it ' s not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ? okay then we have fifteen point eight euros . it wasn ' t bad . okay so we ' re on to the we ' re on to the pat - on - the - back part of the presentation , where we have a look at the criterias th that paul the criterion criteria that paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell how ' s it going ? anyone got any thoughts ? how how have we done today ? i think we did pretty well too . that looks pretty spectacular . any other chang uh thoughts ? okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? is it the . i i think we we ended up being quite creative there . mm . not every idea necessarily , it ' s still a remote control . uh no yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit i guess , but the uh ' kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? no th th i think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . i agree . synergy . teamwork , yeah he is uh . what did we think of the meeting room , i guess is an important thing here . mm . yeah , this falls off and uh the white board worked really well without any pro mm - mm , lapel . wha okay , oh , alright . that ' s it ' s down , it ' s quite close . keep it , keep it calm . oh dear . no more pizza for me . so yeah the the pen came in alright and it ' s a little uncomfortable to use but i guess it works . nah , i ' m i ' m not convinced of that at all . i ' ve been wor i ' ve been wondering about that all day , but see these look like they ' re that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside - down . i don ' t care . uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . what new ideas have we found ? well let ' s do both then . uh for the product ? yeah we came up with quite a bit . and for the meeting room , has anyone got any more yeah less sore on the ears . okay so are the costs within the budget ? nope . oh hang on it really that ' s something we that the costs were under twelve fifty euros . no requirements are changed . we ' re still under twenty euros to build , so we ' re good . and the costs within the budget ? not the original budget , but they are now . is the project evaluated ? mm i think so yeah , then celebration as it says . oh i don ' t know how that got there . uh anyway . thank thanks guys . yeah , i ' ve got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too . oh .","the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented the prototype to the group and displayed all of its components . they demonstrated how the locator function operates . they suggested that a trigger button should be included in a later designing phase to improve the feel of the product . the marketing expert gave an evaluation of the product and felt that it satisfied his criteria . he suggested including a lifetime guarantee and expressed concern that the remote would only be used for televisions . the project manager discussed the final production cost with the group ; after an analysis of all of the components the final cost was 15 . 8 euros . the project manager then led a discussion about the group ' s experience on the project . the group felt that they worked well together and that they had room to be creative , but only after they changed many of the initial specifications . they also had difficulties using the meeting - room equipment . they were satisfied with the increased final cost and budget .",IS1002d
"yes . alright . well . yeah , well you see , each made one , we didn ' t have enough yellow dough . this is the one that i made . it is uh curved , easy to hold , hand - held , nice and small with big easy buttons . this is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus . of course we need someone who ' s experienced with the television . i mean this is the infrared thing that ' s gonna zap at the television . uh i ' m not quite sure how to make that , but i ' m sure it will work . uh this is on off switch , ' cause i think we do need that , and i think it gives it a nice balance . and it ' s gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . um as for what it ' s actually made of well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right in the different menus . uh position , i presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . the main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . right ? form curved , kind of smooth , hand - held , makes it feel nice to hold . uh material , i think kate ' s gonna tackle that quite a bit , but i think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it ' s just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . also with on off switch and infrared uh i had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . so like uh well , i dunno , what ' s it like ? i guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . whereas otherwise we ' d thought , like with this one or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . so we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . and what we well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . uh material yeah , that ' s what i have to say about material . can i scroll down on there and see what else well colour , i think i definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that ' s the company colours , but if anybody ' s got any other suggestions , i ' m quite willing to consider them as well . so , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if i ' m yeah , maybe , kate , you better say what you think about them . i thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , i guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . this one has n banana , yeah . this one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it ' s round and molded , it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy - feely , kiddie , it ' s more like yeah , you ' d expect it to be like a child ' s sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which i quite like that sort of image . ' cause it ' s very big and chunky and child - friendly and hold them , you see , you know . curvature , is it to your liking ? if you don ' t wanna tire out your thumbs after all . yeah . breaking , oh right . well you see , that ' s why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it ' d just be rigid . yeah , we really like we really like that design , i mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . like a c like a compass point , you know , just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . and it ' s like the the ipod scroll wheel , but better . yeah . yeah , yeah , i mean it that ' s what it makes me think of , mobile phones , i was try i was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? it ' s texting . hmm . yeah . i mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of i mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , but we do definitely think that it ' s a viable option . uh yeah , we ' re finished . yeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? price of materials . not that we actually know anything about it , but we can we can pretend . it depends what what you mean by fancy really , ' cause when i think of fancy , i think of it ' s got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness and which i ' d call these quite uh minimalist , simple and plain , but i mean i do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , so in that respect it is quite fancy . i think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , i ' d say maybe aesthetic . like stylish or aesthetic . fancy . did you just break the pen ? well d we ' ll just call it fancy then . yeah , i think we n we need to they ' re both yellow with black buttons , it ' s just that we didn ' t have any more dough to represent uh that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . so what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isn ' t that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn ' t actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , so . so that ' s maybe not something we have to decide just right now , is it . just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two . yes . oh yes . well , maybe only a two or a three then , ' cause it ' s no we still haven ' t decided about specific sponginess or specific yeah , i don ' t really think that ' s gonna work , but no . no . well it is quite it is quite quirky i think . it could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . oh , we also need tho think about the energy . is it the kinetic energy ? if it ' s it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . yeah , but we haven ' t completely developed that side of it yet , so we ' re not completely sure about that , but yeah . yeah . i would say maybe a two , ' cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . i mean it ' s not just like i mean it ' s not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res i mean means something different , whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you ' re in . uh we need somebody to develop that . yeah . just putting no excess buttons . as for see if we ' re technologically innovative , i ' d say it is quite innovative , because there aren ' t really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . i mean i know we ' re not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . well , just kinetic then , . it ' s the wind - up . what does double curved mean , i don ' t understand . oh no , we don ' t need that . no . single - curved , i ' d say . i i just wanna say plastic . it ' s just button . yeah . yeah . well yeah , like the compass point one . yeah , they could be plastic . great . yes . yeah . and play - doh . yeah well , ' cause i mean it ' s so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . so much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . yeah . spongy . and i ' d never heard of the kinetic energy before , so . good work as a design team , because we oh yes . yes . yeah . and the the only false one is because we ' ve chosen to keep a simple old technology , which if it works perfectly well i see no point in improving on if it works , so . yeah . so we do count as i think excellent or one . . bring on the ice sculptures . yeah . that ' s what i said , ice sculptures . is that the end of the meeting ? red . agenda three . mm . i like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . it ' s really kind of a mm - hmm mm - hmm . yeah . but it ' s also like texting , you don ' t yeah . it ' s also in terms of um being lost it ' s it ' s quite it looks quite different . you know , i i d i have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to you know , this is really identifiable . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . no , okay . um shall i take your uh power ? oh . okay . this is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . so , this means we ' re going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . so i ' m going to go and use the whiteboard , and i ' ve made a list of criteria to look at , and so i ' m gonna i ' m gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it ' s going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and i ' m gonna now use the um the board . okay . so um fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . and in fact i hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , like they overlap . mm , yeah , price . we ' ll put price up at the top . um okay , so did you say ? uh okay , so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? mm - hmm . mm - hmm . i yeah , so in that respect i think we ' ll go with that respect . yeah . elegant . yeah , no these aren ' t the exact terms that the um yeah . elegant . we ' re gon let ' s use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is yeah . n that um yeah uh the uh is fancy . so let ' s let ' s take it to the next level . well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy . we ' ll call it e_f_ um , do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ? should we go with the yellow in terms of i think that ' s a really superior they ' re both yeah . yeah . yeah . as a banana . i think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we ' ll call it the banana . and of the two i really like i m i like the banana , but i i do like the chunk . no , but i mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them . unless do you guys wanna evaluate both ? okay . so we say true . um technologically innovative . yeah . so we ' ll say we ' ll say uh false . easy to use . one , is that inappropriate ? okay . oh , pardon me . um trendy , s and i say specifically spongy fruity . okay . okay , so two ? um are there excess buttons ? that is false . um good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . true . ugly . people don ' t respond well to ugly . sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people like oh , yeah . yeah , i do too . oh yeah . and i was i was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it ' s cost saving ? with the yeah , with the energy . it is going to be kinetic ? yeah , we ' ll c we ' ll say it ' s a cost saving enviro . uh so yes . well you ' re still in the play - doh stage . anything else ? including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ? okay . so true one or should i go to two or three ? okay . um other ? anything else you guys can thing of ? and i ' m gonna actually change a couple of these so then i ' m gonna instead of ugly i ' m gonna say it ' s attractive and then make that true , so that ' cause i have to do an average . and then um excess buttons . exactly . wow we ' re doing really well . yeah , be you know , so it doesn ' t ruin the polarity . mm - hmm . or l_c_d_ . yeah . well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think i should change the innovative or add other features . if not i ' ll average those . okay . mm . so um okay , how about if i uh pass this back to you and i ' ll uh figure out the average here . thank you for everyone ' s help with that . one , two , three , four , five , six . yeah . sure . yes . yeah . yep . i think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped i i mean i that really opened my eyes . i i only speak for myself though . yes . i can give you a number , um it ' s uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , i can i can spell it out . there were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine we ' re between one and two . i would say that ' s ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place . to maintain old technology , exactly . yeah , yeah . yes . okay . nice . so we might have to wait . yeah . um i one thing i want to do is oh , i think the meeting ' s done . yeah . um one thing i wa i wanna do is save everything in the right files , because i don ' t think everything is saved . the right files . final meeting market um almost , there ' s one more thing i have to get out of the i have to make sure that this attachment will open . ah - ha . okay . we ' ll open that when the time is right . in the meantime closing things down , okay . let ' s see what this thing does . does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? ah , we came up together , we ' re good . okay . are we ready to start ? okay . it ' s now quarter of four . this is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five . okay . right . our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um sarah present the evaluation criteria . we then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an excel spreadsheet . and i know what you ' re all thinking of , oh my , um because we ' re only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . so we ' re going to make a very fast track . okay . um and as you can see that ' s what we do next on this thing . so the first thing i have to do is close this so that i can get to where is it ? i need to open mine . not the agenda . no that th i want the minutes from the previous minutes . that should be there , minutes . yeah . okay . uh from meeting three , is it alright with you if i don ' t switch it to show , just use it as is ? ' cause this way i can more easily flip it . okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations . um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . the market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . um we decided chip on print would be used . um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , i think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . there was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . um looking like a scroll , but it ' s really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . and uh we closed as it ran out of time . is that a fair presentation of what happened ? okay , back to this meeting . um we ' re down to the prototype presentation . over to you . ooh , two . ah . uh - huh . ' kay . okay . okay . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . oh i see , the on - off ' s in the back . and then you can use your thumb . i could see this thing , unless it ' s reinforced , having a problem with the you know yeah . hmm . okay . the next item is evaluation . uh if that ' s if you ' re finished . oh sorry . try again . hmm . well we will soon , unfortunately . come on . no , . elegant . elegant . mm . yeah . the chunk . i think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . it ' s more true than false , about a two . mm - hmm . trendy . mm - hmm . hmm . excess buttons . no . better , more intuitive buttons , yes . no . i like it . mm - hmm . yes , the instinct says true . yeah , that ' s not a cheap thing to get . hmm . i think we ' re good . okay . we ' re a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance . okay . yep . right . right . and as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank goodness . and we ' re going to raise what ' s called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . okay . yeah . um what ' s a hand dynamo ? oh shoot , forget that . kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one . okay . electronic simple chip on print , and we ' ll need one of those . okay , and we only need one of those . okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . it looks like it single curve , ' cause of th the chunkiness . it ' s that ' s uh uh one . and that ' s uh that ' s the the one that goes like this . right . no , single curve . okay , case material supplements . plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . we had the special colour . and did we say plastic ? yeah . okay . we ' ll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that ' s where we are . interface button push button interface . that ' s what we ' re using , isn ' t it ? whoops , don ' t want that , not yet . um no , it just says push button interface . button supplements , they ' ll be in a special colour of black . and the buttons wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? so we need one of them . and are they any special form ? ' cause the rate we ' re going we can put the rubber on top . oh . okay . um let ' s put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement . uh we only need one of them . um and the total cost has been calculated as nine pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . we ' re in . that ' s us . okay , i ' m going to save this into our desktop , project documents . okay . as our project document bit . yeah . there we are . that ' s the only excel document that will be in there , so it ' s there for all of us . okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide . right . um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . yeah , leadership , teamwork , means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . uh - huh . okay . so , we went over all those things and we ' re satisfied with all the above . um did we find any new ideas ? so we actually worked well as a group . right . are the costs within the budget ? yes . is the project evaluated ? yes . uh - huh . mm - hmm . alright . and we ' ve therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , i have a final report to present , um and then we ' re done . we done good , and we ' re finished in time . i believe that is the end of our meeting . thank you , melissa . i keep forgetting whether i ' ve done this . . yep . ta - da . right . mm - hmm . um well i don ' t have very much to add . um the the case oops , that ' s the uh on off button just come off our prototype . the the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . we ' re not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . we have the technology to do that . um and as for the the actual components um , uh steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . we have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it ' s the stalk of the banana , or it ' s just the thing at the end of this version . um so that ' s for material . colour , well uh steph ' s the expert on colour . um we we don ' t have any particular restrictions on that . yeah , i think that ' s all we ' ve got to say really . a banana . would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? yes , that ' s so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . and it was partly we thought the design looked better , but it could be moved if if marketing feel it ' s important to have the on off button in a different place . hmm . and it ' s a very simple design , there ' s not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make . mm - hmm . yes , a plain , simple , clean design . well we have got s trendy further down , but elegant , i don ' t know if i ' d call them elegant . stylish , yeah . yeah , i ' d i d i don ' t think that ' s what we ' re aiming at with this concept . i think we ' re using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . very . yeah . we have the worry about how robust it will be if it ' s it ' s curved as a banana but spongy . i think yeah . yeah . no . so that ' s false . no . yeah , i think they ' re different , aren ' t they ? mm . yeah . yeah . well i think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . we haven ' t got a lot of expensive components in there . i ' d put it at one i think , but i dunno , what do you yeah , true , it might be the yeah , yeah , true . true . yeah , that ' s a good point . right . yeah . that was the crank , wind - up crank on the side . just one . uh uh yeah , i think we can do it all with simple just checking that . yeah , simple , ' cause we ' ve just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest . yep . yeah , that that one is single curve , isn ' t it ? um do we have i i think you it means you reverse the curve . yeah . yeah , i do i don ' t think we need that for either of them , you can do a banana in single curve , yeah . yeah , can we do some what ifs , ' cause it may i mean i i still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , but it depends on the cost , i guess . yes . yep . do we need to say how many buttons , or or d is it just one ? ' kay . uh they ' ll be rubber , yep . actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? ' cause i think they can be plastic . yeah . they could be plastic , we don ' t have to have rubber buttons , because we haven ' t got a double curved case . it ' s just one , isn ' t it ? what , we ' re in . more profit . do you do you need to double click on that to open it ? yeah , yeah , the play - doh was best , i thought . yep . yeah . yeah , i think we ' re a good team actually . i ' m not sure all the wires are really great though . i thought so . yes . yes . oh hang on , we haven ' t heard . mm - hmm . absolutely , and it ' s kept us within budget . and then we get the product launch party . product launch party ? absolutely .","the project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting . the user interface designer and industrial designer then presented two prototypes of the remote the team is working on and discussed the options for components and materials to include in their design . the first prototype featured a simple design with only a small number of buttons . the second prototype was shaped like a banana and used scroll push button technology . the marketing expert then led the team in conducting a product evaluation of the prototypes in which the prototypes were evaluated on the basis of their fanciness , technological innovation , ease of use , trendiness , and marketability . overall , the prototypes performed quite well in the evaluation . the project manager then examined the production costs of the remote . the cost to produce the remote was 9 . 20 pounds and did not exceed the project budget . the team then conducted an evaluation of the project process , in which they indicated that they were quite happy with the tools available to them , the ideas they came up with , and their teamwork .",ES2013d
"could have one for your stereo , one for your d_v_ player . yeah i kinda had a a kinda a natural kind of a idea where it ' s like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner , yeah , kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant for the more natural kinda uh yeah , just click there . uh the the maximise button . evaluation . the the product or the project ? um , well well my presentation just now ? sure , uh can i get the cheers . there we go , oh . method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . so what i ' ve been asked to do is , on the whiteboard um gauge our team response to these questions . so , on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false . yeah . and then at the end just take an average yes . so uh . so , look at these questions . is the device f flashy and fashionable ? so uh and also uh technologically innovative ? easy to use ? uh suitable for the consumer ? that was um yeah . uh is it complicated ? doing pretty well so far aren ' t we ? uh functional ? um . where are we ? we ' ve b built in the the speech , where are you , function . uh - huh . mm - hmm . and uh , what else ? the r_s_i_ compares to the current standards , well . we we uh yeah it was our it was a we made an actual effort to um will device appeal to all age groups ? yeah , uh that ' s a good call , yeah . well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that . mm . uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ? uh , yeah and what h did we make the management ' s um . okay . so uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . eleven divided by eleven ' s one so equals average of one . and that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product . uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay - out here it ' s just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . um on the left we ' ve got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . uh this is the power key , um it ' s kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on . uh that ' s the little menu key . this is the infra - red section so you g it ' ll be sending rays and if you ' re you know pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it ' ll send it . uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it ' ll still understand . um the logo is down down there um and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit ' s the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there ' s holes for the buttons to come through . um . mm . mm . yeah . mm - hmm . but it ' s also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . this is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it ' ll be fine . yeah . yeah . li that ' ll be the covers as well , yeah yeah . yeah it could stand , yeah . well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that . yeah , standing . yeah , we could just widen it out uh mm . mm . mm , yeah , yeah . have to if we just lengthen it i guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there . yeah , mm . yeah . yeah . we might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that . yeah . mm . the final product would actually stand up , yeah . yeah , yeah . yeah . wee mm . mm . mm . yeah i ' d say definitely a one yeah . yeah , defi yeah , yeah yeah . yeah definitely . yeah . yeah definitely . yeah . yeah . yeah , mm - hmm . no , not at all . uh yeah it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well . yeah . mm . mm . mm . i i i think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just ' cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but um i think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah . yeah , yeah . yeah , yeah . yeah . mm . yep . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yep . yep . well done us . excellent . oh no that ' s uh . . mm - hmm . mm . yeah , definitely . mm - hmm . mm . yep . yep . cool , thank you , mm . s and so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light non - descript grey so that people ' ll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make ipod covers , so they kinda just stretch over . yeah , well i i didn ' t know that but yeah they ' re kind of it ' s just kind of a rubbery and that way you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way i think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well and just kinda stretch it over and it ' ll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of ' em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the r_r_ . yeah . like that . oh . yeah . yeah , just kind of or just make it little . somewhere like that so it just sort of yeah . bu . fall over . yeah . yeah . . ' s a little longer . yeah . i think it is yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah i think it made we met all of the consumer wants . no . yeah . yeah . yeah . i think so . yeah . yeah i think just the simplicity of it and not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons . under the cost . yeah , . i mixed up the colours a little bit . i think i all wrong . mm . ps i don ' t think so , i mean i think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and you know , seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus and yeah . yeah . alright . yeah . okay . right well . welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we ' ve uh done a good job here and uh we ' ll just go through the the final uh the final details . um okay , oh the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh i think we ' ll take those as read , um okay the um th the the next uh thing we we we ' ll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close . um so f if if you ' d like to uh present your your proposals . uh - huh . yep , yeah , good , good . uh - huh . yep , right . uh - huh . yep , yep , mm - hmm . uh - huh . yep yep . yep . showing me age , i don ' t know what i c ipod covers are like . yeah yeah . uh - huh . okay , yep , right . okay . yep . okay , good yeah . yep , right . yeah , yeah . i mean tha it ' s it ' s a detailed point , i just wondered i mean h how will people put these down i wonder ? right . okay for some strange re reason i had it in my mind that they ' d put them down vertically but uh uh yeah , uh no because particularly if they ' ve dif if they ' re gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item uh i mean it it ' s uh it it ' s just i mean it ' s just a minor detailed point , but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they ' ve got them um because actually have several upon the uh yeah , well . yeah but that that ' s uh but uh no the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh yeah yeah , no no , i mean that ' s these uh yeah . but uh yeah but no th but the yeah the the the yeah , yeah , yeah , i mean it it ' s uh wouldn ' t wouldn ' t do that , indeed yeah . but th th but th yeah th b the these were all minor minor uh minor details , i think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on and the i it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different . um , so good that ' s that that ' s excellent . um right let us um what ' s on the next one ? oh right yes , let ' s have a look at the um f finance . um , now we ' re given a a clear design brief , uh if i get the uh spreadsheet up . oh . . oh right . ah . good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand . now i ' ve um this is the company ' s uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and i i i ' ve treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , um i wouldn ' t know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that ' s a that ' s a standard colour . uh , so we ' re just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision i ' ve had to make is that um we ' re we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and i i um i ' m i ' m i ' m certain that they they are around so , um that i don ' t think is a a serious problem . the uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it ' s it ' s expensive to uh um l to make ' cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . um it ' s simply made of plastic so th that ' s uh that ' s no problem and uh um just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that ' s uh uh there ' s some cost there . um and uh we haven ' t actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well i do don ' t know that they ' re special colour . anyway the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five uh but i thi i think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we ' ve got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so uh um you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can ' t operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , so uh we we we present this as the uh the company ' s uh the the company ' s way forward and uh uh i i think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . um . okay , uh . so um . does anybody want to uh uh andrew do you want what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation where where you know well where where we ' re where where we ' re at ? the the the well the i meant the product . yeah . oh sorry yeah um , mm . mm . more loud clicks in the microphone . seven being a nice round number to work to . tr on for true and seven for flase . yes . well i think most definitely . yes the voice technology indeed . i don ' t see we could ' ve made it any easier . totally . no . yeah . found easily . yeah i mean that ' s that ' s yeah . does it take long to learn to use ? shouldn ' t . less buttons so it must be . so yeah , um um . i think it will because i mean uh old older people who can ' t manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so and it ' s it ' s it ' s well i don ' t think we ' re actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so yeah . yeah . it will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it ' s it ' s uh yeah yeah so i i yeah i yeah , so i think we can reasonably say it ' s another another one , why not ? in in in in my interpretation of management ' s instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement is t it ' s television only , it ' s it ' s simple to use , um it ' s it ' s it ' s within budget , um i it ' s uh yes an an any minor points we we we argue . so uh i i think we ' ve done an amazing job in uh coming up with what need a need a calculator for that . okay , nick the cable back then . ooh . right do um either of you want to uh say anything ? mm . before i uh no . yeah . yeah . well that ' s right , i mean th this this slide here i mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity , i mean i think we ' ve allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows . um i won ' t comment on leadership , uh teamwork i think we ' ve uh i think everybody ' s uh worked pretty well together . um we ' ve just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , uh i think the results speak for itself and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , i think we ' ve v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh uh a new approach . um are the costs within budget ? yes . is the project evaluated ? we ' re we ' re all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um thank you very much indeed , i think that i think that ' s uh i think we can go f for an early bath . so i call the meeting closed . not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there .","the project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda . then the industrial designer and interface specialist present the prototype , showing where they placed each button , function , and the company logo . then they talk about the material they chose , which is light gray colored and light weight plastic so that people will want to buy covers . next they take a brief look at the finance by examining the materials used , chip required , shape , and color . they are exactly on target at twelve point five . next the marketing expert administers the product evaluation , and the group talks about whether the device is flashy and fashionable , technologically innovative , easy to use , suitable for the consumer , complicated , how long it would take to learn to use it , and its appeal to all age groups . they come up with an average of 1 for the evaluation . they briefly discuss the project process and agree that they worked well together , had excellent teamwork , and created an effective product that meets the budget cost . they close the meeting by thanking one another .",ES2012d
"uh - oh . this is it ? um , there are a few changes we ' ve made . um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , so instead we ' ve um this is gonna be an l_c_d_ screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm um button . uh , apart from that , it ' s just pretty much the same as we discussed last time . you know , just like right inside there . well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that ' ll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . well i ' m we ' re gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . um but um this button um , because it ' s red it ' s sort of very prominent , we ' re gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it ' ll send a stand - by signal . um apart from that it ' s gonna be used as a confirm button for the l_c_d_ screen and you use this as a jog - dial . i don ' t know . didn ' t put five centimetres . um . something by there . um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . um , were gonna have the volume control here , but um because we ' ve got the the l_c_d_ and the jog - dial we just thought we ' d um use that as the volume . um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and um yeah . um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , um we didn ' t actually go through and specify the uh what can a t_v_ do ? um . the the balance hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . um i think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing . um we have um got some push buttons as well . ' kay . so i reckon we ' ve got one button for this thing ' cause it ' s just one big sheet of rubber . i ' m not sure if that counts but you can see we ' re we ' re all very far beyond the well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits . that is one . that ' s fair enough , yeah . that ' s um one piece of rubber but it ' s gonna have twelve button things underneath so yeah w um so i reckon reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons . i think there ' s just one button so handy . yeah . you see i envision it as being um quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat . yeah it works , yeah . see , about that thick . yeah . is it ? yeah . i ' m seeing five then . one ' s high - ish isn ' t it ? ah , okay so yeah , two or three . eight three . yeah . yeah one . yeah i think it ' s about five . yeah well we have to use uh plastic so it ' s probably gonna be i think i ' d probably increase the cost . we ' ve only got like what , ten cents left so yeah . my leg . um i agree with his point it ' s um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out ' cause we don ' t have enough money . uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would ' ve been a lot easier . not just yet . yeah . oh they ' re a bit clunky . good point . yeah . is this for the project or oh yeah . do we know what the other ones are ? oh wow . hey yeah , i said ninja homer . guess i ' d forgot how good s play - doh smells . i think they ' re all non - toxic ' cause it ' s aimed for like two - year - olds . yeah it ' s not very tangible . no . ninja homer , made in japan . and there isn ' t uh d it doesn ' t open up to the advanced functions ? so the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they ' re hidden in the sense that um they ' re not in use . um they ' re in the l_c_d_ panel and the jog - dial ? okay ' cause the l_c_d_ panel just displays um functionally what you ' re doing . if you ' re using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say you know it ' s like it only has four columns , it ' s a very simple l_c_d_ like , whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast . it might even be one , a bit more complex l_c_d_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions . that ' s a number pad . um they ' re al along this yeah . you have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as well , or at the bottom . ' cause slogans are usually quite small , right , they ' re not like huge so they ' re s say a button ' s about say a button ' s about this size , right , so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that . yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button , so one two three four centimetres . plus maybe half o five six seven eight , about yeah nine total . nine , ten . yep . excuse me . sure . oh we ' ve discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? no as in the height , but what about the width ? do we need five ? i don ' t think five is be about th three and a half . yeah , yeah . okay things like um brightness , contrast , um maybe tuning the channels . um . what else ? um the various inputs . are you having a v_c_r_ , are you having you know which input do you have ? um . yep , colour , sharpness . um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them . audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid - range , your high range . um . yep , left - right balance , um maybe even pre - programmed sound modes , like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting . yeah . the battery . no . um . we need an yep . yeah advanced chip . we need an advanced chip i think , yep . let me just confirm that . yes i think so . yep . yeah . yep . plastic . i think we ' re gonna have to skip the rubber . um . yep . for the case itself , one colour . it ' s one special colour . ' cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it . yes . one and the l_c_ display . how many we ' ve got push buttons as well . okay let ' s just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again . ' cause that ' s one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons . so we ' re just estimating that yeah it would be less . no . yep . yep . how much would that save us ? that will only save you one . the other thing could be that um you could take away the l_c_d_ panel and the advanced chip together , um because when you do something on the t_v_ , the t_v_ responds and reacts as well , so the user could be looking at the t_v_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t_v_ to respond , which i think is a technically doable thing so yep . and the advanced chip goes away as well . regular chip . yep . so what that means is that um the twelve buttons that you see there . functionally you ' re gonna have to intercept so four is a good estimate for yeah , so you can ' t actually cut it ' s like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve . it it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there ' s actually one button underneath , it ' s just that the panel itself is a single panel . we just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons . normal coloured buttons . no that ' s not the button we ' re talking about . that ' s the buttons only refer to the pad so should we take that off uh ? hey it ' s back to the original . um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some some way of cutting the cost . yeah . what do you mean by profile ? no . we didn ' t have enough play - doh to make it three d_ . so there ' s one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add , and you might want to add in the report , length , width , and height . yeah . yeah . two . this is about this is about two . slightly more than two , so okay . i think that ' s something that ' s very hard to catch , so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something . the the look and the colour is something which is cool , but i think that there ' s also that factor of if it ' s too unfamiliar then um because when you put it on the shelf yeah button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning , ' cause i think positioning is we ' re kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of pad . maybe we should do the design evaluation first . i don ' t think you need the power , so no , that ' s okay that ' s okay . no , the power cord itself . yeah , so then you have a bit more freedom to you you still have your blue fingers . you killed a monster . i rate that pretty highly . yep i ' m fine with that . it ' s one to seven , right ? wait , what ' s the scale , one to seven , right ? okay , it ' s upside - down . say it ' s more medium , but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing . yep . lemon . okay , the blue the blue colours and don ' t re don ' t actually represent the colour , except for the b the the red button , they because for want of a yeah , the the yellow is more representative of the colour , but the button itself , the blue can be anything else . yep , that ' s fine . yeah , company logo . i think it ' ll be cost prohibitive , yeah . yep . the cameras did . yep . it keeps getting too big . ' kay i ' m i ' m listening i ' m just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so i ' m playing with the play - doh as well . just in case you ' re wondering , why is he still playing with the play - doh ? just about right l_e_g_o_ lego . you feel like you ' re caged within whatever y it ' s like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . the constraints do come in very fast . yeah . i think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , so time is also a very s um strong factor , and structure . because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back . and i guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , i think that ' s a very big thing , and i think the fact that we ' re wearing these things restricts i feel it ' cause i wear m my glasses , right , and that but that irritates me right it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . i feel like i ' m hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know . not not so much an atmosphere , the atmosphere is very relaxed , but the the gear yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um and and the time the time given also restricts excuse me . i think controlling is not the right word , i think the interactions are very structured . i think structure is probably what you ' re saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling . i don ' t think there ' s a sense of control ' cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way . it doesn ' t tell you , you know , some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know , not the i think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate , but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email um it it doesn ' t have a , you know , a messenger will go . yeah . okay . i think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don ' t support collaboration , i think that ' s the word . they don ' t support the team working together , you know , they ' re still very individual tools . we had play - doh fun . no , not really . i think um the the focus of it a lot was the powerpoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , and i think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things i think . it will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the powerpoint , or maybe the whiteboard and the powerpoint in the same place , you know in the centre of the i think that there were too many powerpoints in the meetings . ' cause the plug - in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that . and a lot of the information on the powerpoints , i don ' t think , you know , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , especially my slides , i felt that they just you know as opposed to having to present them . yep clunky . agreed . having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , ' cause you ' re half way through a thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump . but i think the pen is v is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we don ' t have to worry . so i think the pen ' s good . it ' s about the best thing . yeah we only needed one computer and and the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know , it ' s useful but i think too many computers are just distracting . um yep . and we have ninja homer . ninja homer . see it looks like homer simpson but it ' s electronic so it ' s made in japan . yeah it ' s just a logo . ninja homer . the the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it . you can wear homer , you can throw homer when you ' re frustrated , doh . it ' s clunky . oh , i did learn something new , play - doh is useful . no it is it is . it is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative . ' cause like you say , it ' s something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for . like we were playing with the play - doh and the ideas came with the play - doh rather than with everything else . you might wanna write that down . it ' s just , i ' m just fiddling with the play - doh , and i ' m going yeah yeah it ' s kinda cool . no , all play - doh is edible . it ' s just wheat , it ' s the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh it ' s helpful to the creative process . um it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch . and it helps you to understand dimension as well . i think that that ' s very helpful because it it starts to pop up , whereas on a piece of paper , on a computer , on a board , um even with a three d_ graphic thing it still , it requires a lot of yeah tangible , that ' s a nice word . it becomes tangible . nope . i think we could probably do it here as long as we don ' t collaborate . can we turn off the microphones ? okay we all all set ? right . well this is the uh final detailed design meeting . um we ' re gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we ' re gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , um and then i ' m gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . so um just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no l_c_d_ display , no need for talk - back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal l_e_d_s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog - dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . anything i ' ve missed ? okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead . okay . mm . mm - hmm . so w what kind of thing uh is gonna be mm - hmm . okay cool . oh right okay . cool . where are we gonna have the slogan ? okay cool . okay . okay . so if this isn ' t to scale , what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ? mm - hmm . six , seven , eight , nine , ten . so we ' re talking about ten centimetres . that would be good . so ten centimetres in height . okay um . yeah . that ' s great and it ' s very bright as well . so um okay . okay so just could you just list all the things that it does s so i can write them in the report . mm - hmm . okay . okay so that ' s like an okay button , right . okay . oh oh like depth of the actual thing . oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay . so you can power on and off , what else can you do ? okay . okay jog - dial for volume . and what else do you do with the jog - dial ? contrast , brightness , yeah , and anything else ? well of the designers what are they ? uh - huh . okay channel tuning . that ' s a good one . okay auxiliary inputs . sharpness . okay what about uh sound settings ? uh d can you change any of those at all ? okay . okay , is there anything else at all it can do ? that ' cause that ' s that ' s fine . just need to know so i can write it down . okay um right i g i guess that ' s it , so we can now um we can now have a little look at the the excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all . so um for this first part here power - wise , have we got battery ? do we have kinetic as well ? no . okay , just battery . and that ' s because of cost restraints is it ? okay um what about the electronics here ? advanced chip . okay um the case , what does it mean by single and double , do you know ? so we want double - curved ? okay . um . is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any okay , um and we wanted special colours didn ' t we ? so i ' ll have to put that oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there ? just one colour , okay . okay so interface - wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ? okay and then buttons , we have what , two colours ? like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay . uh - huh . okay . okay . four . so w why are we arriving at the number four ? where does the number four come from ? okay right , so we ' re writing down four . okay . how about these ? are we wanting them in no they ' re just is everything gonna be plastic ? okay . so we ' re w w quite far over . now we ' re gonna something ' s gonna have to go . um we ' re at sixteen point eight and well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three euro , so let me see , what are we i mean oh yes sorry , four point three . my maths is all out . yeah . how much would that save us ? one . okay so so w what ' s our reviewed suggestion ? um take away the l_c_ display ? to be replaced with a regular chip . okay . and so we ' ve got point three to get rid of . um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ? twelve buttons . yeah . do you think ? like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , how can it be something in between ? mm . okay well we have point three to get rid of somewhere . mm . no can do . well do you want colour differentiation here ? oh yeah sorry yeah then . right so ah . that ' s it . okay , ach that ' s a shame . um right , so take away that completely ? ah . and now we ' re under budget . so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted . um doesn ' t say so . yeah that ' s a good idea . just one ? does that mean that one button has a special form or yeah okay . well well there we go . so i ' m just gonna have to redraw this now . so we ' re not gonna have the l_c_d_ anymore , and we ' ll just gonna have an on t on the t_v_ it ' ll show you what you ' re doing , which i think is fair enough , and so this is gonna be one big thing here . um . right okay . so just to well to be thorough then , width - wise we ' re looking at about what three centimetres or something ? okay and then so height - wise how how tall do you envisage it being ? about that big ? about two centimetres , okay . okay . ach , that is yeah . okay we ' ll s we ' ll say two point five . okay um so we have it within cost anyway . um so yeah project evaluation is this point . um . right uh . okay so can we close that ? this is what it ' s the final spec that it ' s gonna be . someone is gonna have to yeah that ' s fine that ' s fine . okay . right um . so at this point we uh , let me see , discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points , with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , and the stuff we had around us i guess . um , let me see uh yeah i wasn ' t really sure what that was yeah , yeah go for that first . i wasn ' t entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that , but y you go for it . okay . okay . yeah . oh there it is . mm ' kay . okay . well yeah , i mean compared to most remote controls you see that ' s pretty good . i dunno like a six or something . what does anybody else think ? mm . mm . okay . i would say five or six . david ? okay . oh yes sorry then , then i would say two or three . yeah . well it has the wee jog - dial but mm . i ' d go with three or four , maybe three . yeah about three , okay . well that ' s kind of but the yellow , i mean it could be a lemon yellow colour , couldn ' t it ? yeah . mm - hmm . well yeah , i mean it ' s really basic looking isn ' t it ? i mean i ' d give that nearly a one . five ? that ' s really low . well yeah i suppose mm ' kay . yep . gonna have that on the side , aren ' t we , like there or something ? out of forty nine , i guess . ' s pretty good . uh yeah . twice that , about thirty one . so yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine , seventy percent yeah . it ' s pretty good . okay . nobody saw it , honestly . is that you all have all finished , or uh - huh . mm - hmm . okay . right . okay , great um are you submitting the the um evaluation criteria or am i ? i don ' t know what your instructions have been . okay , uh just wondering if i need to include it in the minutes , because if you ' re submitting it anyway then okay great . cool . um right , uh well next up then , because we ' ve done finance , is the project evaluation . oh right , okay . right , okay . um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points , my four points , sorry , forgotten that . you got a different uh oh yeah , they ' re good aren ' t they , yeah . right okay , um yeah here we are . uh as a note we ' ll do this alphabetically . um do you wanna start andrew ? i don ' t know , just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them . yeah . uh - huh . well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ? but i don ' t i don ' t think it means the room as in this room . i think it means like you know yeah . room . oh yeah . well i dunno do you th i think it means um i think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so mm - hmm . mm . okay . okay . okay uh do you know what , actually let ' s take each point and everybody discuss it , i think . yeah . so still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is craig . yeah . yeah . mm . yeah . so you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or yeah , but actual environment ? okay . okay . very good . um what about leadership ? i don ' t know if that means like , if i did a good job or something . i don ' t really know . from like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ? okay . mm - hmm . uh - huh , okay . so you think maybe a little too controlling or okay . uh - huh . okay . okay , uh what about teamwork ? yeah . okay . mm . did uh did you guys get the email i sent you ? oh that ' s alright . i was wondering if that got there okay . okay , um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , you know just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier . oh right , okay . mm . yeah . yeah . okay . okay . right , uh anything else to say on teamwork at all ? okay , um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , stuff like that ? um did anybody think anything was like really useful , anything was pretty un f unsupportive ? mm . mm - hmm . yeah . and point at ? yeah . yeah . ah . so do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ? yeah . okay . alright . okay uh yeah . yeah . okay . what about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ? yeah . clunky , okay . um yeah . i know , i think at the very start of today i like wrote a whole load of stuff , didn ' t click note on one , then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , and so i ' m quite worried that i ' ve just written over the top of it or something , but they ' ll have my paper anyway um and haven ' t done that since . yeah , yeah . yeah . yeah , that ' s true . yeah . do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting ? okay . i know i i like to have things written down in front of me actually , like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me i ended up you know like writing down there or something so i could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , um i don ' t know about anybody else . um what else uh any wh i do i ' m not really sure what they ' re looking for when they say new ideas found . um i don ' t know is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ? mm . yeah if we just had uh mm - hmm . yeah i i dunno i think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about the only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , i thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah . i really thi i i think maybe if we ' d like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have like something written down , just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings , but there you go . um so in closing , i haven ' t got my five minutes to go . thin oh there it i five minutes to go . wonderful . okay um are the costs within the budget , yes they are . and is the project evaluated , yes it is . so now celebrate . well apparently now i write the final report . what are you guys doing now ? you dunno ? that is lovely . so is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything ? just a logo and then like ninja homer , right okay . i think it ' s quite nice . oh no , that ' s cool , it ' s got i ' m kind of i ' m slightly gutted that we couldn ' t get plastic and rubber , i think that would have been nice . ah well , maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money . play - doh s really ? yeah . did they ? okay . play - doh . yeah , it smells funny doesn ' t it . um yeah like the stuff for i think it has to be , yeah . yeah um so to wha what are your summarising words about play - doh ? okay . yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . tangible . okay uh mm . i don ' t know if there ' s anything else we needed to discuss . that that ' s about it really . just sit still i guess for a little while . um well i dunno . um i ' m sure the little uh the little thing ' ll pop up any minute now . yeah , yeah if the meeting ' s over then yeah i guess so . mm ' kay . where are they ? ah , right . great . right . okay . right . right , ' kay . okay . mm - hmm , and what is this here ? okay so the number pad is ' kay , great . mm . yep . looks good . yep . mm - hmm . okay . mm - hmm . about nine in total . that sounds good . yeah . yep . that ' d be good , in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually , so that would be that sounds like a really good size , if you see it there . mm . is it possible uh i ' m just gonna bring up the idea of colours . is these are these the colours that of production , or is this just what we had available ? right . mm - hmm . how high is it ? yeah . okay . sure . three and a half . mm - hmm . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . mm - hmm , probably colour or sharpness . mm - hmm . audio . mm - hmm . mm ' kay . mm . or even clear . uh how mm - hmm how are we going to achieve this high - end product if we only have very sparse two point three ? four point three no ? and then where is the mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah we could just go with um hmm . mm - hmm . mm . how about with embossing the logo , isn ' t that going to cost us some money ? yeah . that ' s a freebie . was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ? sort of flat as possible . yeah . yeah that ' s what i was thinking , to sure , okay . yeah alright yeah fair enough . okay , just thought i ' d ask . mm - hmm . hmm . two ' s not very high at all though . maybe a bit higher ? yeah . maybe closer to three even or two and a half . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . um it ' s probably just i dunno if it ' s worth getting into , but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , because i ' ve seen there ' s lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that yeah . sure , okay . yeah , alright . okay , sure . what about button shape ? square buttons ? okay . yeah . sure . yeah . mm ' kay . do you want me to d um do you want me to do my um design evaluation last ? or evaluation . okay . sure . um , alright so the way this works , i ' m gonna need to plug into powerpoint , i ' ll try and do it as quick as possible . um , this is um i ' ll just go over your head if that ' s okay . what ' s that ? i don ' t need the powerpoint ? oh course , yeah that ' s true . let me get that . a bit more . okay , so what this is is a set - up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a the idea is that i ' ve set up i ' ve reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , and uh so we can review that . uh i think it ' s gonna end up being sort of elementary because we ' re sort we ' re in n we ' re not gonna probably use it to change anything but doesn ' t seem like it ' s going , does it ? yeah , okay great . uh and i ' m gonna write up our results on the board , so this ' ll be a way for us to go through and decide if we ' re um sort of review where we stand with it . okay , so um so to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , okay . so these i these i th are the and um we ' ve been asked to uh to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so we just come to an agreement . okay ? so the first one uh , stylish look and feel . yeah . yeah . yeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it ' s the company ' s colour , and i don ' t know if yellow ' s gonna really be a hit . but what do you guys think ? okay . okay let ' s go with five then . fi oh uh just actually the opposite . the so it meant three , okay . yeah , one is high . ' kay let ' s go with two point five then . okay , um control high tech innovation . we had to remove yeah , so we ' ve had to remove a few of our features we wanted , but jog - dial ' s good . okay , three ? okay , um style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design . i shouldn ' t have said colour , but just sorta . yeah . okay . right . yeah , could be . yeah . okay . okay so we ' ll go two . yeah ? okay , and um design is simple to use , simple in features . f f yeah f fairly basic , you guys think ? yeah , one ? okay . um , soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? we ' ve used mostly plastic in the end so it ' s going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price . five ? that ' s um could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? was that an option ? it would cost more than plastic . okay , logo , we ' ve got it in there , haven ' t we ? huh . and um it ' s within budget , yep . it is , isn ' t it ? okay , so we can say then that uh out of a possible or what would be our goal here ? yeah , out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . we are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . so it ' s pretty good . translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . right ? i think ' cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about about thirty one , and then invert that , it ' s oh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent . okay , good . that was just a little formality for us to go through . yep , oh hundred pound pen . sorry alright . no . hmm . yeah that ' s that ' s me . i did have one other um one other frame i thought , i mean i i d not knowing how we would deal with this information , i thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals . it ' s not something i need to p push through , but i thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um could our design involve a series of colours so that it ' s more of like a line where we have like sort of the , i don ' t know like the harvest line or the vibrant , i dunno the whatever just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon . it ' s just discussion . i mean obviously we can just abandon this , it ' s fine . i ' m just thinking about what we originally set out to do . um , yep so there . that ' s all . um , i think to record it and uh i haven ' t been asked to submit it yet . yeah . i will , yeah . huh . yep . i like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . it ' s really quick . to use . sure , um so what is it you ' re asking of me now ? or sort of our work on setting this up . yeah . well , is it uh okay i ' ll just go through your system then . the the room uh is fairly institutional , but um the main thing is , i think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , you know , as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we ' ve gone through this , it ' s not really the centre point of creativity , it ' s more just a d debating yeah , yeah but that ' s just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know . oh , oh right right , oh right okay room for creativ oh right i just looked up and saw okay whiteboard , digital pens , the room . no , of course , yeah . sorry . huh . yeah . yeah i th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms i ' d say that actually there ' s sort of a tease of creativity because we ' re asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , but then i then we ' re told okay use the co company company colours . so what do we do . we ' re told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual yeah within the constraints the yeah . yeah , yeah . so yeah . yep . yeah . yeah . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . yeah , yeah . yeah . yeah , sure . yeah . new creativity . yep . right . mm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah , well well i mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement yeah from and you as well i think , just sort of acting as team leader . um yeah i think i think it ' s i think it ' s good . i mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and you know , innovative thought with . in in reality i think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within . and so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so but it ' s not bad leadership , it ' s just sort of s fairly strong , you know . it turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt . yeah maybe not co confining . yeah . yeah , yeah . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . yeah . um did , you wanna comment craig ? yeah . yeah . fully agree . yeah . yeah . yeah , got the email . yeah . yeah , in it mm - hmm , mm - hmm , mm - hmm , exactly . yeah , i mean if you yeah , i mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way i see this i is that it ' s uh the the s the structure in which we ' ve we ' ve approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation i i don ' t know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different , but um yeah , but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let ' s say um a design concept , and we sit here together and do it , well that ' s what teamwork is . to s to say okay go off and don ' t talk to each other , it ' s actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork . um not that we haven ' t done i think the best we could have done . i ' m not dissatisfied with it . mm - hmm . i think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing i would use all the time , but it ' s um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text . um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . i know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it ' s completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in a way everybody ' s as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we ' re just we ' re actually just each of us discussing something that ' s in each of our own minds . it wasn ' t until we had this here , you know , like at one point i peeked across and looked at craig ' s paper and i ' m like , now i know what he ' s thinking ' cause i saw his book . but the b the b whiteboard could ' ve actually been this kind of continuing um think could be , yeah . yeah , yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah , yeah . yeah , because the powerpoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas i can imagine if i ' d been encouraged to use paintbrush , for example , or whatever , i would ' ve actually used it , um ' ca you know , just ' cause that ' s sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time . mm - hmm . yeah . no , not quite . yeah . yeah . yeah . sure , yeah . yeah . yep . mm . mm . yeah . hmm . hmm . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . hmm . mm - hmm , mm - hmm , mm - hmm . and o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn ' t need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . it just occurred to me that they all we only actually needed one computer . if there had been a fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time . yeah . yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . yep . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . well , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . so , that ' s kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea , well you know it ' s kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you ' re told you must now work away from your team . oh yeah . yeah , yeah . mm - hmm , mm - hmm , mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . hmm . great . so it so now we i i don ' t know . hmm . what did you call it ? huh , huh . logo . huh . mm . mm - hmm . fashion technology or something . hmm , hmm , hmm . hmm . yeah , yeah . mm - hmm . hmm . huh . huh . yeah . yeah . no , it ' s true , yeah . hmm . and some play - dohs are actually i think edible aren ' t they ? wow , hmm . huh . yep . taste . yeah . mm - hmm , yep . yeah . yeah . mm - hmm , mm - hmm , mm - hmm . mm - hmm . do we retreat to our , to continue our r reporting or what i","the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented their prototype and discussed the features the prototype contained . the team then looked at the production costs of the remote and had to decide which features to retain or lose in order to maintain the target cost . in maintaining the target cost , the team had to lose a number of features which they originally wanted , such as a kinetic battery , an lcd display , and various color options . the team then evaluated the prototype on the basis of its appearance , technological innovation , and spongy quality . the prototype did fairly well in the evaluation . the team then conducted an evaluation of the project process . the team felt that their creativity was hindered by the project budget and their inability to discuss the project outside of their meetings and that the structure of the task did not foster teamwork .",ES2002d
"okay , we mm . okay , that ' s fine . um . okay , now work a little with me . okay . well , let ' s start it as it is . okay , uh the method . there are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . and uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? i ' ll tell you why that ' s important to me . um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that ' s why i also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh i heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . so keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built . so it ' s that ' s not as easy as it s might look like . uh material study , i ' m working on that um for the the costs . i have to check out how far i can go with that . normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , i think we can just go on with that . um then i ' ve read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . the more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper . exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that ' s cheaper . so we have to make something that ' s not too difficult in design again . this is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . you have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . the switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a morse code , that ' s how you should see it . the morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . you have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it ? uh a light in indication , light that you know that it ' s functioning . uh here again , that ' s my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different morse code when some button is pressed . that makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . uh i don ' t have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light . that was it . hmm . yeah . mm - hmm . hmm . no , i think this is a good idea . but go ahead . y yes , i think so too . yeah . okay , uh mm . hmm . mm - hmm . hmm . i have to check that out , i ' m not sure . that must be possible . ja . i ' m sorry , whe where do you wanna hit the t_ you wanna we want a button on the television . in th okay , but that rules out a universal remote control . because that ' s not possible uh . uh . yeah . exactly . okay , then uh i ' d i ' d like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that ' s uh determines everything i ' m gonna do . if not okay . okay , then i go for that . yeah . okay . no , it ' s fine with me , but then i know what to look for . uh - huh . mm - hmm . exactly . i already noted that . mm , okay . okay . hmm . if we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . that ' s fo is uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language . that ' s okay , okay . huh . uh okay . hmm . hmm . mm . okay . uh but i know that the buttons are like a nokia telephone on uh one sleeve , so you don ' t have to change your whole cover . uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . know what i mean ? it works the same as a nokia telephone , it ' s it ' s in my uh ' kay . exactly . hmm . mm . yeah . i don ' t think so . no , i don ' t think so . because the television needs to respond to the signal , and if it doesn ' t know how , it ' s exactly , that ' s not possible . hmm . mm . mm . but that might be broken . hmm . hmm . hmm . hmm . mm okay . mm . but i think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . for instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that ' s in it . because otherwise you ' ll lose functions by buying our okay , i thi i think so too . and i think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . for instance uh sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different . we should not do that . exactly . mm that ' s your uh division . hmm . yeah . perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you if it ' s lost , for people that are deaf . they they won ' t hear the the beep . yeah . uh . yeah , it ' s true , but it ' s it ' s only has to do so when you press the button that it ' s lost . so . deaf people ? i have another idea , i ' m not sure if it ' s possible . mm . yeah , me too . shall we uh also look if it ' s possible to make a rechargeable remote ? that you don ' t have to buy new batteries if every mm , yeah . uh . but that ' s already possible . yes . yes . okay . uh you could make a device , but i ' m not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , but it you ' re the remote also can act as a recharger . so then you can choose , you have every decision . know what i mean ? you can uh put in normal penlites , rechargeable penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire . so but but i think that will cost a lot . uh a normal wire would be better . like a like a p_d_a_ , a hand - held . you can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , you don ' t need basic station . yes . that is possible , that ' s true . mm . yeah . yeah . mm . yes . i ' m going to try to find that out . i ' m not sure if there ' s information available on this , but hmm . these are uh comfort issues . so i think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort . well , this is comfort . yes . hmm . yeah . exactly . i think this is a brilliant product . i would buy it myself . uh . i like the covers . that ' s a brilliant idea . i never thought i hope if i have information about that , i ' m gonna mm . yeah . i would like to make a decision . what it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it and exactly , i need it . was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ? not . yeah , okay . what uh what did you wanna say ? mm . mm . mm . but that ' s the question , is it ? because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . if it isn ' t , then we cannot reach it . i think so too . i think so too . uh isn ' t there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? if you rule out functions , then uh and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it . then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it . that ' s a bad bad com commercial for okay . that ' s true . hmm . hmm . did they really said it like that ? those two things . do they realise how much that costs ? that ' s almost undoable . no , that ' s that ' s . even if i if we have this lost unit , then we cannot do it for that price . yeah , that ' s true . mm . hmm . uh . uh i but i really need finance information . we all do . mm . uh . hmm . and the design , it should differ . this is philips , huh ? philips has this . okay . hmm . uh . mm . oh , i realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker , because i need to put all the electronics in it . if we make it s uh smaller , uh less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , because i have to put all the electronics in it . no . hmm . me too . ah but . hmm . no . m i personally would prefer it on the top . huh . but it hmm . mm . hmm . they want it uh . we should just try to make that if it ' s possible . if it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information . also keep in mind again , the l_c_d_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , i don ' t know what more and that needs space . so i have to look if that ' s possible . but if we hmm . hmm . if we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . it is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two . that might be an option . yeah , but if we need two batteries and an l_c_d_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need . but it has to be a little bit heavier . okay . no , but the things behind it . space . like a process uh . i like this one more . mm . mm . i ' ll try to . one more uh thing i ' d like to say , uh let ' s give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars . shall we all try uh to think about a name ? good luck . yeah , i ' ve do we uh save the ? oh , there he is . go ahead . that ' s pretty shocking uh . which channel selection ? oh , okay . is that manageable ? ' cause it sounds pretty expensive too . okay . okay . shall i go ? okay . so , some technical functions . basically i have some issues which you discussed earlier . uh let ' s just start with the method . it sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues . so the things i ' m going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that ' s pretty much covered . we can do that . what goes wrong at the user . gets the remote control . where is the remote control ? we ' ve all had it once , i want to watch some television , where ' s the remote control ? that was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder , a really good idea . uh these are just the issues . i come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . searches for the button . there are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear . uh also symbols tend to fade after a while . there ' s nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you don ' t know which channel is this button , so possibly we could find uh something for that , yes . uh covered that . oh yes , user presses the button . um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . so you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that , so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control . and possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger si so this is basically what i h had in mind in the fade - proof symbols , locator , a sound , uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others . uh this i pretty much covered . so what we want to go to is not this one , but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons . so that ' s basically uh what i had in mind . this is not the final design , this is just a general idea of how i ' d like to see uh basically the general idea . so that was it . yeah , i think it ' s a really good idea . yeah . yeah . okay . yeah . oh . is it manageable ? is it easy ? yeah . and it costs too much to fabricate , so we ' re on a tight budget here . and it ' s maybe just a slap - on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal . yeah , exactly . and it ' s besides that , the technology isn ' t really super yet , so that is a problem in implementing this . it ' s a good idea , but it ' s just not i don ' t think the market ' s ripe for that yet . but should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the c that ' s a problem with the with the text then . oh yeah , i know what you mean . yeah . pretty straightforward . is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , because we ' re working with different types of television , so we ' re going to work with that ? it ' s an in - built menu , isn ' t it ? yes . so basically we or we could use a double - sided for less used functions you yeah , with the cover . i it ' s basically an idea to overcome these issues , because no , but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used . because if we use a universal remote control , we ' re going to have to have most buttons on it , so yeah . yeah , i have some ideas . i have some ideas . i ' ll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that i have . i heard a beep go . yeah , but we like some some curves or yeah . oh , we get the general ideas , yes . yeah , and since you ' re holding it like this , i suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume yeah yeah . so you have the up channel the down channel the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ? this is basically what people are accustomed to , so yeah , but this is just a g general idea . uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . whoa . you won ' t be able to find it . we could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up . so we have the basic channels we ' ve got here , uh the power button somewhere over here ? i usually press it on top . at least that ' s what i ' m accustomed to . what would you like to ? okay , mute button . is that somewhere here ? is that used often ? the mute button ? do people use that often ? ' cause uh i ' m pretty much accustomed to it right over here , at least in general , but it ' s not that important , no . sure . that ' s pretty much what people are accustomed to , aren ' t they ? well , i ' m accustomed to the channels being on top . but isn ' t that expensive in the entire package ? but again , isn ' t that too expensive ? ' cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station and do people actually want that ? to pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ? can can we save this or yeah . could you post some other essentials of what people want , so that i can work with some buttons , where to put it you seem to have information on that , i ' d like to uh see some of it . no , it ' s not . no . oh , your computer . okay . well , i have your powerpoint presentation , i can get some inf information out of that . let ' s see . oh , where would we where would we want the uh teletext button ? because we decided that it ' s n not that important . do we put it somewhere over here ? or maybe this is something for the next meeting , i can draw out some ideas . yeah . well , we have decided more or less the basic structure . i can put the other buttons in yeah . yeah . maybe another idea uh . yes , but it should cover all the functions , so possibly , just an idea that popped in yeah , but we could go a step further , because some t_v_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus . yes , but it because we ' re making we need to adjust to the technology . true . no , i thi oh , we ' re not going to be able to sell it for twenty - five then , with an l_c_d_ screen . well i doubt it , but well , i had basically something like this . to make it kind of futuristic . so what kind of yeah , sure . now it ' s pretty much tucked away in your hand . i ' m i ' m still not convinced of the yeah . so basically can i what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he would we like to press it in the middle ? yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , because it ' s basically the most important function . well , that would make them quite small . so maybe you ' d put them here . yes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like . so would we like this or would we like the let ' s see what we have here . okay . so i think of a name . so yes , go and finish up and i ' ll see you at lunch . yeah . wait for the marketing director actually , so . anyways . uh . see , shall we wait ? i ' m not sure if he ' s late or delayed or whatever , so i ' m gonna start soon , we have now don ' t have much time anyway . there you are , okay . uh no problem . we ' re about to start , so have a seat . okay , welcome again . today , functional design phase . i ' ll take you over the minutes of last last meeting . okay , that was just to get to know each other , have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project , so i put the minutes on the i made on the on the p the the project share , so if you wanna review them , they ' re there . i will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there . anyways , um today three presentations , from every one of you . um after that i got some new project requirements from project board , so we ' re gonna go af go after over this later . but i wanna start with uh stuff you did first , so we can see what everybody came up with . and after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts , so . who would like wanna go first ? take it . anyway , let ' s see what you have . uh it ' s still a bit open . you should close it on your own notebook , i guess . yeah . so there ? okay . if i can cut in , is it people or men ? is it people , okay . ' cause i thought it was only men , so ' kay . so we have to s we have to do something about that . okay . okay , just talk ahead . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . okay , that ' s okay . that ' s a little weird . okay , we can we can hide those under a menu or something , okay . that ' s like a button on your t_v_ ? remote , okay . okay . we wanna have a little preview on the remote control . preview what ' s on the channel . okay . that sounds too it ' s possible , but uh i think it ' s expensive , but do continue . okay , you don ' t set it yourself , it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . you want the you want it to be programmed , for example y programmed f or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? let ' s see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , so it recognises your favourite channel . okay , so it ' s it it does it recognise itself , you don ' t have to set it okay . okay . i see . okay . no problem , it ' s it ' s okay , that ' s yeah , go ahead . that seems very good . mm - hmm . okay , so have it more make it more durable actually . okay . okay , so the buttons should be mm - hmm . yeah . wow . the s yeah . make it make them bigger . even more durable uh . okay . yeah , it ' s true . yeah , that ' s clear . no , of course uh yeah . i must say that it hmm . that was it . okay , that was good . so we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing , so the other aspects , we ' ll just see how what you came up with and what ' s possible for that budget . okay . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . of course , hmm . you mean integrate them all into the circuit board . okay . yeah , okay . so you have mm - hmm . okay . okay . that was it ? i ' ll get back to my thing then . uh okay , back this up to the screen . so i got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little . like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet , nowadays people don ' t use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either well , i don ' t think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it . but i don ' t think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example . just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . it ' s not important anymore . um we ' re targeting young people now , because our um this is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , which are um the younger people were defined under forty . i so i think it ' s that ' s also good with the fashion and everything , so yeah . they want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like . if they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they ' re actually gonna spend uh spend money on it . yeah . see how far we can go with it anyway , so and one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently black and yellow , but i ' m not sure if we i think we should keep the the logo in mind , because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody ' s taste . so with that concept i started thinking , so why not just steal nokia ' s idea and just make changeable covers for your i mean those cost hardly anything i think , and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design . and sell the covers separately , for example . that ' s just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone . so you don ' t have to i think you don ' t have to make entire remote controls . we make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately . so that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . so just i ' m not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . would you like to share ? okay . oh yeah . i think we should lose the l_c_d_ screen , like you said . i think for example it ' s it ' s huge i think the l_c_d_ is huge , it consumes batteries like hell . i think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . it costs a lot , i think . what we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an l_c_d_ screen but with a preview , but y i ' m not sure if it ' s even possible . for example , a little t_v_ guide . like you have a little just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing so you can use your remote as a t_v_ guide . i ' m not sure it ' s even possible , but maybe okay , make it yeah , find a little compromise in that , but what did i write down ? i think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your t_v_ and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . i think it ' s easy to implement , we should go for that . uh speech recognition . i thin yeah , i mean where else should you put it ? yeah , but how are you gonna use that if your i mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button ? a slap - on sticker . oh , you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your t_v_ . yeah , that could be possible . a little little box you can attach to your t_v_ is fine then , okay . i think it ' s universal . i think we should go for universal , because apparently we ' re a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . i think universal remote control should be possible . yeah , i think we ' re targeting everyone , so remote okay , universal is good . speech recognition , i think it ' s very hard , because we ' re selling across multiple countries . so i think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it ' s very hard to do . yeah , but i don ' t see arabian people speaking one , two uh whatever . it ' s yeah . it ' s not a mature technology , i think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control , so i don ' t think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh . what else do we have ? um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . so the the the symbols won ' t fade , maybe a little harder plastic or especially li we don ' t maybe we don ' t have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons , so those always fade first . mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . let ' s see . for example ? well , we ' re not we ' re not targeting older people , we should remember that . everything we target is under forty , so . you assume that that they read correctly and i think they ' re the most important thing about young people is that they ' re really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world , so no , of course . no , i think it ' s just something you you put over them , because yeah we c yeah , you ca well , tha that ' s not a that ' s not a bad that ' s not even it ' s not even a bad idea . i mean , for example , if you ' re if you ' re into the durability issue you could for example , if your buttons are faded , after i mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . uh i ' m not sure it ' s it ' s hard to make . so it ' s a good and a bad idea . mm - hmm . yeah , i know , it ' s just just a one one piece of rubber for example , okay . yeah , that ' s what i something i have to look into . either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , i ' m not sure which which is easier , so um anyway , yeah , this is what we ' re gonna do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let ' s see what we let ' s see we so you have to come up with a components concept , yeah . i want some you should do some trend - watching , because even if we ' re if we ' re gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that ' s what we need to know in this phase , because that ' s gonna be the essential final design that we ' re gonna come up with . um yeah , i think user interface is fairly obvious . i mean it should be very intuitive , s yeah , it should speak for itself . uh for example i bought a remote control last week with a new t_v_ , it was it l it ' s like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , and i ' m total t_v_ new , anyway . so i think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things . or maybe just stick ' em under a menu , like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever , they ' re more complicated , just stick ' em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your t_v_ . that is true . no , that ' s true . yeah , that ' s true . i ' m not sure if it ' s impossible , but uh there ' s a chance it ' s not , so . a double - sided remote control ? i don ' t think that ' s useful . yeah , but then you ' re gonna have a lot of wasted buttons . for example you have a sony t_v_ and the half of the buttons won ' t function if you have a for a sony that won ' t for a philips t_v_ . i don ' t think we should yeah , for exam i ' m not s yeah , for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their t_v_s , not not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , but you can ' t you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of t_v_s . i think there ' s i think there is a standard for example between uh because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands . especially the big ones , the big brands , so . ' cause everybody i have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button , so i think i ' m not sure , if you can put some research into that , if it ' s possible . uh i think just a b and the navigation is very basic , it ' s usually the same thing . yeah . yeah , that ' s true . i think so uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , i think it ' s possible , just the way how to . yeah , then then you could do everything i suppose , because usually the t_v_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it ' s okay . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah i think it should be a little distinct from everything else , because it ' s either it ' s both mayb maybe the shape can be a little different . maybe it ' s a little more curves or whatever . so um yeah , this . not sure what because we have forty minutes , i ' m not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , so . yeah , but it wasn ' t me , it was him closing something . so anyway , yeah , we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . i mean what do you want , do you want , but yeah , may maybe something like this . but though smooth inside . so you have the transmitter here for example . let ' s see that you what would be handy . i think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own . let ' s see one , two god damn it . yeah , okay . another one here . let ' s see what i think this should these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here . think it ' s like this . withi within the yeah , just take it . do you take triangles or um i think it should be i think it maybe we should make ' em bigger or whatever . yeah . yeah , in the middle . it ' s it ' s usually uh there , but mm . yeah , but for example if it ' s lost in your armchair , we ' ll not see the flash . and flash takes up a lot of batteries again . yeah . yeah , i thought about for deaf people for example , so . we could do that . uh let ' s see . oh yeah , it ' s true . um that thing should be central . you shouldn ' t be you uh shouldn ' t press it by accident , but it shouldn ' t be stacked away somewhere . yeah . yeah , like that ' s gonna work . yeah , i thought maybe we should move the buttons down and put it here for example to from top to bottom . yeah , that ' s true , you should i think the bu the power button should be on top , ' cause it ' s the first thing you do , turn it on . so power button on top . um mute . do we hardly i think it should be at the bottom somewhere . mute . turn the sound off . i don ' t think it ' s important , but i think it i think it should be you c you could put it somewhere here . no , because it yeah , people are accustomed to that , it ' s can i have that ? that ' s j take this out and here see uh are we gonna take triangles anyway ? i ' m drawing triangles , but yeah , it ' s maybe a bigger lesser than thing . so anyway , i think this is should be the channels and or sh here , okay . okay , should we chan okay , this two , channel up and down . well , for that is it ' s on one part it ' s um it ' s a good thing to recharge it maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . you have just put penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it ' s an it ' s it ' s it ' s very annoying . i ' m not sure y i ' m not sure it ' s if it ' s expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea . because if it ' s it ' s uh useful to have it rechargeable , but at the same time , if you don ' t want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch t_v_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour . how about i think i have a nice idea . not exactly uh . i think it ' s uh it ' s a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the t_v_ . could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it . i ' m not sure . a what ? well , we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal or so you could put that on a t_v_ for example . it could be very flat , could be very small . it ' s a very small yeah , i ' m drawing it big now , but so you can put your remote on flat for example . and at the backside of remote just just just a little hole for example um you just put it down , it recharges for example . i don ' t think it ' s very expensive . i ' m not sure if it costs a lot , that that ' s what he r that ' s that you that ' s what you buy yourself . it ' s just an idea , we have to find out if it ' s possible . do they want but they want a rechargeable one ? i ' m not sure , you should find out if it ' s if rechargeable is important . yeah . they want to pay for comfort , we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , um and yeah , we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station . i think it would be good actually . i like the beep part anyway . so um let ' s go through the covers is covers is good . yeah , it ' s oh we can save this . up and saved . we even saved the ant . um okay . so what we have is you have i think you have to do a lot of work on if it ' s possible for the cost . maybe yeah , or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . we are going for twenty five euros sales price , but just try to find out what they ' re willing to pay for it , because if they ' re willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , uh we just have to see what it looks like . yeah , if you have some financial information that that ' d be nice , so . hmm . no , it wasn ' t wasn ' t allo it was possible , not allowed , so . so that ' s um why i ' m not sure that you ' re allowed to share documents on the on the draft . i don ' t care . i haven ' t heard any complaints yet , so . um yeah , the oh , they inc uh they include the new one . or just for you . oh no , i didn ' t have that . all it tells just let ' s make make a new tick the new one . um other side . yeah , let ' s increase it a little because yeah , draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , so the more less important more or less . just play a little with this , put l shift a little up or down and we ' ll see what looks best . or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share . yeah , so we don ' t want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot . well what we had function that what people do , so . people change channels , people they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn t_v_ off and on , for example . that ' s the basic fu that ' s what you do i ' m not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very well represented . that ' s true , but that ' s what we stick under the menu button . everything is you say in every t_v_ that ' s configured under the menu . yeah , but but i think most modern t_v_s have it in their menu . uh we ' ll we ' ll see what we can come up with . under forty . yeah ? mm - hmm . yeah yeah . the want to pay for oh . uh shall we ? younger , age sixteen and forty five . that ' s all here , here it says yeah , age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical . okay , so we ' re not focusing on this . um all the interest in features , not really the l_c_ oh here . would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control . hmm , okay ? speech recognition is quite yeah , just look at the possibilities then , because if apparently it ' s what people want , it ' s supposed to be a luxurious remote , maybe it ' s not even that expensive . or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes . me too . i mean we all do . right . i think it ' s something we should put into consideration . apparently it ' s what people want , so . we should see if what it costs , if it ' s possible . yeah . yeah , we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me . even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it , it looks still looks boring , so . i have no clue . i just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily . i think it ' s a very sorry ? yeah ? okay . mm - hmm . yeah , but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn ' t be too heavy . i mean we can stick it in in there , i think . huh even if in the worst case we can even could you give me the pen back ? so let ' s say that people would want an l_c_d_ thing . let ' s take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap uh came up with . i ' ll just make it a little bigger now . so a transmitter here . anyway . we could let ' s say we have an l_c_d_ screen , people want an l_c_d_ screen . so then we should probably put it here . it doesn ' t have to be really big , but just just have to be has to be there . think it ' s a good place , people don ' t no ? it ' s not that uh it ' s not the most important function , it ' s just an extra thing , it just you press the buttons on top , because your finger is on top . how can you use an l_c_d_ screen ? yeah , but why i i ' m not sure . uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it , ri i ' m not sure wha i ' m trying to imagine myself what it would look like . you would prefer it n okay . so we have three people saying it should be on top . okay , but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . anyways . uh this looks a little about the l_c_d_s thing . well if it if it ' s if it ' s possible wi if it ' s not too expensive , we should include it , because it ' s it ' s cool . uh we have green now uh or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom . maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example . i think this is not good , but for we could make circular buttons for example . for up and down , ma make it a circle on it , because it i think the channel button should be in the centre . channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section . because it ' s uh we ' re not sure about the size anyway , just a general design . you can make it as big as you want . for example if you take uh no , let ' s see . for example just yeah . i don ' t think if we if we even use an l_c_d_ screen , we need to , definitely . yeah , but we have to see what the si what the size is . the l_c_d_ doesn ' t have to nee doesn ' t need to be very big . mm let ' s see . finish meeting now . okay , we will . so either we either we have to decide what what people want . either this one , this this could be the luxurious one . so we have channel buttons here . i ' m just drawing something uh . uh i think this would this would look cool . you could have it for example small buttons here for some extra functions , so if your basic function ' s here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here . well you can just no , i ' m not sure if we can do that , but we could put a microphone in here for example . just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . but let ' s cut the meeting for now yes . yeah , let ' s think of a name , okay . uh okay . okay , at anyways , the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly , so there we go uh . yeah , to all . yes . sorry , a little bit of pl little problem with computer . . uh . yeah , sure , no problem . um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh yeah . um okay , and i want to open the my s oh no . oh no , that ' s okay . uh slide show . yes . the functional requirements , it ' s uh uh very important for uh the user , he he wants to yeah . the the method we used uh it it ' s not m not a slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use uh , um we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men , and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what what ' s uh important . uh people , sorry . both women and men , yeah . okay . uh the findings um uh seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . um yeah , and yeah , most th th they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it , and um they use yeah , they use zap a lot , um uh fifty percent say they only so that ' s the most important things . um oh yeah , not all of it is it on mine on my powerpoint presentation , but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . it ' s uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use . uh less important is tel teletext , uh um they use it , but it ' s not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh and but not important is the channel selection , the the hmm ? oh , the the no no no no no , that ' s very important , but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings and uh yeah . um new preferences preferences . uh um um beep to find your control , was that was in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control , so uh i think it ' s a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . and another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to let ' s go to channel one and uh that ' s uh kind of things . and they want maybe an uh l_c_d_ screen um to to look it um wh what ' s on every channel uh and uh what do i want with it ? yeah . yeah . yeah . um uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , so i can uh i dunno , so i can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what i uh so , the remote mu must see or um must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , so i can zap t to what ? yeah . yeah . recognise yeah . yeah , that ' s uh what my personal preference like . no , itself . maybe it ' s easier to to sell it , but i don ' t know it ' s manageable , but we will uh we will see . yeah , it ' s a little bit uh it ' s the end of it . it ' s a little bit uh i lost it , the computer uh crashed , so . yeah . darn computer . yeah . yeah . yeah . mm uh . yeah . uh . yeah . b yeah , and they want to pay for it and uh with more where with more technical specifications in the yeah . yeah . but oh ? yeah , with with an l_c_d_ screen you can why ? nokia w uh . okay . yeah . yeah . mm uh . yeah . um everyone uh wants to buy it , so we w yeah . yeah . or one . or when you say one two uh i it uh it ' s enough , right ? but oh yeah . yeah . okay . yeah . yeah . but b but every oh . yeah . yeah . yeah . okay . yeah . mm yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah . yeah . um yeah . and uh with different colours uh . okay . yeah . uh . and a light uh volume . uh it ' s it ' s fine , i think . oh d yeah . just and l_e_d_ uh on it . just a light on it or very important . oh , that ' s it ' s and but you r and you are reading from the t you always read from the top to the the bottom of it . yeah , so it ' s yeah . so i it ' s sorry ? no , it ' s no . uh . hmm . or or with the volume selection . around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection . i don ' t know where exactly , but wha no . yeah . yeah , that ' s better . on the right . yeah . maybe it ' s more ex expensive . yeah . hmm . yeah yeah . yeah , that ' s g but which yeah . yeah . but yeah , they want to pay for it . yeah . th uh there was not a el ask esque but but f hmm . yeah . yeah , okay . yeah yeah yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . my computer crashed , so uh i lost my uh presentation , but i have the uh yeah , but i here i have the the s the homepage of uh our internet , and here is my here is my marketing report , maybe you ca you can look at uh that and ah yeah . and one and uh wha what people want , i ' ve uh i have another thing uh yeah . um uh what i al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost , but it it ' s also for people , they want to learn it fast , not uh they want to no it ' s yeah , it ' s easy to learn wi and uh um and the if um if um another thing i want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty . um on my report , i didn ' t uh ish i didn ' t show it in my uh presentation , because my computer crashed . um they want to pay for an l_c_d_ screen and speech recognition . so i yeah . yeah , and yeah . uh but if if they so uh we can we can look at the possibilities for an uh l_c_d_ and uh i dunno . yeah . how much it will cost and um it will come uh yeah . different colours maybe . but all okay . if you ' re reading from top to bottom , i think it ' s better to put it uh at the top . it ' s j uh . but i if you if you are going to uh put the l_c_d_ on it , i think it ' s very important to use it , uh because it ' s use it uh but nee the function of it . so you can use it maximum , because uh it ' s a lot it costs a lot . so yeah . it ' s expensive to build it , so you must use the maximum of it . huh . uh . but uh yeah , i know uh . in middle of it . in the middle . yeah . it ' s the most import yeah . . finish meeting now . it ' s on your computer . uh . or and uh what about speech recognition uh yeah , yeah , but or or an l_c_d_ or an uh speech . i think it ' s l_c_d_ is better now . yeah . yeah . yeah , okay , yeah , that ' s yeah , that ' s okay . oh , good . yeah . same . . .","customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes . they like innovative technology like speech recognition and lcd screens . it also transpires that remotes are easy to lose . everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design , and that changeable covers could make appealing - looking remotes . the need for clarity of button functions was mentioned . on the other hand , materials should be more durable . the function of the remote is relatively simple : by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip , and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver ( the tv ) via infrared . there are some new requirements : the target group will be people below 40 , the device will have to be for tv only , they should ignore the teletext function , and , also , the remote should be recognisable as a real reaction product . they drew some of their ideas , and discussed the positioning of the buttons and the lcd . the most used buttons are going to be placed on top . it might be possible to use a charger for the remote . the concept of the design will be finalised in the next meeting .",TS3012b
"w what ? alri alright . we ' ll see . yeah . yeah , that ' s important too . yeah . alright . from me of course , yeah . well from us all , yeah , from all of us . yeah . it ' s a nice chorus , yeah . repeat it yeah . alright . alright , we both uh will ? or one of us will ? uh alright . if i make mistakes uh you ' ll uh right . uh well this is our design . uh it ' s pretty uh much uh like uh mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . with uh the different uh perspectives of it . uh we ' ll begin uh with the front . we have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . um with uh the upper part being the front . th so there ' s this part um which is made of hard plastic , the front . and uh we ' re we ' re using different colours . of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we ' ll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . but basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . fancy colours . um then we have uh the lower part of the of the device . uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it ' s also titanium . you can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . yeah ? it ' s a double r_ . yeah the logo uh uh it ' s difficult to draw so small , but it ' s our double r_ uh logo is in there . um so that ' s the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . then we have the buttons . uh it ' s difficult to draw again the little oval or round i think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . so uh oval , n those are here . and then we have the m the m yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh uh square buttons . and also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . we have the okay button . oh nei we uh the okay button ' s here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . and then we ' ve here the menu button and the and the video button . the yeah . and of course this low part , this is the l_c_d_ screen . uh this is what we made of it . you can make uh suggestions uh if you want . maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk and then you can add suggestions . maybe i i don ' t want to i don ' t want to suppress you but n i ' ll uh finish this uh quick . um okay i ' ve had everything i guess on the front ? yeah the back . yeah . we thought about yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . and we thought about the logo big in the middle . just so again the double r_ . we have then the logo on front and on the back . maybe that ' s too much but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . and the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . that ' s basically what we were thinking about , and oh and uh before i forget . yeah the the voice , of course , the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . and you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device . why ? well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , mean uh the the the the in the middle in the that ' s the question . uh well yeah . h what do you suggest i mean we do ? this was mike ' s prototype , and y you seemed to agreed on it . but now you have a totally different . the size ? yeah well the size doesn ' t really matter w i mean side ? uh oh the side ? w we we he drew the s the side , but you d you weren ' t paying attention as usual . well any case , we ' ll discuss it now . uh i think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea . but you you hold it like this . you ' re not holding it like this or something . you , yeah , y how do you call it ? yeah . well y y y you don ' t have it like this . you have it more like this . you you you ' re using buttons this way , or if you ' re right - handed , this way . so you yeah . so yeah well and maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , so well well the the well that ' s a reason to to to put the l_c_d_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but if necessary . but uh are d can you live with it ? uh y yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable . but do you but d you don ' t think this is completely unusable i guess . i think . not totally , well yeah but of course y you are also human . we have to take uh every everyone into account . so yeah . well uh who who else thinks like you ? we don ' t know . maybe a thousand people , or a million people . let it be . alright . so that ' s that . uh any other suggestions ? you ' re very personal again . well d we designed it , so of course we are very yeah . so and we ha we have answer now ? yeah . i yeah , i think it well l well let ' s start with the beginning , just one by one . well , i guess uh i think uh it ' s uh it ' s it ' s um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . that was our target audience of course . but it ' s also not completely um uh u unacceptable for older people i guess . uh it ' s it ' s not f a device that yeah , that ' s that ' s uh for older people , it ' s it ' s more that classical look . so uh no . i think yeah they like black of course , but i think they ' ll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also uh i think it ' s also good for them , so i think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . so i think it ' s very good - looking and not only for youth uh young people . yeah , the fourteen yeah . is it easy to t change channels ? yeah well i think so . i think it ' s uh as easy as uh can be made . uh so i yeah . you how can you make it any easier ? yeah , huge is a yeah . d we d we don ' t we don ' t have uh that s yeah . well we don ' t have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so , but um um yeah . yeah . mm ? are we take too much time ? yeah , very much . one . yeah . and i think fancy - feeling too , because of the titanium back . yeah . so well maybe two because of the voice recorder . f yeah . one or two . yeah . four ? well , it doesn ' t really resemble any fruit , uh that ' s true . but but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course . and you can also have front with uh with fruit on it . i knew things uh were going uh too smoothly . there had to be some kind of trouble along the way . my god . the what ? the yeah w tha that ' s uh that ' s a bit an optional option . no . no , d th no . yeah . no . n uh well we have a bit of a problem i think . because uh the l_c_d_ screen . yeah . no . because uh that uh y because my information says it . huh ? uh well yeah i i read something about it , but yeah , i i read something about it , but it wasn ' t very clear . i d i didn ' t in include it in my report . single well you have to use a chip . so well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the l_c_d_ screen . but if you have a regular chip , you can ' t have the l_c_d_ screen . that that ' s a fact . uh yeah , but it ' s only one half . uh it d it doesn ' t but we d then we have to lose the l_c_d_ screen . yeah , i know but that ' s what my information says . i di i didn ' t uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . you have to use it . for the l_c_d_ screen . yeah . yeah . well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? because we you have uncurved yeah . well but what what did what do n sorry , but what do they mean with the curves ? is th is this a curve ? one curve ? yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah . it ' s how you it ' s how you look at it . well then we have a huge problem i think . w t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half . but uh i hey but uh i think you ' ll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it ' s it ' s very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . well that ' s pretty uh l n not very practical . well but i ' m n i don ' t agree . i think i think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the and also the the older people will like it because of that . and because i alright it ' s not our target audience , but it ' s it ' s useful if it ' s uh important for old people . yeah . i think the titanium is very important . yeah we have a problem , yeah . w but you can better , yeah , dump the l_c_d_ screen then . well what else ? w i mean uh yeah . yeah , well yeah . alright . i agree with that . so we u we use uh unfortunately . um . titanium - coloured plastic . so titanium - coloured plastic for the back . yeah this is good , but it it ' s not good enough . so we have to use the ditch the titanium , i ' m afraid . what do we well what do we know ? all we want is a is a fancy design but we don ' t really consider the costs . so yeah al alright , yeah . but we have to deal with it now . so so titanium gone and add plastic . and on plastic times two and then we uh are there ? no no yeah well oh six . a lot of plastic , yeah . no two for the to make it clear . i want gold plating . no no um we have we have to uh fill w we ha no no no , but th that ' s not f um well you can you can double curve , if you don ' t have titanium . and that we dropped , so it it can be done . but it ' s pretty funny . we we do want to reach twelve point five . but it isn ' t bad to to to stay at eleven . we get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half . objection . well i can ' t get no satisfaction , but uh i think it ' s uh well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah . its it ' s uh ridiculous actually , but which isn ' t very practical , but that ' s the way . uh - huh . well uh they they didn ' t think of the requirements . it ' s the requirements of the user , uh i guess . yeah . yeah but they base that on on the user specifications . it was a complete disaster . no uh it it it uh it is uh no it ' s other way around . that ' s the smartboard . that ' s the digital panel . that ' s that ' s the smart a televi yeah . yeah . left or right ? well i didn ' t use uh nei it it ' s much m but uh you can uh i i sent it about three times now . uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing . the simple uh sch school board . i i didn ' t use it . i wrote things down but i didn ' t import it into my laptop . that ' s the w but also y you write things down . and i you can also bring your your your note block . so what ' s the what ' s the th what ' s the point of importing it into yeah alright . for drawings , but not for personal notes . i think that ' s not very uh i mean you can bring your paperwork along and p well of course if you have a lot of paper if you ' ve if you ' ve yeah i understand . but i think uh d this option is only useful if you ' ve got a lot of paperwork . you can ' t it ' s not very uh ni yeah well a lot of documents are yeah . mu yeah right . can we keep them ? uh . well did you really uh did you really take uh take those in account ? i half of time i didn ' t notice they were there . so but we shouldn ' t talk about that . because this is a realistic environment . right . okay . but yeah . w well th that ' s just the the environment they set us up f with . so well , for drawing for drawings . yeah . well no but it ' s still an expensive uh expensive but if w yeah . well and if and but what if uh maybe this this board uh smartboard is malfunctioning or someone . but suppose it was working correctly , what uh would it be useful then , if it wasn ' t off all the time ? a really ? anything you want . any b b yeah . l li li yeah . well it isn ' t , but maybe that thing is uh is yeah , board , a school board , yeah . yeah . i it has it is useful . yeah . this uh if it works correct , maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning . so uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work , i think then it ' s pretty useful . because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room . and then you can save it immediately . did you type that ? maybe till four o ' clock or something ? well dunno . yeah . no we must save this thing , yeah . in the shared map map . map , is it a good word ? the folder , yeah . so it is useful , yeah . no but uh radical . yeah . do you believe it yourself ? they also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and uh your big beautiful bird . maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn ' t . of or the other way around uh yeah i think so too . who is she you ' re talking about ? oh you mean our uh coach , our f personal coach . is she also our accountant ? is she responsible for sending that information so late ? oh . because then we have to confront her with our yeah . that that ' s our new slogan . yeah , i like that . blame our accountants . but we couldn ' t , yeah . well i th yeah . we have to do what ? oh . mm . bit late . i think it is . alright . no you go and i ' ll uh supplement you . yeah . yeah , it ' s a double r_ , but it ' s a double r_ . but it ' s very difficult to to draw that in yeah . oval yeah . channel up and volume ? yeah . menu for the l_c_d_ screen . well , at the back yeah . no the back . with the logo and our uh l uh no i don ' t think and the and about the side view um this the front won ' t be as thick , but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh well , it won ' t be visible . mm ? yeah . if y if you handle a remote , you you usually don ' t have your hand straight like this . you you have it a bit uh yeah . yeah . well , they lay there all the time . yeah yeah . yeah you you don ' t you don ' t grab it , you you yeah . hmm . that way , it it falls into your hand . i think . no but but well f for as far as i can see , three of us agree and only nils but you ' re the project manager , you can make the hard decisions . yeah ? mm . but what about the redesigning ? okay . hmm . mm . well we designed it to be good - looking . hmm . yeah . we designed it to be good - looking , so hmm . i think we shouldn ' t discuss any points points that long , because i don ' t know how how many points there are but uh yeah . yeah . um , no it ' s uh with two huge buttons . well it ' s easier to find than a a normal black one or something , because of the colour . but we have so few functions , so yeah . well , i should i think two , because the voice recorder is n not self learning . yeah . yeah . the two two . t yeah . one or two , another two . well three . mm . yeah . this is the last meeting ? yeah . yeah . the what ? oh . um well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ? yeah ? can ' t we do that with a regular chip ? why not ? yeah . regular is normal . simple . elementary . we we we why ? we have very little options furthermore , for the uh well we have to put that in . nah . yeah , you must change the chip uh back . you must change the chip back , nils . hmm . no we oh you you we have an advanced chip - on - print , and we have an l_c_ display . i think that ' s a bit double . y we don ' t need both . says . i ? ? one curve . well we make it more expensive to buy . yeah or we could replace it why why don ' t we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , uh titanium - coloured plastic ? yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper . but then we we ' ve got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again . ah no no . it ' s not ugly looking . the looks remain the same . well , i do think so . feel . yeah alright but then we we won ' t get there . we can dump the special colour . we l we use plastic . and plastic is already in colour i think . no , nothing . amen . yeah . yeah . but no no no no . w titanium stays there . well no because we did not know anything about it . yeah , but then we ' ve got money left . yeah . yeah . w well i think uh the case is double curved then . because you y have that curve and you have that curve . yeah well uh well y we have curves in all directions . i mean , this this ain ' t titanium , but it looks like it . pro project . yeah . yeah . and uh unrealistic . well we we we used our creativity , but we just had to adapt it to the costs . nei . uh no . terrible . leadership ? well yeah . yeah . right yeah . no , that ' s a smartboard , and that ' s a digital pen . or not ? oh they ' re both smartboards . yeah . but i i think this is meant by the digital pen . yeah . well we we used that one , and we needed it . i think . yeah alright , but yeah i like that one , but that one is terrible . well i i drew this . mm . and i made a mistake . but it it would have been uh useful , if i i could show this on the screen . yeah for drawings . n notes mm . mm . yeah . but then uh it ' s really useful , i think . yeah . hmm . thanks project manager . well i did . well i missed uh the option to uh to email , yeah . email or chat or something . yeah alright , but that ' s one n new idea . yeah . no it isn ' t . yeah . so it isn ' t useless . yeah . well you you can ' t you can ' t draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand . with the mouse it is no . uh indeed . yeah , but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and and and re - use it , and uh hmm . hmm . celebration . yeah , we can go to the bar and uh with our newly earned money . yeah . oh . no . no no no no . but nils you ' ve got some work left . i have to go to a physiotherapy . wow . yeah . it is handy . well they they wanted everything we produced , so my big bird . i think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready . close your laptop . so she can see we ' re ready . yeah . let ' s take this remote into uh production . she ' s on the move . yeah . okay . mm right . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah , i agree . it depends on the size . if it ' s kinda small , this is is great . but if it ' s it ' s larger , then you want to grab it . yeah , that ' s the question . yeah , i agree with the l_c_d_ screen . you have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . and if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . like you ' re holding your telephone . because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen . yeah , i agree on this . no , i don ' t think so . that ' s not uh the point and you might be uh you might be target customer . yeah . alright . great . well , this is just a short intro . i ' m going to do uh the ev evaluation . that ' s gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . so i made a i made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends . and we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . well , i put some questions in a word file . see if i can find them . uh uh uh uh mm . well i uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh i don ' t have to explain it . uh the first question is , uh is the device good - looking ? because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . seventy five percent of them . so what do we think ? yeah no , i know , but i have to uh evaluate it . so i have to take this questionnaire . yeah yeah , but i can ' t can s yeah , but uh , you know we dis we di we designed it to be perfect . so but we have to be critic critical about it . and i have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . so we we know where we stand . ' cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten . right , so right . uh is it good - looking ? the titanium might be uh f for older people . it you put uh put a black front on it or something . right . right . right , a number please . so the last one is seven . easy to change channels ? oh , sorry . yeah , right . change channels ? right . the power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? two ? alright . the uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? yeah . six ? right . yeah , i agree . yeah . alright . two ? yeah yeah , i agree . no . yeah . right , r_ r_s_i_ sensitive ? r_s_i_ sensitive ? four . um yeah . right . yeah , that ' s great . well , with the uh three . nah f four i think . if you look at this no . three , alright . yeah , that ' s true . but right . the average will uh come later . it has to go to twelve , right ? twelve and a half . out . that ' s easy . kick it out . yeah . the speaker . that ' s some wrong info , man . no . it ' s uh it ' s just extra . kick it out . what more ? batteries are uh quite uh no , no no no . hmm . yeah . yeah , we need to have the the l_c_d_ screen . no yeah , but no , that ' s n it ' s not relevant . yeah . no , then the whole concept is uh you you can make you can make it cheaper . but if you don ' t sell no no no no . if if you make people brand - aware , they are willing to pay more . but because we we use a brand at the front and uh i dun at the back . if you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy . if you if you make it cool to have oh , that ' s just great . oh , alright . that is pretty stupid . y yeah , i agree . i don ' t think you should dump the l_c_d_ screen . or you shou it ' s or change the titanium or dump the l_c_d_ screen . but i think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the l_c_d_ screen . because you have lots of functions in it too . yeah , i agree . osl if you don ' t have the money , you can ' t make it . so s if you don ' t have the money , you can ' t make it . so this is too expensive . so we have to make it cheaper . right . it ' s just free , man . yeah right . i want chrome . well , th that that is the problem . yeah . shoot . yeah . yeah , me too . right . leadership . well it ' s it was very democratic . yeah yeah . well yeah , think so too . yeah , i don ' t like it . yeah ? this this this isn ' t a smartboard , right ? yeah right . b but you this is just a large t large television . you u you use the yeah , but you ca this is just a beamer function . and here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . but that one . that one isn ' t accurate . it just doesn ' t work . you can yeah , but i think there ' s a big distinction between the these th i don ' t need a smartboard . yeah , but give me a beamer . that ' s uh that ' s much uh much cheaper . right . yeah . i agree . no . yeah . yeah . it isn ' t practical . right . your notepad . yeah . yeah , it might be useful for drawings . i i agree on that . yeah , right . that stefan use . no , i don ' t think so . it ' s it ' s only useful if you have to draw something . yeah . yeah , great . yeah . wireless uh wireless things . well these chairs , man . really great . communicate in between . yeah , right . yeah . yeah , i agree . well , more more information in the beginning . that ' s for people who uh sketch th the whole day , i can imagine that it ' s useful . well yeah , i agree . mouse is ju just isn ' t working if you ' re sketching . yeah , but he ' s saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , yeah , very precise yeah , mu it saves time . celebration . well yeah . you better get started . huh . oh , alright . oh great , man . i ' m gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom . maybe you are broken . you know . i think she ' s listening . i feel watched . yeah . do that . yeah . very catching . i ' m sure management would like that . oh , that ' s just great . uh fourth meeting . some extra deciding . well i ' ll show you the notes again . very interesting . well you ' ll you two will uh present us your prototype . then um i guess that ' s your bit ? i i didn ' t s see anything about it , so i already uh thought you uh you were to do that . so the you ' re uh . i ' ll show you how we ' re going to do with financing this uh design . and then we ' ll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it . because uh well we ' ll see about the costs . um we ' ll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close . well the finance uh we ' ll do later , so um firstly uh i ' ll show you the notes . i don ' t think it ' s very interesting . oh nei . uh no . alright . this is copy paste . so of course . you had some very strange layout . well um we ge we went through the agenda , and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . and uh i summarised what you said to us . so uh i don ' t think it ' s very interesting and go through it again . so uh this is what we decided . it ' s also copy paste from what we made together . so we still know that . and then uh we can we can uh use the time better . well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us . yeah . correct . yeah . mm - hmm . mm . yeah , alright . okay . yeah . alright . mm - hmm . alright . so ' kay . well if i look at it , the side the side view oh yeah alright . yeah . mm - hmm . okay . yeah . okay . w well i see , but well . yeah i see it . yes . when i look at uh when i look at this side view , i think w when i have that in my hand , it ' s terrible . if if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . but well what what what i what i agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . and how large is it ? well uh well the sides i haven ' t seen yet , uh ? they the the the the the side view , we didn ' t uh yeah . no no no . yep . okay . yeah well uh i think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that ' s it . yes . so uh i c i c well , we ' ll we we ' ll do it like this . alright , if you think that that ' s the way it should no no , when i i my personal taste is that i want it to fall over my hands with a thick but in the market uh no not totally . for me , i i wouldn ' t buy it . let ' s say it like that . no yes but yeah , we don ' t know , but that ' s uh that ' s that ' s that ' s more market research . so let it be like this at uh at this moment . okay ? no , i think it ' s great . comes to that later . um you . uh c you can uh walter . you can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ? that ' s more useful than just speaking . yes . mm - hmm . ' kay . yeah , we ' re we ' re not quite uh objective about this . to the customers ? to potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? nei . oh no . i know , i know , i know . but um well we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . uh do we find it good - looking ? well we think so . uh yeah . well , one . well so it ' s point four . easy to find t two . no . i totally agree . we we have to get get on , go through this . no , not false . it ' s one . well uh two ? y well we have to go through it . yep . two . well , no . we didn ' t implement anything about that . well six then . are the functions easy to learn ? well w i we do want we have a l f f less of an and the device r_s_i_ sensitive ? yeah . ah . yeah , but just do some we we i th i th i think this is too time consuming . uh not not towards you , but towards this all . th this is we you have to put it to the customers . uh well well a bit , so four . yes . one . and features included also one . and one . uh those uh nine uh is the fancy - looking . uh we still think so . device fancy feeling . yeah , cool man . are there enough technology ? yeah well also we have two . is the device easy to use ? yes we have not many buttons . two , three . are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? well in our covers , in our fronts . so yes , one . is the material attractive ? oh okay . okay . is the material attractive ? well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . so i would say at least two . okay . well yeah . yes , but we we have to design much more , because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . um oh . uh yes . well , look at the costs at this point . i had to fit it in . i twelve and a half . so well what costs a lot ? the sample spea costs four . the sample speaker , the s sensor . kick it out . we have to go to twelve and a half . the speaker costs far , by far the most . it it isn ' t worth it . we could make two different versions , one with and one without . but for this so , zero . then we go to fourteen point six . well the titanium i don ' t want to lose actually . l_c_ three ? yeah hand dynamo ? y t come on , w a remote control has a battery . well be for the l_c_d_ uh you had said . well what what ' s the difference between simple and regular ? what ' s the difference between a simple and a regular chip ? and simple ? nothing . well ? your part . what happens if we do how much do we win ? one . yeah . well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn ' t that that isn ' t there , because the the fronts they will buy it . the special colour . yeah , then you s then you only have one half left . uh yeah . yeah . yeah ? no , the advanced chip is needed to have an l_c_d_ display . says , his uh that was in the second meeting , i think . well i i did single curve to well you said s double curved , uh he , because uh i thought it ' s a b a bit cheaper already . we can also make it flat . but curved ? yes , that ' s curved . yes . no , it ' s one curve . one curve , simple . we have a big financial problem . well , then we have two dollars less profit . come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won ' t hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh by the way , we also have this one . oh , costs nothing . that ' s nice . plastic is yes , but i just got it . who ? you want to dump the titanium ? and make all plastic , then we ha then we ' re there . th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no - one would buy . no , i don ' t think so . yes . and the feel , and th that it is strong , and we still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , but not lose the one why can ' t i i ' ll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that ' s trendy d these days . i i ' ll talk to the managers . titanium , i thi i think this this is this is e really good re remote . but ah those those account managers , what do th d what do they know ? come on . riot . yes , yes . one and a half euros . hmm ? so ? well , no it ' s just uh all plastic . well alright . huh . four . so but then we can add the special colour ? as we have money over uh left . and we still have money left . what do we want , guys ? yes . y oh no . alright . safe . so alright . finance ? well , guys ? guys ? we have to dump our titanium , and we ' ll hate the managers for that , but now we ' re going to evaluate our project , of uh project , project . well , satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ? i think it ' s terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment . that ' s really bad . but that that that ' s that , yeah that ' s a reason , but also for our creativity . we had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity . yeah . well , alright . uh leadership next . uh teamwork ? uh yeah well i think so also . i al i i ' ve uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so well the managers were terrible . so , with their all their useless requirements . but o alright , the teamwork ? no they said , oh we won ' t d uh we won ' t uh use teletext , uh we won ' t use the d_v_d_ . alright , teamwork ? well great i think . uh well what do you , what did you think about the smartboard ? well it ' s also a it ' s both the smartboards . i liked this smartboard , but i hated that one . well it ' s both a smartboard . no . it ' s both a smartboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw . well , wi w which one did you like ? that one . yeah . yes . th that is so . we ' re now talking about the smartboards . or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an i i like it . okay , alright . yeah . yeah , it is . so and uh the digi the digital pen ? did uh did you like that one ? i used it uh just to check it out , but uh you you can ' t send that to anyone , because you you ' ve scrabbled something on a page for yourself , and then you ' re going to send it , yeah . well , no . it ' s , no , it it ' s useless . yes . for drawings , yes . but but for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . and notes uh for a meeting are very strict . so if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to word . so it doesn ' t d doesn ' t have any yep . alright . um etcetera ? well uh the laptops ? of course great . yeah . you can . b by my yeah . other uh things we used here ? i hated the cameras , i hated the microphones . but no no . no . i haven ' t looked w one time directly at the camera . i don ' t care about it . well w why not ? uh etcetera we n new ideas found ? what kind of ideas for n a future schedule what ? for future um meetings you have got ? chatting and emailing . well , new ideas found by this . not . nothing . we don ' t want this . we hate this . digital pen is useless . so yeah , for drawings . but uh two t but uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if i had a company and i ' m going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things , i and i have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive , i ' m not going to uh well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop . because this is huge uh this v very very uh expensive paper . yeah . well no . i hated to draw like that . you you can ' t draw anything uh neat . i if it if it would be perfect following . well th th then still it ' s it ' s it ' s very expensive uh towards a a just a green uh school board . yep . yeah yeah . yep . yeah . well , they are now . it is . so , congratulations crew . se finally my beer . well , that ' s it i think . um i don ' t know how long we still have . i dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . but uh well yeah , it is a bit uh well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things . i have to do that . i di did you um save this one in the folder ? can you do that ? i don ' t know what you have to do . yeah . oh it worked . two times quick . cool . this is nice . uh d design . s oh . he saved them all ten . well alright . um yeah . well where is this ? i also think so . she already knows . she ? big brother . our manager . yeah . i don ' t think so . alright . we put the fashion in electronics , but we couldn ' t because of the costs . that that ' s the title of our uh end document . we couldn ' t put the fashion into the electronics . yeah , that ' s a nice title . oh . well i ' m going to resign after this project anyway , so","the id and ui presented the drawing of a prototype . it is rounded , with the front made of hard plastic in different colours . the back , as well as the lower part of the front are made of titanium . the back has the logo and slogan of the company engraved in its middle . the buttons include oval digit buttons , arrow - shaped channel and volume controls in the middle ; below those , is the menu ( for the lcd ) and the video button . the lcd can be found at the lower section of the device . after the presentation , the product was evaluated . this was done on a scale of 1 ( excellent ) - 7 ( very bad ) on fancifulness , ease of use , finding the device when it is lost , hi - tech features , incorporation of fashion trends , and ergonomic design . because it was over budget , titanium was replaced by plastic and the speech recognition was discarded . they thought it would have been more sensible to have the component costs before the prototype design . finally , the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity ( generally satisfied ) , leadership ( the process was democratic , not happy with management ) , teamwork ( happy with it ) , and means ( smartboard was ' a disaster ' and the digital pens only good for drawings ) .",TS3009d
"hello mm - hmm . and she was challenged on that point okay . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . good . you used to have all the buttons oh that ' s good , no , that ' s nice and friendly . mm - hmm . mm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . okay . yeah , okay , mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm . menu button . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . of the screen . mm , mm - hmm . the next channel in the numeric pattern , or yeah , mm - hmm . mm . okay , okay . okay . mm - hmm . okay , well um what what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , that you can really hold it in one h you don ' t need two hands and it ' s easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , yeah ? the buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don ' t have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , i really like that . you really did a good job on that , my little designers . um and um i like the idea that the on - off button is in a really prominent place . that ' s that ' s a really good good thing . yeah , that ' s great . mm - hmm . the colour ' s very attractive . um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute and these mm - hmm on both sides they ' re mute ? so you can push either one ? okay . and this brings the menu up on the screen ? this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are okay . f f okay . right , very good . uh it looks mm looks like something i can sell . okay and now i ' m supposed to yeah . yeah . good point because we need the symbols ' cause we ' re going into an international market we can ' t have anything that ' s language dependent . symbols on it . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm , ' kay , mm . mm - hmm . for the snail , yeah , mm - hmm , we have the snail shell . he goes right back into his shell . well you know i think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that you know that would , that would really work . so i think voice recognition is our big selling point ' cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range . yep uh well i think that everybody ' s gonna say their remote control is practical . i think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance . we ' re really gonna have the be the cutest remote control on the block . so i think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition . i think those are the two things to push . the look and the voice recognition . they ' re gonna be our two selling points . i ' m supposed to make a little presentation , aren ' t i ? okay . ah , but in my instructions i think it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something . no ? yeah , that ' s me . oh , okay . sorry , sorry . mm - mm . that ' s right . can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? or well . i guess it ' s double curved . mm - hmm . rubber , because we ' re gonna have the soft buttons . oh okay , the mm - hmm , mm ' kay . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . no , ' cause we didn ' t put the clock in it after all , right ? mm - hmm . yes . mm - hmm . yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . okay , i ' ll take my file down so you can bring it up . ' kay should be able to get it now . ' kay , why don ' t you move just to the next slide right away . yeah right away . okay , well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? and i think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio - economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven ' t thought of . we can ' t accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few . and show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we don ' t s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won ' t sell any . so we have to get some input from those people . and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it ' s good , we ' re gonna get behind it and sell it . um , next slide please . okay , now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . i wanted the shape to be biomorphic , i didn ' t want anything with angles and all square , i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we ' ve got that . the size is small , the colour ' s bright and warm which is what we wanted . we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we ' ll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it ' s gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that ' s nice . and functionality i put last on my list because people aren ' t going to use it before they buy it . so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that ' s what people are gonna get in the store . they don ' t have a television in the store , they can ' t play with it . um so they ' ll be our main selling points . so um th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please . okay , so um the shape um i think is a a one . that ' s really , really excellent shape . the size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren ' t i in how i feel . i think that it ' s i think that it ' s plenty small enough to sell but i think we ' re sort of right the scale is one to seven . i think we ' re sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors . and our colour i think is great . the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . and given um the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible . and then functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we ' d disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . so i think that basically we ' ve got a great product and we can get off and running with it . yes . ah . well , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ? and so we ' ve got we ' ve still got four euros to go to spend . mm - hmm . well um that ' s mm - hmm . well as we know in today ' s technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality . so we ' re just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . and um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway . as we ' ve seen with so many of these kinds of products . uh , well i isn ' t this my last slide ? maybe . go ahead . i think that was my last slide , yeah . um . mm okay . and i ' m supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . um and we ' re supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . i ' m sorry i ' ve um forgot to do that , um . hmm ? well because i can ' t remember what i put on there . okay . now i ' m supposed to see how long my leash is here . mm ' kay . you ready . so now we ' re all supposed to say what we think . um okay so on shape i gave it a one . wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst . um what do you think the shape is ? one , okay , and be betsy ? okay , uh - huh one , okay . and how about on size ? on size i gave it a four , yeah , i feel it ' s just average . okay . mm - hmm . okay . okay you ' re the designer , of course you wanna give it a one . um and then how about how we doing on colour ? colour , i gave it a one . i really like all those nice bright , warm colours . one . one , one , one , okay . and how about the feel ? taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand . okay , i gave it a three , two , yeah ? three . two , okay . and the next is functionality where i i admit i was a little hard on our team here , but yeah . mm - hmm . okay . two , okay . three ? okay . well , um . it looks like we ' ve got got ourselves a pretty good product . um the functionality ' s the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . but um otherwise i think we ' re we ' re ready to go to go with this product . anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? mm - hmm . well then again if we ' re gonna um do the speech recognition thing we ' re gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . so that that ' s where we ' re gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . and um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control . maybe we can put that all on one button . um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . mm - hmm . no . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . i ' m pretty happy with it too , yeah um , it ' s something i think i can market . yeah . i think you ' ve done a good job , miss leader . yeah i d i do too i think we worked well together as a team , yeah . mm - hmm . yeah maybe we could ' ve used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah , we didn ' t use that enough . mm - hmm . and we used the slide because it was better positioned . mm i think that ' s true mm - hmm . mm - hmm . i think we were we were very good , yeah , mm . mm - hmm . okay . yes , yes . celebration . today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of ' em we have champagne . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . okay . okay . watch i i have my cord behind you here . okay . but we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished . it ' ll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace . oh , there we go . hello . designer . yes . yeah . just the look like , the button part i ' ll explain . okay . now the um we decided upon including certain features on our remote . now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal it ' s the led or l_e_d_ the infrared . now uh we have included the switch on and off button . now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model . then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels . we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button . menu button . yes , menu at the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness of this uh picture . we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included . now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button . no , swapping is if if example you ' re you ' re watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . yes . and at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user ' s voice and then it ' ll act accordingly . so this is our proposed model . now the marketing expert has to give her suggestion whether it ' ll be sellable or it ' ll be cost effective . yes , yes . yes . mm . abs okay . no , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons . yes , yes . yes . pardon me ? this is the menu yes , yes . a the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels . scroll up or scroll down the channels . yes , it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . yes , which can be easily recognised . yes . yes . yes . yes . yes . yes . and and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . a shell shape . yes , yes . yes , snail shell . yes . mm - hmm . y yes yes . yes . yes . single curve ? mm . plastic . is this for the case ? yes . yes . yes . no . speci yes yes d we do have special form . one two three four five six seven eight nine nine points , okay , yes . okay . on the desktop . okay . fee selling . yes . okay . okay . yes . yes , yes . yeah mm . worse , okay . one . one . one . yes . i ' ll give three . two . we can always improve , yes . yes , features . yes . voices . yes . yes . and maybe yes . yes , yes you ' ve done a good job . whiteboard more , yes , yes . yes . no . yes . cel celebration yes , yes . thank you . okay . they say it ' s forty minutes . okay . hello . yeah . yeah . uh so this is our what uh we have made . this is a model of the remote control which we are going to build . uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive um and it ' s it ' s blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a uh uh a looks - wise it is beautiful . uh and also compact in shape . uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . yeah , oops , sorry . um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als yeah . yeah because uh uh you ' ll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . and then um uh for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it ' s a a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . and and the button button ' s part uh will be explained by f francina . tell , yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . hmm . mm - hmm . ah . yeah , definitely . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah of course , and also hmm . yeah . yeah we can text . text that we can have on the case itself , we can it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons . yeah . yeah . so it is yeah , yeah shell . mm - hmm . mm . yeah , of course , yeah . mm . mm - hmm . mm . mm . mm - hmm . mm . yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah , yeah . no . yeah . this is a yeah . yeah . i think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . uh , i think that ' s the price . maybe it is it just n yeah . ami . ami should for yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . mm - hmm . mm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . eight twenty so we have um four euros , yeah yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah . yeah , still . yeah . included , yeah . hmm , hmm yeah , even my yeah , shape is one . yeah , even i think it is one . it ' s quite small . yeah , one . uh maybe two , yeah . uh three , mm - hmm . yeah . maybe we can yeah , include some more buttons and uh um yeah features . we can make the buttons few buttons smaller . uh i think they are quite big , so i think i i mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . if we want to have more features than that . yeah . yeah , definitely . mm - hmm . yeah , definitely , yeah , two mu mute buttons . hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . mm - hmm . even i ' m happy . yeah . yeah , yeah , definitely . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . yeah , probably . yeah . hmm . yeah , many . yeah . ah . yeah . yeah . thank you very much . do we do we have some time left ? uh you have oh , alright . well hi everyone again . um like before we uh i have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go . uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote and um it is to send messages of course to the t_v_ . it should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . it should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . um . should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose . um that ' s right . but uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . the industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue . she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . should have an integrated circuit board that ' s highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . uh and of course a circuit board . and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider . she would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . the marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . from her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . to do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home . um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . she feels that ' s really what people want today . and the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype . mm - hmm . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . what kind of button ? menu ? uh menu th menu , uh one one . okay . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yes the buttons are all raised , right ? are raised , mm - hmm . right . or have two hands to operate it , yeah . yes , and it sort of sticks up so that you really you don ' t have to g first go like oh yeah here it ' s on and yeah , mm - hmm . so if you ' re left - handed or right - handed it doesn ' t matter . well , i have one question uh will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ? will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn ' t have to first learn it yeah . but anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn that ' s right . okay , yeah just wanted make sure of that mm - hmm . right , mm - hmm . mm - hmm . right . now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? that ' s really the voice recognition that ' s really unusual and then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use . you know . colours . mm - hmm . cutest . yeah . okay , now uh having said that no , now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done . now we ' re gonna talk about financing . well , there is a production evaluation . is that you ? but that ' s after the financing . see ? fi see ? um . okay , we had looks and voice recognition . okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is . okay uh energy source we say that ' s battery , right ? okay , now . so we i guess we use one . what ? t cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . well , that ' s nice . she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would it doesn ' t work . hmm . oh , okay yeah , okay , let ' s see . okay , one , okay . oh go away . um kinetic source so that ' s in the energy source that ' s all we need . uh electronics , simple chip on print ? is that ' s what we ' re using ? one of those ? come on . okay , one . uh regular chip on print . no . that ' s all we need , the one case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved . double curved ? one of those ? case materi s supplements . plastic we said , right ? uh wood , rubber ? uh but , yes but that ' s just for the case material , so special colours though , we having that , right ? and then we have to interface push buttons . scroll wheel , no . integrated scroll wheel , l_c_ display ? button . no . uh , button supplement special colour ? special form ? and special material , rubber , wood , yes . okay . total seven point six whatever that means . that ' s the price . mm ? eight , eight point two . that ' s hmm ? eight point two , right ? so , we looks like we are well within budget . okay . i guess i should save this i suppose , huh ? oops . uh - huh huh huh . i just tried that . my documents , computer . my compu ah oh here it is , yes . okay , fine . save . okay good , so that ' s the good news . we gonna be popular . um . so that uh i think financing was pretty simple . now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation . you wanna go to the next slide ? okay . um i just realised one thing . in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . and uh i don ' t know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too . eight , eight twenty , yes . i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty . but i mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much . so um we just have to beware of that . i mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that . yeah . i ' m sorry to interrupt then but i just uh recog i just remembered that there was no that that was not um included uh that there was no room for any special features , okay ? so to beware of that . you wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ? i dunno . yes it is . mm - hmm . oh . why ? wh why you need that up ? i think you can make it there . yes i think uh shape is one . you you gave it a four . um , i dunno . i think i would give it at least a two . colour uh i one . i i like the colours . one . uh , i think i would give it a two . well it ' s also you can ' t really try it out uh the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but um i ' ll give it a three . uh . here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity . um . is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ? y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can ' t , with this particular item , we probably can ' t just uh add a whole lot of more things . uh um we need uh you know we need to leave space money - wise for the voice recogniser . um . so th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? uh , um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we ' re not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? uh i think personally i think uh i ' m pretty happy . um an and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ? uh and i think team work i think was very very good , i think we really yeah . mm - hmm . and uh i think we are we happy with the means we used ? we used whiteboard , we didn ' t use digital p well digital pens i guess are these things . yes , we could . uh , it ' s maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it ' s positioned so that it ' s much better visible for everybody and i think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit . yes , i think so , i think absolutely , and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier . um did we new did we find new ideas ? i think we did . i think we we did , uh in more than one respect and uh so i think we did very well here . are the costs within budget ? yes , yes . uh is the project evaluated ? yes . um then celebration . so i i thank you all very much . um , i think this was very good and um i think we did come up with a new product that ' s uh feasible . feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view . so , thank you . i always get it on here , but getting it off is ah yes we have time later but we don ' t","the project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting , detailing the main points of each person ' s presentation . they do the prototype presentation which includes a model of the remote control . the group discusses this proposed model , approving of the small size and look of it . they goes over finances and are pleased to find that they are well within budget . however , while the marketing expert is doing the product evaulation the group realizes that they neglected to calculate voice recognition into the financing . their cost had been 8 . 20 euros and they have 4 . 30 left to cover it , so they decide to settle for whatever quality it will buy . they rate their product on its shape , size , color , feel , and functionality . they discuss the project process , talk briefly about adding more features , and one member suggests eliminating a mute buttons and include a diffferent feature . they are happy with the creativity , leadership , and teamwork within the group , and close the meeting by thanking one another .",IS1009d
"is it working ? and so think of this concept . um to research it i ' ve um had a look on the the homepage again . it ' s provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls . um there ' s a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , um so i ' ve taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um so then this we ' re looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , um the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . um what i found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . um they ' re not very attractive to look at , and they ' re not very comfortable to hold , they ' re i just hold ' em like big bricks , and they ' re very easily lost . um they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can ' t really see them . um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . um for instance , the stand - by button isn ' t always red , uh it really should be . it ' s uh something the user then uh identify with . this is a red switch off , that ' s how it should be . um i ' m not sure if there ' s any other examples of that , but something to look out for . um there ' s a problem that i ' ve i ' ve got couple of preferences for the the end control um i get ' em with the the red colour button for stand - by and s the other examples of that um the buttons should be large . they shouldn ' t be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . they should be easy to press , very comfortable . um one of the examples given on the homepage was um there ' s an up and down volume button but both of them have a v_ on them , so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that ' s kinda confusing . um should avoid s things like that . um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie - in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea . fantastic . um any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they shouldn ' t be on the um shouldn ' t be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort . um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody ' s voice , maybe they got a cold or um we should definitely avoid the big square block look . that ' s just wrong . and um we got an email uh from i think it ' s the the research department , and they ' ve said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question . so it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take and possibility . right and these are problems i ' ve had with it . um i don ' t know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . i think it ' s um , fashion into electronics . and we don ' t know how flexible the colour scheme is . i mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they don ' t say you know if we can use any other colours at all or that ' s it . i think i ' m cool . right . right . um i think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit . um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand . see i ' m i ' d quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape . um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . um something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside or uh you have volume controls about there . so i reckon it ' d look quite nice if we just had um this here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . i think that might scare me . i think that ' d probably scare me . you turn it on your control possessed s . um nah . um well i think the advanced ones the the ones you don ' t usually use could be hid inside . b um i think the we had were fairly basic ones , they ' d have to go on the the front somewhere . um yeah i think so yeah . mm . well , but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button , the number part . uh but yeah . mm . ' s to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is , so in that sense so it does kind of make sense , yeah . yep . yep . yep . mm - hmm . no . yep . mm - hmm . yep . it ' s probably not sending . yeah . yep , there it is . and the play - doh ' s yellow . cool . mm - hmm . mm ' kay um . oops . yeah okay . let me just get this going first . ah there it is . ' kay , that should be it . okay um i guess the same thing again , i started with something very basic . so just so you guys have some idea of what ' s involved in my process , um and then you can just work through it and we ' ll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are . um the components are exactly the same . um i think , like what you guys said , um the most input that ' s needed is basically in the user interface . the rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . um like you said time to market was a problem , um and how many components are physically in there in cost . and the power is basically a factor of that . um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , um and that would have some inte impact on how y i think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we ' ve said we ' ve defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . so um you know it ' s just a matter of working out space . so i guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size . these are the three things that um will have an impact on you . so just go through it in the components . um these are the options that are available to you , um i ' m not very sure about the voice thing ' cause i got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . i it said something about a sensor but never clarified that . so maybe if you well i could see the other email that they sent you , um ' cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa okay so your basic components are buttons , okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , okay there ' s an l_c_d_ display , um i think these are quite standard things . no um they ' re well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . i ' ll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later . okay um then there ' s um how the case actually looks . it can actually be flat or it can be curved , um and then the different types of materials that you can use , um i don ' t think you can use them in a combination , um but um i could check back for you , but i don ' t think you can actually use them in a combination . um i think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , i wasn ' t i ' m not very sure about the titanium . they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium . um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , so i think that there is some restriction on um i think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . you know as opposed to two . um and the other components are logic chips , um again i ' ll i ' ll go back to the component chips . the com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit um and that impacts cost . um i don ' t think the logic chip has a issue about size ' cause they should be about the same size . power consumption should be about the same . um i think the main impact is complexity , um and the other thing is um the power options . um the first one is a standard battery . okay the second one i think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it ' s a wind - up you know , a crank . yeah but that that might be something i think that ' s more of a look and feel decision because i don ' t think you can have one power source if you ' re using the alternative power sources . i think whatever it is you still need a battery ' cause i don ' t think anybody wants to keep doing one thing . okay the other ones are a solar powered cell , which may not be a great idea in europe or any country that has seasons ' cause half the year you ' d be dead . so like what i said , you probably need like a battery and something else . um and the kinetic one i guess for me is the most interesting one because it ' s movement and people like to fiddle with their and it ' s a nice sales gimmick i think . from a marketing gimmick it it ' s a technology thing , it ' s a shake it it doesn ' t work , shake it , knock it or something . you know you know you have you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . you know just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , kind of you know just uh you know um so . um okay my from my role , i don ' t think that personal preferences but role preferences , i think um something comfortable to hold , um small and slim i guess that ' s more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can ' t , you know like a phone or something , too small phone . um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so . um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions . um the user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the l_c_d_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . um the case okay with a rubber case you can ' t have the solar panels . okay with the titanium case , let me just check that um , titanium case can ' t be curved , it has to be square . okay um there ' s no restriction on the plastic , and it can ' t be curved on the wood . so that ' s again , i don ' t think you can use them in a combination , um especially the titanium i i suspect they ' re very fixed to a particular need . so um mixing them may not be a good idea um yep . that ' s it . um i think we could because the l_c_d_ panel requires power , and the l_c_d_ is a form of a light so that are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light , or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know frankenstein , it ' s alive . okay . okay . okay . um that ' s why i think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch um it ' s probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . so you could trigger that to a light , like i said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the glowingness . i think he made that . is there a particular shape that you ' re interested in ? like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ? does it need with a square thing wha yeah ' cause that will n help narrow down the choice of like fruit . i ' m thinking fruits in my head , but that ' s tacky . do we need an l_c_d_ display ? what what ' s the functionality of that ? yeah but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it ? putting in lights is cheap but putting in an l_c_d_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a mm - hmm . i think that will be a problem because we don ' t have an input device to get the listings into it , so um it ' s a bit nuts to get the monday tuesday wednesday you know . um i i ' m not saying there ' s no need for an l_c_d_ display , but um it ' s what ' s what what would it tell the user , ' cause the l_c_d_ tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? we have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ? um you could put a game on it . when the t_v_ dies you can play with the remote control . where would you physically position the buttons ? um i think that that has some impact on on on many things . um maybe you wanna draw onto the yep . no , like i said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it ' s not gonna charge the battery , it ' s just yeah . yep . yes yes . or even a clear case . um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , but in the dark it sort of , it ' s alive . um in in a slight subtle way . yeah yeah . yeah . or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . you know you have cordless mice and they don ' t eat that much power right . so the power the battery in that sense , maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that sort of yeah but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn ' t make it freaky . the question is when you ' re rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? do you want ' em to roll it like that ? do you want ' em to roll it like that ? ' cause in a mouse your hand ' s in a position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . that ' s a very unnatural motion to yeah . can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . um it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , but not for channels right . if you have a telewest box you ' ve got like , you don ' t have to buy all the channels , you ' ve about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to . um and i don ' t think having that you know too quick too slow kin it ' s confusing to the i dunno . but users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they ' re like because that ' s becomes the most accessible thing in front of yeah . so you wanna expand the shape of the that that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you ' re left handed or you ' re right handed you might be locking yourself in . could i just could i just jump in and suggest something quickly ? um i think one thing would be the jog dial ' cause that ' s gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um yeah that ' s what i was thinking the a slide , because then you you don ' t have to put the hand . i think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward . there ' s lots of space for it um yeah but it ' s also a a marketing and a function yeah . feel like fruit . fruits kids . no like yeah yeah . yeah yeah kinda like that yeah . play - doh time . you got to choose first . no , we ' re kidding . okay , can i just swipe your power cable , i don ' t think it matters . okay lemme okay , i ' m gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left . it ' s you . argh . this is a real hassle and a oops . i ' m gonna take the microphones , ' cause it ' s too lazy t take them off again . cool . okay . okay , well okay . okay we all ready to go ? well how um on the in this meeting then if we um i ' ll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we uh decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non - rechargeable battery - powered , that we ' re gonna group our audio - visual and other functions into into those categories , um . and i told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . um so that was the last meeting . is there anything have i forgotten anything ? is that everything ? okay . um so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you ' re gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we ' ll have all the discussion at the end . that might be a better idea this time . and so if we start off uh with andrew and then craig and then david , if that ' s alright . um and then after that we ' ll have to make some decisions about stuff , right . so if you wanna take this . screwed in quite tightly . uh what did uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? we did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn ' t made a definite decision on that ? right . oh i should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product . so um that ' s kind of the end result hopefully . uh - huh . hopefully appear in a wee second . up there we go . oh no . oh right . here we go . okay . mm - hmm . aye a fair point definitely . okay . aye right . uh - huh . okay . okay okay . mm - hmm . mm that ' s true , yeah . mm ' kay . great . okay . yeah . ah . okay . that ' s great . uh - huh . okay great . um thank you for that . uh craig do you wanna uh plug yours in then ? mm . not quite . oh something coming now , yeah . there we go . mm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . okay . i think it ' s yellow because like the website is yellow and there ' s a band at the bottom is yellow , so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there , but keep going and we ' ll discuss it after . mm - hmm . mm ' kay . mm . aye that ' s a good idea , yeah . yeah . okay . okay . yeah that that was very good , and uh now with david . i know it ' d be handy , wouldn ' t it . do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um yeah . mm - hmm . hmm . mm . mm - hmm . we you couldn ' t have like plastic and rubber ? yeah . mm ' kay . okay . mm - hmm . i ' ll clear one of these things for you . just by moving it yeah . mm . mm - hmm . mm . w yeah . uh yeah yeah , i see . yeah . i know what you mean yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm . okay . okay . right . okay . right can i yeah well yeah it ' s just i ' m quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we ' ve left so but yeah you c ask away . mm . why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of ? uh - huh . yeah . yeah yeah yeah . like a phone yeah , like the backlight in a phone . okay cool . yeah . mm . mm . okay . okay . right okay um well let ' s just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we ' ve got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . so um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product . so back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . um i mean what does everybody think about does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ? i mean that ' s kind of the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? so maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you ' d hold onto comfortably or so something quite curvy ? okay um right okay . colour - wise i mean you made a re uh was it you or uh i can ' t remember who made the point about how if you ' ve a nice bright colour you ' ll not lose it , was that whose about how if you have a bright colour you ' ll not lose it so much . um and when the corporate colour is yellow , i mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow i don ' t know . um and then obviously the uh the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? that ' s all . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . okay . right . oh you know like in circular in shape or choice of material yeah . ' cause i i i was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they ' re plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch . it feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . and then then we could have curved shapes , ' cause wood or titanium , yeah , it ' s gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and i think we might be moving away from that you know so um well i ' m do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or no i don ' t think we do either . okay right well um so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . a snowman shape ? uh - huh . that ' s quite a distinctive shape , that would be good wouldn ' t it . yeah so yeah should we go with that ? do you wanna draw it on the board ? ooh that ' d be good . mm - hmm . so call it the snowman - shape trademark . yeah that ' s cool . um and i mean colour - wise what does everybody think ? i think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . i mean do you want the whole thing yellow , maybe like yellow and white do you want something uh - huh . okay cool . um and also i mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? the fact that it talks to you , i mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , i dunno . or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . i d i d any thoughts on that at all ? i know . um unless an a i mean if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an l_c_d_ display , where would we put that ? would we put that on the inside or it ' s bound to increase the cost of it a lot , i would ' ve thought . yeah . mm oh yeah that ' s true . yeah . so so no need for an l_c_d_ display ? i think that would make it very complex . yeah . yeah . i don ' t know if there is really , no um i would say no need for a talk - back . uh does anybody disagree with that ? no ? easy . okay um right so you ' re gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , um i mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you ' re thinking ? okay . okay right um what else do you need to talk about ? so i ' m just gonna um pop this in here ' cause i have a slide about decision making which i ' d forgotten about . oh sh god we ' ve got five minutes um okay uh back we go . um energy what do you think that ' s suggesting we ' re how we ' re powering the thing ? i really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you ' d have the back - up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , i mean what does anybody think about that ? okay . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . well i suppose that if you ' re if you ' re away and you ' re not using it , then you ' re not using any power either . so you ' d have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea i ' m really sorry we ' re gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don ' t have as much time as i thought . um so i think that ' s what energy is referring to here . chip on print , is that that ' s an industrial design thing , is it david ? okay um as for the case , kind of discussed that yeah i know we ' re gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of okay . mm - hmm . mm ' kay . could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that . aye that would be a good idea . s so like cur slightly transparent case , so it ' s yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . is that what you mean ? okay . lights . okay . mm . yeah . yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn ' t you ? if you ' re holding it in your hand you could do you think ? okay . mm . yeah okay okay um yeah . okay . okay . just okay um right well wouldn ' t it we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly . um i ' m all for them actually , i think they ' re quite you know th very quick to m to use . so does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? no . and the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? uh - huh . uh - huh ooh okay , we really gotta wrap up so yeah . okay well if we can do that , great . yeah okay . yeah let ' s let ' s try and get the slogan on there um , and mm . okay . right i ' m gonna have to i ' m really gonna have to hurry you on here ' cause we ' re we ' re actually over time . um is there anything anybody ' s unsure about ? just for in closing just the next meeting ' s gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , uh i know that the designers are gonna be working with play - doh on that . so um that ' ll be that ' ll be good . um and i ' ll get the the minutes up as soon as possible . anything at all you think we haven ' t discussed that we need to ? is everybody kind of happy about what they ' re gonna be doing ? okay . that ' s kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah . okay . yeah . to make something flush with the case ? okay right . okay . sp kinda grippy ? okay . okay i ' m gonna have to i ' m gonna have to call this to a close ' cause we ' re way over time . so um that ' s really good , like we ' ve s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so . so off you go and design stuff wooh . yeah quite jealous actually . yeah . yeah , sure . it kinda does make sense , doesn ' t it , because when we get into the end of meeting we ' re kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything i have is kinda background . mm - hmm . uh that sounds . sure . okay . sure . yeah , cool . why don ' t i get that ? hmm . okay . okay . um alright so c is it function f_ eight ? hmm . come on . i think it ' s working . okay great s so let me just start this . okay great . so um uh s move on . uh - huh oh where ' d it all go ? it ' s not good . okay lemme just see where i can find it . this looks more like it . i think i just opened up the template . sorry about that . okay alright so let ' s have a look here . okay so this was the method that um i ' ve taken . uh basically what i wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is i want to show you all the background information i have that i think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . and uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that i ' ve dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . um so i ' ve tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project . does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ? i thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that ' s why i suggested we get in this . okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy . um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , i think , creative about it . number two was that it be innovative . okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um quite user friendly while still having technology . so it i ' ll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that i think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . for example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what i mean , like , or it ' s got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use . so how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? well that ' s i guess where we ' re gonna go with this . okay then there ' s the other aspect of the back the the market um research i have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we ' ve agreed is a priority . uh top european fashion trend um that i read about says there ' s this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , especially in clothes and furniture . and when i first saw that i thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it , do you know what i mean ? so my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . um ' cause i think what we ' re in what we ' re in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um so i think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , i think that would be pushing it . and then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . so um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year ' s mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , i think that ' ll be in our favour . um so these this is the summary of everything . um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we ' re selling to . uh innovative design technology ' s also a must in that it ' s seen it ' d be seen to be uh cutting edge , uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . that was like the number three thing . and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that ' s the way i interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so i ' ve written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , mac ipods , something which is , i ' d have to say very high - tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there ' s like no buttons . you know what a mac ipod is ? i ' m thinking however mac ipod is sort of last year ' s because it ' s very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so i ' m thinking if we imagine that we ' re taking some of the features of a mac ipod and we ' re then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . um and then so this is w with all that information what i ' m what i ' m suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . sort of like a i dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . um does that make sense ? yeah . so so like i threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , i dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it ' s just an idea , ' cause i ' m thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that . like um the ones the ones which i ' m most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . like i see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and so anyway it ' s just just an idea . i ' m thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up . how can we build on that ? maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so . anyway those are that ' s all i have , but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into yep . did you press f_ eight ? yeah . okay , do we have a corporate colour scheme ? i didn ' t know . okay . okay . okay . yeah . mm - hmm . mm . mm . great . lots of good information there . it ' s a shame the cable wasn ' t just in the middle of the table , huh ? just um it takes a second , doesn ' t it ? mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm . mm - hmm . they ' re standard , aren ' t they ? yeah . hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . hmm . hmm . no . yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . hmm . yeah . hmm . hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm mm - hmm mm - hmm . mm - hmm . it can ' t be curved . okay . uh question on can i ask a question ? okay . can we uh power a light in this ? can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? okay . so maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery . well i mean i ' m thinking it might be that for uh this to be a high - tech thing it ' s gonna have to have something high - tech about it and that ' s gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that a realistic goal i think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ? illuminate the buttons . yeah it glows . well m i ' m thinking along the lines of you ' re you ' re in the dark watching a d_v_d_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , and that ' s what everybody does . oh where ' s the volume button in the dark , and uh y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something . like a phone , yeah yeah . whereas with phones , people charge them once a week . we ' re gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don ' t have to charge their r remote control every few days . but are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? right . sure . okay . right . mm - hmm . okay , great . okay . okay . yeah . yeah . what ' s that ? yeah . okay . well i mean i ' m thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts , and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um the look and feel . so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour , you said company colour yellow . i mean if we think of something , like i was saying also lime and lemon you know , what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . we just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the shapes and things . yeah . yeah . no no no not at all . it ' s more more just that we we think about like what it is we ' re trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . do you know what i mean ? right , sure . yeah . um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a can you like yeah just t we can visualize it . okay . okay . yep . mm . what would it achieve ? well l_c_ well i ' d when you used to mention the l_c_d_ i ' d think i wonder what that would be about . and the th the thing i could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings . so as you scroll through , ' cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . right , okay . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm not real mm - hmm . no . mm mm . well i i was just yeah . yeah . yeah , sure . um i ' ve had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you ' re committing the user to moving it , and watches yeah sure , okay , right , okay . support for it . i mean just it ' s just worth pointing out because like i ' ve i ' ve known i ' ve known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , and it ' s just like magic because it ' s always powered and there ' s no battery . i ' ve also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it ' s just too much of a nuisance because i don ' t wear it all the time . like remote control is similar , you ' re away on vacation , i dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down . so we should think about yeah . yep . and this size here , i ' d suggest this be small , like quite small . um just a a lot of the um i mean one of the things running through my mind right now , i realise we ' re being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low - tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it ' s almost like we ' re reproducing the same old remote control that ' s out there . should we think about how we are actually getting this high - tech user friendly uh um theme like what is it that we ' re u we ' re using to to achieve those goals ? like okay so so backlighting , that would be good . yeah clear , that ' d be okay . yeah sure . yeah that ' d be really good . yeah . sure . yeah , yeah . yeah . sure . yeah they they emanate a light through it . ' kay . yeah , mm - hmm . um and then the other thing that we we ' re s we ' ve committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so i ' m thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled , ' cause that ' s the main thing people will f wanna do . could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? or yeah . mm - hmm . well why don ' t we do it like a mouse then ? yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah , sure . mm . yeah . but that ' s not a bad thing is it ? because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button . jog dials are much easier than that . you just roll . yeah . yeah . yeah like i mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , i wouldn ' t be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , i dunno , that it ' s within the shape of the hand , it ' s quite small i dunno . yeah . it ' s small , and that we ' ve got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , and that yeah well i mean isn ' t that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now ? yeah . and then like a jo and then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like i dunno like here , in with the it would get bumped , it ' s doesn ' t really fit with your hand . yeah . or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here . a jog di yeah . it ' s kind of yeah yeah . huh . um yeah i think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , that ' d be great . yeah . yep . sure , yeah , yeah and materials we sorta said we ' d do plastic and rubber , didn ' t we , and i think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , ' cause that ' d just be so standard . something a bit more flush , yeah , or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well , so that it has and also t plastic i ' ve seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . they feel kind of like um , you get pens now and then that you ' d think that they were rubber but they ' re not , they ' re actually just plastic that ' s textured , kind of a little bit like okay . okay .","the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting . the marketing expert discussed his findings from trend watching reports , stressing the need for a product that has a fancy look and feel , is technologically innovative , is easy to use , and incorporates some aspect of fruit and vegetables in its design . the interface specialist presented research on the appearance of current remotes , concluding that current remotes are generally unappealing in terms of look and usability . the interface specialist presented ideas on how to remedy the unappealing aspects of current remotes in the team ' s design and also how to incorporate the corporate color scheme into the design . the industrial designer presented options for materials , components , and batteries and discussed the restrictions involved in using certain materials . the team then discussed options for the shape and color scheme of the remote , as well as what components , batteries , and materials to use .",ES2002c
"f_ eight , w . function f_ eight . thanks . can you see ? do you think is it uh , function eight yeah ? oh right . okay . okay . i ' m the user um user interface designer . uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . um , in this case it ' s the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . by taking inspiration from other similar designs , we ' ll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . there ' re two functional design options . a multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . and a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . sorry . um , a single function just for the television itself . yeah . um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . a single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . um , i think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it ' s easier to use . it ' d be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . and less functions would have to be included . so it would be cheaper to make . and probably more sellable just because it ' s more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . does anyone have any questions ? well , it ' s just that , when we ' re creating it , we ' re , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices . and it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , yeah , other entertainment devices . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . and with this we ' ll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . we ' ll have more money to go into the design side of it . yeah . yeah . it ' s um it has t_v_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . no , li yeah . yeah . and you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it ' ll come up . very basic internet , yeah . but you have yeah . but you have no interaction back with it , you know . like the internet you can send emails and you ' ve no interaction . yeah . yeah . uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ? tuning them in at the very start . you know if you get a new t_v_ set , you tune in all the channels , do you th do you think ? yeah . yeah . repeti uh . yeah , yeah . i think it is . yeah . mobile phone . yeah . yeah . could it it it would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . but that would probably be yeah . that would be good , yeah . yeah . might be quite expensive to do that though . and we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend on a remote control . like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they ' re just starting out and , yeah . yeah . yeah . early twenties , that ' s the kind of age group . twenties . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . i think it would be annoying though if i don ' t use teletext that much , but if it was on your t_v_ , you ' d want to be able to use it , if you ' d yeah . so is it just okay . alright . right . i don ' t know . i don ' t know . yeah . okay then . yeah . would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ? ' cause uh isn ' t our remote control for all t_v_s , so you ' d ha yeah , with the button that you pressed . yeah . c ' cause then it would only be a applicable to one t_v_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something . yeah . yeah . yeah . would it need a battery then ? yeah . i i like the light up suggestion . i think that would be better . ' cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so i would go for well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn ' t it ? like raised . yeah . could be raised . just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ? yeah . yeah . that , i think that ' s good , yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . no , i wouldn ' t say so . that ' s good yeah that a good idea . yeah . yeah . that , yeah , that ' s a good idea . yeah . yeah . for visually impaired , yeah . yeah . if i was thinking though , if it was glow - in - the - dark , you could put the um real reaction symbol as glow - in - the - dark , and then it would be constantly advertised . yeah . yeah . yeah . okay . yeah . oh yeah . interchangeable thing ? that would be good . yeah . yeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . y could buy extra yeah . that ' s a good idea . yeah . no . oh yeah . if w no . okay . oh , function f_ eight . that looks right . i ' m sorry , what was that last one . multifunctional and ch oh , i see . ' kay . so as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ? right . d_v_d_s and v_c_r_ ? okay . yeah , i think i agree with the single design thing for now , because we ' re trying to do so much , that if we ' re trying to make a unique , user - friendly , dadada , and it ' s also multi also multifunctional , um , we ' re gonna go over budget for one thing . so mm - hmm . mm , ' kay . yes i am . oh , i ' m not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready . okay . okay . oh . i just lost my microphone . just a moment . okay . so i ' ll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . um , and i ' ll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick - off meeting , with the coffee machine ? the functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . um , so what i ' ll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . um , i ' ve done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . and i ' ll show you my findings . oh , and firstly i wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . so we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . so i think that should be our priority here . um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . not just in electronic fashion . so that it ' s something that fits in the household . um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , you know who ' s famous , what t_v_ shows are being watched , um , to influence our remote control . okay , so the findings . um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . which is a , quite a significant number . um , the other twenty five percent didn ' t specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . yeah , they ' re willing , they ' re willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . as opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . um , so it is something that people care about . it ' s not , it ' s not ignored in the household . um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . they ' re you know thumb - masters . um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . that a very small amount . thought that was interesting . yes . and actually to go with that , i ' m gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they ' re used . and uh how important the uh users find them . so the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . hopefully the person ' s not turning on and off the t_v_ . um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . so people wanna be able to turn on the t_v_ with the remote control . um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . that ' s a huge amount . this is the most important button . um , so obviously when commercials come on they ' re changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that ' s not gonna run down . relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . and it ' s used on average four times an hour . not as much as channel selection , but still significant . um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . relevance is two . screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . um , and relevance of one point five . we ' re getting to specific statistics here . teletext , um , now i ' m not too clear on what that is . i don ' t know if you can help me . flipping pages . is that so like a running banner , underneath oh . okay . okay . like tells you the weather , and okay . right . alright . well i guess i ' m not with it , because i wasn ' t but it ' s , it ' s being used fourteen times an hour . um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . so it looks like something that we ' re gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . um , channel settings . zero point zero one times an hour . relevance of three . channel settings . p sorry . changing the channels ? oh , okay . yeah . okay . um , so it ' s not used very often , but people still find it relevant . okay . um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . remote controls are often lost somewhere . so that was already discussed by poppy . how we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . so it should be very user - friendly , you know . people know what to do very quickly . um , remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ . ah . is that what it is ? people with arthritis and such ? um , maybe our designers can look into that . um , buttons that don ' t require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond . but we ' ll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . that ' s a problem . okay . did you guys uh get that one down ? um okay , here ' s some ideas for you . a large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . so i ' ll show you some numbers here . um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . um , that would , are willing to pay extra . so i guess we ' re gonna have to figure out what age group we ' re , we ' re targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . and if we have the budget for it . um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it . mm - hmm . so that , that ' s a whole other field of research . i don ' t know if it ' d be , if we ' d still have a remote , or if you ' re talking to your television and saying change channel . um and depending on how many members you have in households . so it m it may be too complicated for us , but it ' s something to keep in mind anyway . right . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . it looks like mm - hmm . it ' d be like the ultimate remote . um okay . and th the last thing here was a , an l_c_d_ screen . so , i mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . not practical . um an l_c_d_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this powerpoint is working . so that you don ' t have so many buttons to deal with . oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . s or like um yeah . or like an alarm clock . you ' d have an l_c_d_ versus just a , a normal clock . oh just like an electronic screen . as opposed to just buttons . there would be like a little , like on yeah . like on the top of a cellphone , the the little l_c_d_ screen . um , now that ' s , i , i dunno exactly what exactly we ' d put on there . i guess the channel that you ' re on , the v the volume setting . mm - hmm . well i guess that ' s something we can all take back to our respective research . um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . um , i think our priority really should be unique design . um , we want something that people want in their home . every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user - friendly and unique . so the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . um , i th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . so if we ' re , if we ' re aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . i mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . but if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics . mm - hmm . right . and we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . i mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah i ' d pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that ' s three months allowance . um , so i i think , i think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . yeah . yep . okay . that ' s it for the market research . yeah . maybe we can do the there you go . oh , come back screen . hmm . it ' s probably r_ r_r_ in yellow . yeah , i think . okay , so i are we going to write off the l_c_d_ option ? yeah ? okay . so no l_c_d_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition . yeah . never heard of it . um , well i guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons . um . and the what was the word they used ? f findability is important . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm . mm . on the buttons ? it doesn ' t it could it could be a tactile thing as well . um right , if w if we ' re minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . and there ' s something on it . s you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume . um , and i don ' t know what we could do for , for channels . s the numbers themselves . but then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing . yeah . i just thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . i ' m not sure . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . i guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you ' re s and then it goes , so if , if you ' re like changing the volume during a movie . i know , i ' m thinking of mostly when you ' re watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . and you don ' t want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there ' s suddenly an explosion , and it ' s gonna wake up the baby . um , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it . it lights up for on self timer . yeah . oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell you know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it ' s touched again . yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . so if you have all the lights off in your living room , you ' ll , you ' ll temporarily see it . because usually you ' re not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . so mm - hmm . mm - hmm . oh right , the mm - hmm . i was gonna say , exactly . it the it might be perceived as tacky , glow - in - the - dark . it ' s kind of like eighties neon - style . um , whereas we ' re trying to be trendy and fashionable . so mm - hmm . mm . that ' s true . what um oh sorry . yeah well , i was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . um , it , you , ' cause you mentioned face plates . so i i dunno if there ' s something that diff , you know like five different face plates . i dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . um yeah , exactly , like an ipod . exactly . or , or like mobile ph . and i dunno if we ' d want to go with like t_v_ show themes or something . like a bart simpson faceplate . but mm - hmm . exactly . you could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . mm - hmm . right . right . okay . yeah . that ' s okay . that ' s okay . okay . okay . um , do i need to plugged in . f_ okay . function f_ eight . sorry about this guys . ' kay . is on . right . okay . i will take this time just to apologise . i , i only , uh , received my emails later on . ' cause i was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not obviously not a very good part of a team - working thing . but there we go . um , so i was looking at how we ' re going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . and it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . they don ' t need to actually manually touch the television set . so , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . um , from uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there ' re certain points that will make our product unique . um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um genevieve ' s idea . so we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . and we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we ' re using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . a automatically , um lights up at first touch . or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . um , also we could use um an alarm . so if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . um , so that would work . um , oop . go back there . um , another thing i think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . um , from previous researches i ' ve carried out on other projects , um we ' ve learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . so they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . so , for example , a screw that ' s holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . so um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . so , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and i think that would be very important for products now . especially ' cause there ' s much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . ' cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious . yeah . um and then yeah . yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape - memory alloy . and that ' s the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . i mean , the user would return the p product to the company , ' cause it ' s the product ' s responsibility to get rid of what they ' ve made . um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape - memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . something like the case , if it ' s scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . you could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . for a certain percentage at least . not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , but yeah . yeah . yeah . well i the fact of the shape - memory alloys is that they , they don ' t need to be manually de um deconstructed . like , you don ' t have to individually um unscrew all the screws . because of this , their properties are smart material . all you need is just the heat , so they self - destruct themselves . so i suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but yeah . okay . um also there is um components . this ' ll be how it uh will actually work . but i haven ' t put this plan together yet . there we go . sorry , should i go back . this would actually show the circuit diagram . although i haven ' t come up with the final circuit yet . so i just put all those components in . yeah . i it just shows what sort of energy source . it could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . um , an ' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . okay ? so , now is it f_ eight again to escape ? or escape ? there we go . okay . thank you . there you go tara . function f_ eight . the one at the top . um , i was just wondering about the , what , what genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . and that would probably , um , i d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . i suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . and limit the design . do you think ? yeah . yeah . that ' s true . yeah . yeah . okay . yeah . mm . yeah . mm . yeah . mm - hmm . mm . the single function . yeah . yeah that ' s a good point . it ' s like the news . or like information . the and what ' s on . it ' s like it ' s like very basic internet . sort of , um yeah , it ' s just information that um , like television timetables , what ' s on , what ' s on now , what ' s on next , on every channel , and yeah . to get the right reception and picture , i suppose . repetitive strain injury . i think . oh , i ' m guessing that ' s what it is . i ' m not mm . yeah . yeah . it is . mm - hmm . mm . yeah . and if there was conversation in the room at the same time , although in theory it doesn ' t tend to be when you ' re watching television , but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design . yeah . mm . yeah . mm . what , what would appear on the screen ? like linked in with the teletext , or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television . mm , yeah . could be . mm - hmm . yeah . mm . yeah . yeah . complicated jus complicating things even fo mm . okay . can i just interrupt ? would you like to plug in your have you got a powerpoint or not ? okay . thanks . were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ? yeah . yeah . okay . yeah . okay . right . yeah . yeah . okay . just okay . work on that . yeah . mm - hmm . okay . yeah . yeah . yeah . i don ' t know . more research required , i think . but if was it a management decision that we ' re having okay . so okay . ' kay . minimal yeah okay . yeah . the same signalling . i mean or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . like you just a , a buzz or something . yeah . if do you mean the the link between the well , if the button was actually on oh , yeah . maybe yeah , yeah . maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive . obviously something small that ' s yeah , that ' s a good point . yeah . yeah , okay . pr probably . unless it could be okay . um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the t_v_ ' s supplied from . i mean the power for the t_v_ . so , mm , more research into that one . yeah . y yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . like a raised yeah that ' s true . and also y , uh heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody . um , so like big b um buttons , for people you are visually impaired . the glow - in - the - dark or light up won ' t make any difference anyway . so like you say tactile might be better , because it ' d be more available to everybody . yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . no , it ' s not these days . i mean , it ' s quite easily accessible . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . so self - timed lighting . um , i yeah . so , self - timed yeah . yeah . i think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . and i think that ' s un unique as well . i mean , i haven ' t seen that . and as you ' re saying like numbers can wear off if they ' re just sort of like painted on , you know printed . durable . oh yeah . yeah . yeah . repetitive strain injury . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah , and we could yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , which could like link in with the company colours . like it could be blue or green or yellow , or like we ' ve just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so yeah . every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well . or , or the , whate yeah . is okay . like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something . yeah , or okay . yeah . person yeah . well , that ' s great . interchangeable . um , als yeah . interchan and also possible i mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain t_v_ shows , or yeah . but if we , there is yeah . we could um , the environmental factor , we didn ' t bring that up again . yeah . um , i ' ve okay . let ' s i think we could probably leave that ' til later on , then . no . okay . thank you . am i starting now ? anytime ? oh sorry . ' kay , um . alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and um i hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . um , and um , i ' ll be taking minutes on this one , and um being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn ' t very necessary for uh myself , because it ' ll be more about uh , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . um , so , the first presentation we ' ll be looking at is poppy ' s presentation . and , um so , sorry ? so , um , take it away poppy . it ' s , it ' s plugged in . so , um no problem . i ' m sure it ' s fine . right , um , one question . this , um , self - destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ? so that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ? yeah . mm - hmm . would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? or would we contribute to another group ? alright . okay . this sounds like a really great idea . one thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . um , so we ' ll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , um ' cause it sounds very labour - intensive . you would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive . mm - hmm . alright . we ' ll still have to investigate the financial implications . alright . i like the environmental approach . um , we ' ll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well . i ' m sorry , could you those were um okay . so those are what , um , we ' ll c construct the remote . those are all the alright . great . alright . thank you very much . and , um , the next presenter will be tara . yeah . function f_ eight . sorry . yeah . right . does everyone agree with this ? does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ? mm - hmm . yeah . alright . sounds great . alright , well , um , are you ready for your presentation genevieve ? fabulous . except you ' re not hooked up to the great . no problem , we can i ' m sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ? mm - hmm . i ' m sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . you mean that they would spend more money on a fancy - looking remote control ? okay . alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . and another thing with um lots of surfing , we ' d probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , because i find with um channel - changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they ' re printed on the button . yeah . it ' s um no it ' s a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up . i haven ' t used it before but mm . that ' s rather sad . yep . i agree with um if we ' re targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . um , financially and and functionally . um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won ' t be as concerned . mm - hmm . yeah . and something that might further complicate it is that the t_v_ makes noise itself . wonder if it would have yeah . yeah . if we ' re looking for a simplistic design , if we need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design . um , because if , if it is then i think voice , um voice - activated yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won ' t be using a , they won ' t be talking into a remote , i ' m sure . um , i don ' t know what an l_c_d_ screen is . i have no idea still . i ' m sorry . oh , on the remote . okay . yeah . right . mm - hmm . yeah . and if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , i ' m sure that something like an l_c_d_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem . yeah . alright . okay . before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like , i ' ve received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . um , for one thing , because having controls with d_v_d_ , v_c_r_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . um , we ' ve decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . which is good as , as we ' ve sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . um , for many reasons . so um we have that decision sort of made for us . another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . and so uh we won ' t concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . yep . okay , sure . yeah i do . i ' m looking at looking at it right now . thank you . um , well , i mean we don ' t have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used . alright , and another thing . this is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . so , um , all the remote controls must have our um we ' ll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . so , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . um , it doesn ' t have to be the colour of our um of our company but , another thing is that , um we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . um , i ' m assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting i , i wasn ' t offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable . the little r_ r_ yellow thing ? okay . real reaction ? okay . um , yes , those are the changes . um , so , now we need to discuss , um and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . i ' m just going to look at my notes for a second . um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . so , um , we already know that it ' ll just be for the television . it ' ll it won ' t have teletext . but um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , genevieve . is that how most people feel about that ? okay . yeah , but another thing is that if we ' re reaching an international crowd , um , i know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext , so it ' d be really superfluous . yeah . i don ' t know about other countries besides the u_k_ . do you know if anywhere else has it ? alright . it was a management decision , so it ' s , it ' s pretty much out of our hands at this point . ' kay . so , i guess we ' re looking at something rather simple . yeah . i think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . ' cause i ' m sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . it ' s not that expensive to do . yeah . yeah . okay . i like that idea . yeah . the button oh . minor detail there . yeah , it would have t mm - hmm . yeah . then it wouldn ' t , it probably wouldn ' t be able to use it would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control i guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . okay . maybe , um probably , i mean . that ' s your department you ' ll have to sort that out . yeah , you ' ll have to yeah , you ' ll have to investi do some research on that , alright ? great . um , alright , and i ' m sure that , um um , the glow - in - the - dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . is everyone interested in that ? yeah . yeah . hmm . yeah . but i mean yeah . yeah . could we somehow we could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow - in - the - dark material . ' cause i d i don ' t think that glow - in - the - dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours . yeah . alright we have five minutes left um , for the meeting , but i think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . um , what was i missed the last moment , reading that . what were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ? yeah . yeah . mm . so it could be any button that would be pressed . yeah . okay , so that ' s probably feasible . so , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow - in - the - dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? do we have to kind of decide what we ' re gonna do with this . yeah , okay . yeah . yeah , yeah . and it could , if it ' s that softer rubber material it ' ll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no what ' s it called , r_s_i_ , what was it that we were talking about ? yeah . yeah instead of like hard buttons . okay . um , did we want to go for the glow - in - the - dark look ? or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? like should we do both ? or we can have one or the other ? because it might , for , for our design purposes , i mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow - in - the - dark material has a funny kinda colour . and it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with . yeah . right . right . alright . so we ' ve decided on lighting up things . yeah . yeah . but with the same thing , i mean . if you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well . is are you okay with that ? okay . cool . um alright . so i think that um that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions . and now it ' s up to designing . and um making sure that this can be feasible . and do you have anything do you have anything to say ? like an ipod or something ? okay . like a cellphone ? yeah . mm - hmm . accessories . yeah . i think that we should incorporate that . ' cause that wouldn ' t be very expensive at all . you ' d just get one mould , throw some plastic in it , you know . yeah . well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues . so , if it takes off then we ' ll , we ' ll , we ' ll try that out . right . we ' ll have to do more research . like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it ' ll look . um , does it need to be reached a de do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? because we need to investigate the financial implications . okay . is it does it need to be uh decided on now ? or should we okay . good . alright then . anyone else have anything more to say before we close ? alright , well . let ' s have lunch and we ' ll discuss this later . alright ?","the project manager opens the meeting , asking the industrial designer to present first . the industrial designer begins talking about the functional aspect of the working design and features to make the product unique , such as visibility in the dark , locator alarm , and environmentally - friendly materials . to make an environmental impact , they could use smart materials that can be heated and cooled so that the individual components easily separate to be reused or recycled . the group asks some questions about this idea and then the interface designer presents about technical functions , explaining the difference between a multifunctional and single function remote . the group discusses the two types and decides that a single function design is more suitable for the budget . the marketing expert presents on user requirements by using research done on remote control users . she summarizes these findings andexplains her personal preference for a user - friendly , unique design since certain features could be too complex . the project manager receives some decision - affecting information from management , which she shares with the group . they have a discussion about the remote control functions and close the meeting .",ES2015b
"yeah . no . what is it ? i think you ' ve got to do um control f_ eight . shift f_ eight . ah there , it ' s doing something . i think it ' s that little right . thank you . mine ' s not quite as complicated as all that . did i press function ? yeah . oh . um . okay so i ' m gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . i ' m louisa , the user interface designer , as you know . um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that . um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . um here are two example remotes . um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so i think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won ' t have to worry about . uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . um whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . um so my personal preference would be the right remote . so , it ' s got nice big buttons , it ' s got a very limited number of buttons . um they ' re nice , kinda clearly labelled . um i like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . so it ' s very very user friendly , and it ' s got a little splash of colour . could maybe do with some more colour . um . hmm . do we get to see that ? will you be presenting that in a bit ? hmm . what do you mean by the circular section ? like all of that bottom bit ? yeah . yeah . and i don ' t really think that you need nine numbers . i mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? i think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . like how often do you hit nine ? hmm . um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , um if that ' s a favourite you just like by - pass two to five . hmm . mm . um . but i think a lot of um like cable and sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you ' d have another remote for all of those channels . like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers yeah . but i suppose nine ' s not really excessive . i suppose it does make a good pattern . okay . um i think that ' s just for a video , so we wouldn ' t need any of that at all . mm - hmm . okay , so is everyone happy with that ? right well that ' s the end of my presentation . do a lot of um there ' s key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at , i can ' t remember , and then they whistle back , or something like that . that ' d probably be really simple , they ' re cheap . yeah . well i think it ' d be really easy and it ' d be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function . ' cause that ' ll solve kind of the frustration of losing it . yeah . i don ' t really know about the voice recognition thing . mm - hmm . yeah . and that wouldn ' t put off the kind of older generation either , ' cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn ' t have to be kind of scared of this new technology . ' kay we ' ve already decided that we don ' t need a teletext button , haven ' t we ? is that one of the hmm . right . yeah , i think so , so zero to nine . hmm . mm . yeah . yeah , like the volume or something . yeah , ' cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . my dad was watching a film the other week and it was too dark , so i had to go through it and turn the brightness up . well , if we ' re trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there ' s kind of um everything else revealed ? so you don ' t use it that much , you don ' t have to see it all the time . but it ' s all there if you need it . like a hidden panel . hmm . and that ' ll be better for the older generation as well ' cause , well my dad doesn ' t like anything that you ' ve got to kinda flick through a menu , but he can pretty much read a button if it ' s displayed properly . yeah . and the volume ? um . yeah . yeah i think they ' re handy . i know it ' s probably like um not an issue to raise here , but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity . have you seen the adverts ? like if you boil the kettle that ' s full that ' s a waste . if you leave your telly on standby it powers blackpool for a certain amount of time . like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby . yeah , it ' s maybe too much of a big issue for here . uh - oh danger sign . yeah , but a little bit smaller . compromise . right . on mute . so . and then mm - hmm . uh there ' s audio functions . yeah . i think they normally do . yeah . so i think um there ' s quite a lot of like dolby surround studio , surround sort of things . um maybe for the younger market . um i think they ' ve got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel . oh no , i mean um like there ' s kind of individual buttons for them , like on the t_v_ remote . but i don ' t really know what they ' re for , i ' ve never used them . i just know they ' re something to do with dolby . right . we have a i guess we have a presentation each , ' cause i ' ve got one . um . mm - hmm . uh we didn ' t , no . i d i didn ' t personally . okay that ' s fine . i ' ll just um i ' ll grab the wire out the back of this one . i ' m not quite sure how it control doesn ' t seem to be quite working at the moment . alt function f_ eight . again not doing anything . oh . pressed about five times now . okay , that ' s me . okay , um i have to go again . hopefully that should be it this time . okay , i think we ' re there . that ' s good . okay , um okay i ' m gonna be looking at the working design . um of the of the remote control . um i ' ve just got three sections , first is the research i made on the on the remote control itself um . and then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote . um so having researched the existing models within the market , um i found my research off the internet . um i ' ve established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . and then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . um the basic components are an energy source which i guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply . whether that ' ll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary . we then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that . um there ' s also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . and then the sender , which um is usually , i ' ve found , an infra - red device which sends a signal to the actual television . um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that ' s obviously found in the television . . um i ' m gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on powerpoint to get this working , so . i ' ll just go through there . s um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ? oh i ' ll j oh i see . oh okay . i ' ll get rid of the bear okay that ' s great . okay , so we start off with a um battery suppl uh no , a power supply which we ' d probably get it ' s probably gonna be the battery . um we then have a particular button , which may be that ' s obviously there ' s lots and lots of different buttons . um but this is how the basic system works . um that sends after you press that that sends the message to the chip , which um then sends it sort of interprets which button you ' ve pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . um . so that ' s . that ' s the remote in itself , that ' s the components of the remote and how they work together . so this is the uh user interface . um this is the chip itself , which then , and that ' s the that ' s the infra - red sender . and then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver . and the sender sends a message to the receiver . ' kay . ah yes , that ' s the power source . um . going on to personal preferences , i ' ve said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . you don ' t want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it ' s not it ' s not really a remote . um and then the sender , and infra - red um has been used quite successfully . if the battery ' s on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well . you don ' t have to be point directly at the television itself . um yes . ' kay and that ' s it for the moment . would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well . so we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . possibly ? j yeah yeah yeah j yeah just this little bit is that i think that ' s still um a video remote part , so maybe we could get rid of that as well . it ' s just people are used to seeing that , so if we didn ' t have them then they might think it ' s hmm . okay , yeah . i suppose with nine you ' ve got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it ' s like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . so with that we ' d kind of by - pass any problems with yeah . yeah . ' cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need . um . so we could get it down to what ? so we get to how many buttons have we got ? we ' ve just got ten , eleven twelve th we got fourteen that we need . i guess . um which isn ' t really too many . that ' ll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote . ' kay . ' kay . ah yes yes , that seems good . i think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up . i ' m sure we ' ll have by the end of today . mm . no what i maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . um . and possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have you know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . so you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . that is true , yes . hmm . so i guess it ' d be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote . yeah . yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device . you could have an option to turn it off . or perhaps , um . so that would solve the problems with the t_v_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . mm . ' kay . yes . has to be simple enough to i suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . um . ' kay . mm - hmm . yes . um . yes that seems right . mm - hmm . okay . maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , and if something comes back i ' d go more yeah , f more for clap . did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . okay , ten numbers and then some kind of device to allow uh i ' ll put delay to allow um multiple numbers . or multiple digits . did we decide anything about um the other functions ? as in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ? you had an had an idea about the menu ? but just thinking um people probably i mean you don ' t have you only have to probably tune in the t_v_ once , but you have to be able to tune it that once . so and if finally the t_v_ breaks , you get a new one , you ' re gonna have to be able to tune it . you can ' t really avoid that . except the new digital markets which do it by themselves . so that ' ll be in yes . yeah . yeah . yeah yeah . yeah . so how would this menu function work ? would you maybe have like one menu button , then you ' d use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . okay . we ' re gonna have the the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it , to guide presu uh i think it ' d be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work . right , okay um . that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so . that is that is a good idea actually . sor sort of a second . okay . uh not quite , but i guess . keep the other buttons but hide them away . so so um we ' re gonna have to have to work out what ' s gonna be on these other functions as as well . so we ' re gonna have like two separate two separate lists , i guess . so sh should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then so on the about the number . um the volume up and down . shall we have a mute button as well ? a mute button as well . yeah . or but then they might not buy it if they haven ' t got one . ' cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change . we can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn ' t leave it on stand - by . i think you probably should . um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? okay , so we ' ll have um so we ' ve got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? is there anything else ? um . maybe if we ' re gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they ' re gonna be . so tuner up and down , i guess . um up tune one way , tune the o i i dunno i dunno possibly . oh yeah and th and a enter button just to select . yeah , okay . um i guess we ' re keeping s it simple . we don ' t really need any other audio funct uh functions because it ' s just volume up , volume down . um . do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , or do you have to do it via the remote ? yeah i suppose if we ' ve got their if they ' ve got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple . oh , okay . right . um . maybe unless something comes up then we should i think well shall we look into that and just get back together . ' kay . right uh . so um . so where ' s the powerpoint presentation ? sorry ? microsoft powerpoint , right . right , okay . so . right . okay , so we ' ve got uh so we ' ve got new project requirements . um . so basically we ' ve got three things , and we ' ve got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options . um . three presentations . i see , right . that ' s nice to know , one from each of you . um new project requirements . um so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to um w i i got um or or three things basically , um relating to the remote being only for t_v_ . we discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway . so in fact it actually f we won ' t be forestalled in a sense . um we ' ve got uh teletext outdated . um did you get any information on that ? right and the corporate image was the uh final thing . so i i got that in email form . um . right okay . so i guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations . so we ' ll start with yourself on the basis that uh sorry , yep . oh . it going ? okay . uh there ' s the rubber on the right , i think . it ' s magic . so the the top bit ' s the power source , yes ? . so the battery is the in the sender . okay . so , now more design . that ' s what we like to hear . is it control function ei oh , th there you go . well there ' s a couple of things there . um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . so basically we ' d have to uh we ' d have to be putting that on um the the product . i haven ' t as yet , no . but uh i got uh i got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . so uh i ' m guessing that uh uh i notice on the bottom there it ' s got uh what ' s that ? a_p_o_g_e_e_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour i can see in that is the red . well b uh w well th the on the well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we ' d have to have some room for uh future such channels . but but but , well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but uh i mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ? i would have thought that uh it ' s forever expanding and at the moment we ' ve got although you ' ve onl you ' ve got the five standard , you ' ve got the b_b_c_ have come up with a further six and uh there ' s uh i don ' t know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh sky and various other um various others . so i would ' ve thought that we wouldn ' t , you know , rather okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it ' ll take a second ' cause you have to be able to stop it . maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise . y you ' d want you ' d want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted . mm - hmm . yeah , i s i suppose in a sense you could have um if you ' ve got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut down your time . anyway . whatever . okay . okay . limit the number of buttons , user friendly . yeah . well that ' s true , yeah , you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , that that makes sense . yeah . does . so w so what was the circular thing that you were if it ' s just for t_v_ , which is what it is at the moment . mm - hmm . well we ' ve we ' ve got um that it ' s remote for t_v_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations . i ' m i don ' t know d did you have that information behind the marketing , or was i meant to give you that information ? right . right , okay , so basically time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery . we ' ve only got about another four hours left . yeah , i think she said twenty seconds to um what was that last wee bit there ? speech recognition , right okay . but that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn ' t . well that ' s right . sounds reasonable . mm - hmm . yeah . so well if you ' re trying to avoid having a second product ' cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here i am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . but if you i know . um i was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever . you ' d want to try and av just have the one product that if yeah . um i dunno um talking about vo i mean obviously if you ' ve got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it ' ll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be . but you ' ve then got the point if if you ' re not going with uh voice recognition then mm . so uh any sugges well , any conclusions ? well if it does then we can ' t . it ' s that simple , because we ' ve got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had the design logo was one , which we ' ve already mentioned . we ' ve got um the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly . and the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned , um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet . so that means that uh so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project . so we ' re being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . so anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical . s it would . but probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras . added extras would be nice , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window , which effectively now is sort of four hours . so and if and we ' ve gotta get to the end . uh d d i think i think first and foremost we ' ve gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible . okay . right okay , uh so i need to right . so i don ' t know how long we have left of our uh time . but we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that ' s got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is . we ' ll also know w when the next meeting is i um so we ' ll know how long we ' ve got to complete that task . and then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes , we ' ve achieved this or we haven ' t achieved this , this is how far we ' ve progressed . does that make reasonable sense ? so we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you ' re gonna be doing . and if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you ' d think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting . do it via the email so that rather than coming you know if you get the information just before the next meeting that ' s fine . come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate . but if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know ' cause that might have an impact on their uh on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting . okay . right , is there i would guess so . yep . i w well uh i something simple . uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time ' s short , you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product , something that ' s quick and simple . so , sounds good . well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be on the basis that if we ' ve got if we ' re catering to the whole age range , you want something that ' s easy to do , now something that doesn ' t like whis uh well i i i don ' t know . well if you think that more people can whistle than clap then that ' s fine , then go for that option , but if i would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , so uh so clap option . okay . uh . ef effectively that ' s what the that ' s what they ' re saying , that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don ' t need teletext , so so take out teletext . yeah . no . but the but that ' s relying on the television market changing to an automatic and if it is at the moment , that ' s fine . but at the moment it ' s not , so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , ' cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market which is and it ' s also m it ' s the the product we ' ve got is something that ' s at the i would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , so we ' re not really going for something that ' s uh terribly high - tech . possibly . that ' s right . okay , well . mm . so y ah that ' s a very good idea . so you keep um right we ' ve got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so i ' ve been told . i don ' t know if you ' ve got the same . okay . so so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back . ah . mm - hmm . that ' s right . data functions hidden at back . can bring out when needed . that ' s right so we ' re dis so you ' ve got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back . we have to decide . i guess so . so on front , numbers , volume . sorry ? mm . mm - hmm . so so are you having the stand - by on the front , then ? well . channel up and down . what else have we got ? what was that , sixteen ? volume button . how many volumes ? right okay . power button , stand - by , channel , up and down . so is that it ? okay . that ' s sixteen buttons , you reckon . and then at the back ? okay . so on the back it ' ll have brightness , contrast , anything else ? you ' re also gonna have the channel tuner , as it were . tuner , would that have up and down ? . okay . okay . um up volume , yeah , i would have thought so . okay . yeah . yeah . well you might get some research . okay . right so i ' ll do the minutes of uh this meeting . and we ' ll meet back at i ' m not sure . um forty minutes , i believe is the time . come on . yeah , i ' ve got one too . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . hmm . there ' s usually a little thing in the top right for the oh hang on , it ' s just coming on . okay . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . um i ' m not sure . i had i ' ve had some market information , but not from the company , no . okay . ' kay . i ' m gonna pull this off . uh - huh . okay . i ' ll give it another go . yeah , there we go . right , we ' ve done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . and first off we should state that th the remote control ' s for controlling the t_v_ and um how do people use it ? we asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control . and we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we ' d prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . and three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control and that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren ' t used very often at all . people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . and young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people weren ' t quite so keen on speech recognition . there ' s a lot more th there ' s a lot lot more older people who didn ' t know whether they wanted it or not as well . um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn ' t find it . and the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . okay , so my personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high - tech a design which looks high - tech , basically . um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as louisa said . um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an l_c_d_ menu for other functions on the remote control . that ' s worth thinking about . um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high - tech design . that that might be the market that we ' re we ' re looking for . and we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it ' s lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels . ' cause there ' s a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . okay um , and that ' s the end of the slide show . that ' s it . cool . um about speech recognition ? yeah . youn young people pref yeah , they s they said that they ' d be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . uh - huh . yeah . yeah , we ' d have t that would mean we ' d have to put two products together as well , which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? considering yeah . mm - hmm . okay . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . so about five minutes . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . okay , yeah . mm - hmm . okay . yep . yeah . mm - hmm . so do we need to decide on the functions now ? s mm - hmm . yeah and yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so . i don ' t think there ' s anything else on the market that does that , so . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . no not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? no , clapping , i think clapping , yeah . yeah . yeah . taking out teletext , okay . mm . i think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , so you can press any two and it ' ll sort of put them together . yeah . yeah . yeah . uh we could possibly put an l_ a sort of a l_c_d_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . yeah . i s i suppose um if people are buying remotes , then they ' re probably buying it to replace another remote ' cause all most tellies come with remotes , so . i mean we ' re maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . yeah , that would be a good idea , yeah . mm - hmm . hmm . uh i ' m not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet ' cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . so maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , so you ' re basically pressing right . okay . yeah . yeah , yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . yeah . so th the the detailed ones would be sort of brightness , uh sorta mm - hmm . yeah . mm - hmm . and probably a power one as well . dunno . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . yeah . okay . um ' cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . um . numbers is ten , volume is twelve , th yeah si one up , one down . and a mute , yeah . that ' s sixteen isn ' t it , yeah . i don ' t think so , no . you ' ve got brightness and contrast . yeah . yeah . yeah . and then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . so you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah . yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . okay . right . okay .","the project manager gave the group new requirements on product features . the industrial designer gave a presentation on the working design of the device . he presented all the necessary internal components and how they operate together . he gave his preferences on energy sources and senders . the user interface designer presented the necessary functions of the remote , then compared the interfaces of two existing remotes . the group discussed making their remote more user - friendly ; they proposed eliminating rarely - used buttons and making it easier to skip through channels . the marketing expert discussed user requirements with the group and showed that users wanted a fancier , less complicated remote that would not be easily lost . he suggested incorporating a menu and an lcd screen to satisfy these requirements . the group discussed how to incorporate a locator function . the project manager reminded the group to limit the number of complicated features due to the project ' s time constraints . the group had a discussion to decide on product features . they decided to include a clapping locator function and a device that allows the user to enter two numbers separately to get a two - digit number . complicated functions will be hidden in a back panel .",ES2014b
"i ' m sorry . what was the where ' s the l_e_d_ ? oh . okay . oh , there ' s no e okay . okay . sixty . well the there is a there ' s a delay on remotes i think . where you can have it it ' s like a five second input time . so as long as you hit them dada it should be fine . as long as there ' s not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . was there so on the top there is volume and channel up volume up . okay cool . yeah . it ' s the r_ . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yes . oh it ' s nice . oh i think i killed the five . i did . i killed the four . oh god . oh it smells good . bravo you want the i don ' t know what order it goes in . i have one . evaluation cri okay . that ' s me . hello . oh there we go . okay . come on my computer . come on . sorry my computer ' s giving me technical difficulties . should i press it again ? last time i did that it sh okay . you ' re right . oh . still not there . okay now i think for this one i could would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe i ' ll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it . um , we ' re gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we ' ve just seen . um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um i made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick - off meeting this morning . um , and we ' ll evaluate as to whether we ' ve s done what we set out to do . um and we ' re gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . so basically the lower p the lower the points the better . okay so question number one . does the remote whoops . sorry . oh i ' m not gonna be able um , i ' ll do it on the whiteboard . i can ' t change it so i ' m g i ' m gonna ask you to push it down once . i ' ll write down our scores up on the okay so number one . do we have a fancy look - and - feel ? yeah i guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it ' s definitely different . it ' s not your traditional yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . i kinda i like the potato look . it ' s very different . it ' s what ? oh sorry the mango the mango look . yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . so i myself would say a one or a two . it ' s a two ? okay , and p one being true . so two . okay , actu that ' s pro that ' s gonna get confusing , like that . okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ? so i know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . use of the rubber , the use of the l_e_d_ . isn ' t mm - hmm . yeah . and i think i mean it it ' s tough to say because we were we didn ' t want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would ' ve defeated the purpose . so i mean i we ' ll put three , but i think we actually reached our goal . we didn ' t want it any more than that . okay question number three . uh , will it be easy to use ? yeah . yeah . s yeah i think it ' s you can ' t really get confused with that . i mean , there ' ll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system . but once that ' s figured out , it should be fine . number four . is this a good - looking remote ? remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . mm - hmm . whoops . should just not touch it . this time it ' s the three i killed . i was just wondering if it should be like flatter . or well yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . oh . that ' s true . maybe , it could it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn ' t loo like if it ' s flat here , so it sits up . like that . i g if it ' s weighted maybe . details , details . okay . so , is this a good - looking remote ? would we wanna show it off to our friends ? yeah . yeah ? i mean i gue yeah , it ' s personal taste , but yeah . okay , so should we say two for that ? yeah ? okay . uh , question number five . what ' s um will people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product ? remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . mm - hmm . yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it . shake it and the buttons fall off . no , i guess , i don ' t know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , but i know i am , aren ' t i ? but you don ' t have to buy batteries . so in the long term this can actually save you money . so we ' ll market it that way too . so yeah i think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it ' ll yeah . okay number six . can someone read it out ? or um yeah . so that was mainly that the statistics we said mm - hmm . yeah i guess the i think the key word there is average , ' cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . but they ' re not you and i really . so . okay so one ? okay . number seven . c heather could you push it down ? will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented ? it turns into a duck and starts quacking . here i am . um okay . we oh you ' re just explaining why it ' s not on the prototype . but yeah , it ' ll be there . so we can we could say that we can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . okay . um question number eight . will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . so it has to be yeah , it ' s eas they ' ll pick it up and they ' ll know what to do . the plus thing needs to be worked on . yeah . well do does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? so then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . you could just press six enter , or one two enter . yeah . um , okay so we can we ' ll say yes it ' s uh one ? okay . question number nine . uh , will it minimise the effects of r_s_i_ , which was repeated strain injury ? um , which affected over a quarter of users . s it ' s soft , and and people could mm - hmm . i don ' t know what other options there are . could i mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . but there ' s not really any other options unless it ' s like a keyboard . so , i think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . so , one or two do you think ? two okay . okay number ten . did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? now is the colour gonna be there even if it ' s like vanilla ? is the yellow mm - hmm . it sounds like the colour ' s something that we but i mean the yell yeah d yellow ' s ugly though , depending on the so i think we ' ll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the r_r_ . okay . yeah . and the buttons in the middle . okay . so , do you think that ' s more of a three then ? three , four ? four ? well we have good reasons for it , so we but we can still put a a four ? okay , and final question . um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . yeah . no , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? i think i missed a few they are ? so you can have banana and kiwi and okay . okay , so that ' s something that ' s kind of in the making too , like maybe it ' ll become more mm - hmm . yes we do . so i wh what was i gonna put for that ? a two for fashion ? okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven is between okay . um . yeah , that ' s very good ' cause the highest we coulda got is one . does that seem right then ? okay . sorry . are you gonna do that ? okay . oh is it locked ' cause i ' m in it ? or okay . mm . ' s good . mm - hmm . yeah and the conceptual and functional . like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea i guess , but m when we can down to it . okay . mm - hmm . yeah . good leadership , i think we stayed on task . mm - hmm . and the timing was good . we never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so was good teamwork . i think we are well - suited to our roles . oh really ? okay . yeah . the computer programmes are good . the yeah . i don ' t think there was anything yeah . they ' ll probably still be there . um i ' m not sure , new ideas found . yeah well i guess we really it we bounced off of each other , which was cool . like based on marketing stuff and then you ' d say something about interface and yeah , worked well . mm - hmm . oh does it have smart materials by the way ? does it have smart materials ? oh yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . by watching t_v_ ? mm . conclusion ? dadada . okay . um yeah . i just got a few slides , so show them . thank you . do you want to present it ? yeah , here we are . mango shape . the l_e_d_ . so it ' s palm - held . yeah . you just need the nought . so one plus one would be eleven , or yeah because if you on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you ' d just go to channel two , instead of twelve . so if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . oh . well i don ' t mind , we can further define that . i wouldn ' t have thought it ' d be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . but i suppose it ' s not as snappy . yeah . yeah . if you don ' t put it yeah . yeah , that yeah . mm - hmm . um and channel , which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like it ' s the bigger r_ . so it ' s just like . we deci yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that ' s kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . uh e ergonomics are all considered . yeah . it could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . but yeah , no i mean it ' s a different movement so yeah . um and the feel of it , i mean , we ' ve made this out of play doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . um ' cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti - r_s_i_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , and it just feels feels different . would you like to feel it yourselves ? how it fits in the palm of your hand ? thanks . and you ? o okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . but we ' re thinking that , seeing as we ' re having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . or the combination . um and we ' re thinking to carry - on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . banana ' s more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black . so that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . i mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the yeah , seasonal . apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki yeah . okay . um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , i mean you don ' t need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb . um , as we said the rubber ' s probably used for comfort and anti - r_s_i_ and that ' s about it . mm - hmm . mm go feel i think . we ' ve been quite successful with the rubber coating and yeah . i think the colour has a lot to do with it . i mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren ' t the colours that i think we would ' ve necessarily chosen . it ' s not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek red , black and yellow , and orange . um but if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic - y finish or something well i know know it ' s for rubber . i mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours i think it would look quite fancy . oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . potato ' s fine . potato ' s fine . yeah . totally . it ' s really adaptable . for the fancy i uh two , three . yeah and the use of the rubber . for the anti - r_s_i_ . the l_e_d_ use isn ' t particularly innovative and we don ' t have any scroll buttons , it ' s all pushbuttons , there ' s no l_c_d_ control , so if we ' re thinking about the rest of the market , it ' s sort of probably halfway . in some aspects it is , like we said . yeah . though it was our specification . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah and perhaps the turning on but mm . again i think the colour comes into this . okay . not in don ' t worry . i suppose i ' ve got quite big hands . thing is like that , it ' s not going anywhere particularly . yeah . uh yeah , it ' s less um , what ' s th ha . h it ' s got higher centre of gravity like that . i would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , i ' m not happy with those colours . yeah . yeah . yeah . and the kinetic energy , shaker - style - y , whoo , ooh no . but you know , those ' ll be firmly on . mm , yeah , that ' s true . yeah . good point . yeah . yeah . does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . yeah . because yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel - changing . and it ' s just you won ' t have to think about it . you don ' t have to look down to find them . they ' re clearly there , easy to use . simple . yeah . mm . yeah . it yeah l lights on and , or flash as well . but i mean it ' s not obviously obvious from the outside that that ' s gonna happen ' cause you can ' t s particularly see an alarm . yeah . but when the alarm ' s not yeah . if you yeah . you could s yeah . well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , i mean , when it when it lights up as we i mean it could light up when the alarm went . but if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn ' t be any point . so you can ' t see the alarm , but it would light up . yeah . alarm , but you can ' t see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself . yeah . yeah . it w yeah . sorry . yeah . sorry heather . that wasn ' t very clear . yeah i think just because it ' s we ' ve decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , i think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . mm . and or sixty six enter , y yeah i think that ' s probably more straightforward . yeah . good ooh . mm . oh . injury . yeah , that ' s what i was thinking . we may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don ' t know about . mm - hmm . mm . yeah . i think we ' re getting that ' s true . mm . i think yeah , i think too . yeah . mm . yeah . i think this is the the factor that we ' ve been least successful in confronting . yeah . four i think . well i don ' t what do what okay . yeah . like um the colour scheme names and stuff . yeah . yeah . yeah . it is . the thing is , i think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , i don ' t know if you ' d instantly say mango . oh yeah . there we go . that would be great . um okay . it ' s between one and two . so that ' s pretty fantastic . mm . it seems like it should be more around two . do we have an online calculator ? okay . oh wow . well done . well that ' s excellent . production costs . it says it i think it just means that we can ' t add any more to it now . have you have you completed it ? oh right . okay . okay . yeah . yeah . yeah . double double - curved yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . oof . congratulations guys . of the actual project rather than the product ? a project ? is is yeah . so wh how we actually went round uh about doing it . i think we were pushed . i mean we weren ' t really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . so i think we could ' ve done with a bit more time . yeah . yeah . yeah . well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the l_c_d_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn ' t have been able to afford that . so that did limit creativity . just resources . but yeah . the fruit and veg idea . yeah we did . we ' ve , uh seeing as we ' ve come out with what we intended . a pro um a product within the budget . i think that ' s a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way , so you know i think it ' s been fine . yeah . good timing . and project manager of course . yeah . yeah . um yeah and more play doh , ' cause that was all the red we had . so even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype , we wouldn ' t have been able to . yeah . it could be really straightforward for the computer . i think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays but i think i was the only one who struggled with that . mm . uh me too . yeah . well i think we ' ve all learnt stuff from each other , like the n um yeah . just about each different . got new ideas from each other . yeah . yeah . sorry ? oh yeah . well mm , did it come into the into i dunno if we counted that in the costs . yes . uh . fantastic . okay , brilliant . thank you very much . okay . here we go . alright , the agenda for thi oh . alright . um the agenda for this meeting is um we ' ll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . and um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . i have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we ' ve made , given our options . and um evaluate the product , as a group . and um so first we ' ll have the prototype presentation . do you need the um powerpoint for this ? alright . on ? a mango . okay . oh . okay . oops . yeah . notice you have a number ten button . okay . no problem . ah . oh . you press a plus button ? oh okay . i ' ve never heard of that kind before . yeah . yeah . oh . i but would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? yeah but i mean if you press , it ' ll go to that channel right away . ' cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . yeah i know , but if if i wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if i press the six it ' ll go to channel six , and then i ' ll press the plus , and then it ' ll go to six and then put the five and it ' ll go to sixty five ? i th um yeah it wouldn ' t be a problem . but i was just wondering like as long as we realise that ' s what it ' ll do . yeah . c_ and v_ . right , where um where ' s the power button ? oh okay . yeah . yeah . oh okay . yeah . ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . the spon yeah . yeah . bit of a stress ball feel . yes . i would . my goodness . there you go . genevieve ? yeah . and something hmm . oh right . yeah . it looks more think like vanilla and banana would . okay yeah . kinda christmas , you know . yeah . cool . alright , thank you very much . good work everyone . alright . and so now that we ' ve we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . so , i have something i ' m going to oh wait a minute . do you need to do a presentation first ? yeah . i ' m gonna check that out for a second . what time is it anyw oh yeah sorry you ' re right . evaluation criteria is next in line . yeah . just press um function eight again . and then again i think . one more time . yeah . yeah . okay . ooh . yeah . the look is a little bit more playful . oh definitely different yeah . oh you were only given red and black ? oh okay . yeah . okay . yeah . yeah . it ' s mango . it ' s mango . yeah . i would say two . personally . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . i ' d say maybe three . yeah we want it simple . yeah . i think so . yeah . yeah . one . th the plus number thing . yeah colour will definitely be a factor . i think that the logo could be smaller . and maybe not such a prominent way . maybe like at the bottom , kind of . oh it just had to be on there i guess . i like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like round . it would still be comfortable i think . we c we could handle it i think . ah it ' d fall over all the time though . it ' d be annoying . ' kay we ' re done designing . come on . i think , it was another colour and it was like i think it ' d look okay . i think maybe a two . sure . yeah . yeah . durable . but you ' re our marketing expert . oh . exactly . exactly . yeah . i would give it a two still though . mm . oh yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . we have the alarm system . i thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . or or was it gonna make a noise ? you press the button it makes a noise right ? yeah . awesome . awesome . i though w it was gonna make a noise . okay . oh okay . whoo . okay . yeah , totally . no problem , mm . totally . yeah . yeah , so it ' s just like channel six , six , enter . yeah but you don ' t have to press zeros . and then like twelve , enter . yeah . yeah . i think so . it ' s like right in the your thumb might get a little bit uh yeah . but it is soft . and that ' s kind of what the um the powerpoint slide thing said would be good for r_s_i_ , so maybe it is but yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yes we did . well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . so it could be grey on the banana one . yeah . mm , yeah . hum . i would say so . but maybe more like two ' cause there ' s no like pictures of fruit , it ' s just sort of naming it by a fruit . with the with the colours . yeah . yeah . that ' s fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates . be like yeah . maybe if it was scented . yeah we have money for that . um alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ? oh . i would say two . one point nine or something ? i don ' t know these things . um , between one and two . alright . yeah . i ' m attempting to do that right now . yeah it is one point nine . ooh . go heather pauls . yeah . alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget . and um my computer ' s frozen . and now it ' s not . okay . so um in our shared folder , if everyone could go there right now , um i ' m going to um steal a cable . um it ' s it ' s um it ' s an excel file . oh . yeah . ' kay there we go . um , production costs . and um i have to access that as well . one moment . ' kay so far i ' ve added what i think or what is going on ? great . it ' s blinking at me . it ' s locked for editing . read only . i ' m gonna open up a second one then ' cause it ' s locked for editing . i have the original in my um my email account . i dunno . no . no , i was hoping that you guys could . um , there we go . okay here we go . so we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . so um if you can look up at the screen , um the large screen , oh i guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . okay we ' re using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three euros . um we ' re using a regular chip . um , it ' s cur it ' s double curved , so its curved all around . that ' s another three . we ' re already at five . um , we ' re using plastic and rubber , so good thing plastic is free , we ' re at eight . um s yeah . i guess we should do it just for one kind . so it ' s like special colour well we ' ll have two colours right ? well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . so we can um , we have push button interface , so that ' s inexpensive . and um we have a special colour for the button , and we also have a special form . and a special material . which puts us just barely under budget . hurray . yeah . good work guys . so um our operating cost is twelve twenty euros . awesome . and back to our powerpoint . so we ' ve ' kay . yes we are . so we need to do a product evaluation , again , which is probably um i dunno . a different extension of a hmm . yeah ' cause we ' re talking about leadership , teamwork . yeah . alright so um do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ? pushed for creativity ? ye okay . so it ' d be like need more time and materials . but you were allowed m creativity ? i think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ right . right okay great . leadership ? is this me being like , guys do you like me ? um . yeah . yeah . oop okay . teamwork ? i think we worked great as a team . yeah ? alright how were our means ? we needed more play doh colours . yeah . but ever everything else was satisfactory ? is that good yeah ? new ideas found . i don ' t really know what that means . hmm ? yeah . yeah . yeah . each other ' s mm . okay ? well with that achieved , our last slide is our closing slide . yes our costs are within budget . it ' s evaluated generally positively . and um don ' t forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . then we celebrate in such a way that i have no idea . alright ? okay , bye . um this is what we came up with . it ' s a pretty simple design . it ' s um based on a mango ? yeah . and we yeah . and we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here and this ' ll be the power point , the on off button kind yeah . it ' s in the middle of one of the little r_s . and then the other one is the power . and uh we just have a simple design . we wanted it all to be accessible from your thumb yeah palm - held and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb . so you don ' t have to oh that was a mistake , wasn ' t it ? right no , that ' s a zero . take that one off . sorry . i was in charge of the numbers . and this is just if you ' ve got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . you can go one , three or something . you press that first and then you go one three yeah . well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and so the plus and then yeah . no no , th all that ' s why we have all these numbers . these numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine . yeah . oh no . uh , the plus is only for if you ' re going past the number nine . you p oh . no you press the plus first . i i well it doesn ' t we haven ' t really s i would ' ve thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , but she says plus press which what do you think is simpler ? it ' s a yeah . yeah . oops . yeah . yeah . yeah . so a channel . just so we can flick it ' s in the middle of one of the little r_s . yeah , so it ' s all accessible . without m taking your hand off the remote . and it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . okay . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . of play doh yeah . ' cause it ' d be quite subtle and yeah . yeah , yeah , yeah . the pomegranate ' s kinda girly and funky kind of , and then the vanilla ' s more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor . yeah . mm . well yeah . yeah . yeah so not very sleek and we don ' t wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . so we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . yeah . a metallic - y finish we were thinking . polished . okay yeah . we we were we were thinking about yeah . i w i ' d say two i think . fanciness . yeah . yeah . mm . i ' ll go for three as well . no . wouldn ' t be simple , yeah . yeah . yeah very . i think one for that . yeah . no . yeah that ' s the only thing yeah . it ' s definitely yeah . but the remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . yeah . yeah . but you know what i ' ve just thought of there now . what where ' s it gonna sit in your living room ? is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? yeah . but then it wouldn ' t sit as comfortably in your hand . yeah . oh that would be nice . yeah . three . you would though , ' cause it ' s bit it ' s more interesting than other remotes . yeah . yeah . i think we have to market it in the right way , that um to say that it is simplistic . so people don ' t just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , i don ' t want to spend twenty five euros . we have to market it . and the kinetic energy part . yeah . don ' t shake oh no the plus . you ' re use the zero . make a new one . i think they ' re about ten po ten pound , aren ' t they ? about ten pounds . fifteen ? yeah . mm . yeah . i think it does very well . the zap yeah . uh yeah . yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it ' ll vibra it ' ll be again in the marketing . yeah . the light it will . but but both yeah . oh , that would be brilliant . i ' d be tempted to yeah . it would have to be in the market yeah but you still couldn ' t see it . it would just be a little speaker on the back or something . so the plu the plus w once that ' s written down on the page that ' ll be really simple , won ' t it ? yeah . that kind of annoys me though , when it ' s zero six when you have to press i don ' t know why . oh okay . right . alright , aye . yeah . i ' d say w yeah one . yeah . yeah . hmm . but if you ' re zapping yeah . i don ' t think it will f yeah , the biology . mm . yeah . yeah . i i ' d say t two . yeah . yeah . n we we can ' t really do that because for example on the banana theme we can ' t have it as being yellow . it won ' t stand out . so n it ' s not always gonna be the same colour . gray , yeah . yeah , could be grey . yeah that ' s right , we didn ' t even rea yeah . perhaps a metallic or or like that ' s grey , and it wouldn ' t be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . no ? that isn ' t rubber . okay . following that briefing we did . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . i think w yeah , i think one . well that was our brief and we followed the brief . well we haven ' t got a big banana but oh yeah . no . no . oh that would be class . yeah . two . it ' s yeah . close to two . yeah . i got yeah , ' cause we ' ve a four to bring down . uh , aye . yeah . uh , should ' ve added five . this is . yay . is that the project document ? yeah . oh right . what about a special colour ? are we using that ? yeah . and a special material . yeah . that ' s good . yeah . the ma or materials . yeah . yeah . yeah . creativity . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah , it c it might ' ve been bigger . yeah . i ' m actually not sure if i ' ve saved my presentations . yeah . through discussion . yeah . and we were a able to modify each other ' s ideas to fit in with our areas of expertise . if if it if it if it can be afforded . yeah . yay . yeah .","the project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda . the designers give the prototype presentation , showing their simple design that is based on a mango . they point out the company logo and led , and demonstrate how the device is palm - held and thumb - acessible . they also discuss the numerical , volume , channel , and power buttons as well as the color scheme . the marketing expert administers the product evaluation , and they rate each of the ten criteria on a scale of 1 - 7 . the criteria includes fancy look - and - feel , technological innovation , ease of use , look , whether people would be willing to spend 25 euros for it , whether its operating behavior matches the average user , ease of finding when lost , ease of learning to use , whether it will minimize rsi , incorporation of company colors and logo , and whether it follows the motto . they average the scores and get 1 . 9 . they check the product costing and find that their operating cost is 12 . 20 euros . in evaluating the project process they are pleased with their creativity , leadership , timing , teamwork , discussions , and overall product given the resources they had . they close the meeting by thanking one another .",ES2015d
". yep . okay . yep . can i have your cable please ? thanks . okay so i was looking at trend - watching . um unfortunately i wasn ' t given too much information . i was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . and then i ' ll just tell you some personal preferences that i got from that . um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look - and - feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look - and - feel design , which i think we ' ve kind of already discussed before . um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . and again these are all things we ' ve kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . and thirdly the remote would be easy to use . as far as fashion update , we ' ve learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . so that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . okay so from that um , as we ' ve already said , we need to focus on a fancy look - and - feel . um i think we ' ve already discovered that it ' s kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . but i think that , even if it ' s very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they ' re getting something that ' s new and modern and sleek and whether it ' s through the shape or the colours or all of that . um for technologically innovative , we ' ve talked about the tracking device . we brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . and manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . we need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which i think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . i don ' t know , i mean i guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . yeah . yeah . right . or with exterior designs . but my question is , i mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and i ' m not sure how they ' d feel about having fruity logos on the outside . so maybe we could have something that ' s somewhat removable , or i don ' t know , different options for female , male target groups . and then the spongy feel . i guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that ' s out there . c and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy - feeling remote controls . so that ' s that . that ' s what i was thinking yeah . yeah . so when you buy your remote you can buy various coverings . personalise your remote . mm - hmm . dunno . spongy ? y probably not yeah . mm . no . hmm . mm . like a covering . yeah . the we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it . mm . mm . bright citrus colours yeah . oh yeah . yellow and grey . i think having a shape could be a little ridiculous , like well we kinda do yeah . and if it ' s yellow ? grey buttons yeah . mm . oh . nice . could look like a fruit bowl . ' kay . so is the two piece idea out ? or have we not decided ? oh right okay . mm . mm . mm . mm . well what about what you said , like putting the finger grips just on top of the plastic ? yeah . so then for the scroll , are we going for the ipod type ? yeah ? okay . alright . that ' s industrial design for cranes , stuff like that . makes sense , makes sense . uh well let ' s see . i ' m going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . i ' ve more information on possible materials um as well . what we can and cannot do . um but let ' s just wait for this to load up and i ' ll show you what we ' re talking about here . okay . the details of the components ' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . the underside , that ' s pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it ' s getting and will do what you tell it . um so much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . when you press a key um you complete a specific connection . the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . it produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . right . pretty clear . transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light . the sensor in the t_v_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . this is the circuit board from the other side . um the lower part of it , i don ' t know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . um you can see the circuit board itself . that ' s the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . um what you do is you have , don ' t have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . these are the actual keys that are being pressed . they close the electric circuit . that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . that would be behind here . um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . um the way it works is that you have the keys here . the rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . and thus gives on the signal . now this is the simple version . um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . we are talking something more complicated of course , it ' s going to be more expensive as well . and not only that . um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . um i ' ve gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as well . um rubber that is used in these anti - stress balls . so it ' s pretty squishy . that would that would serve that purpose . um we could also use wood , or titanium . oh fya i don ' t have an information on that . however our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so i assume , i ' m , i was given an okay to use it . it certainly is an expensive material , i ' m aware of that , but i was given an okay . but there are certain restrictions to certain materials . now let ' s first go through the list with the materials . so we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . can also mix these . um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . um what we could use is , or what i was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . right ? uh a dynamo . interestingly enough . um we could use solar cells . or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . such as like watches you know . where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . so um obviously i personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . you don ' t wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right ? um solar cell is interesting . may fail though , every here and there . mm . yeah . or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week and yeah mm . always the you but exactly . um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . so i ' d say what we ' re stuck with really is um the basic battery . which also makes a base station basically obsolete . we don ' t need that then . um however our interface options are push - buttons . in which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . um however we ' ve discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . and they are possible . we have an okay for scroll wheels . okay . um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod i ' ve one big objection and that is that we have to fit an l_c_d_ into the remote control as well . this however may exclude certain um materials . if you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an l_c_d_ screen may be affected by the movement . hence we might not be able to put it in there . so um there ' s also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . if we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set - up that we that i ' ve just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . i don ' t have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . i ' d rather say drop the titanium and therefore let ' s have a more sophisticated chip , but that ' s not up to me to decide really . so that ' s for the for the scroll wheel . um it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so i ' d say rather not go for for that . let ' s see now . um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . but obviously that ' s not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , i assume right ? or is anybody still alright . alright . uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional i assume . um um with the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . we would just be able to make it flat and and um yeah a straight design pretty much . which i assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions . you can have an l_c_d_ screen . um but therefore no rubber will be used . alright ? so plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . with plastic , as i understand it , you can use any form . um latex is tricky . or rubber and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . so the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an l_c_d_ screen , and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . or wood even . um if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . add an l_c_d_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that ' ll be fine . or make it just push - buttons . basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . maybe not the nicest feel . or not much originality really . with rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an l_c_d_ screen . that ' s the tricky thing . s certainly can be done yes . um yeah . if that doesn ' t affect the functional side of it all . like say just the underside or so then it can be done . i assume . yeah . so the fruit design um how about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? say we don ' t make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , but uh give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever . you name it . just design - wise . mm . nice one . mm . well we we ' re supposed to stick to the company colours though , that ' s yellow and grey . so what have we , lemon , banana , is grapefruit is what we ' d go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . but mm . well we have it banana - shaped already , kind of . so right . i it ' s yellow . well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ? there you go . it could be an ape . yeah . that ' s pretty much it . i informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go . sure . hang on . there you go . well we can still design a two - piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . we can still do that . however of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . so um which then , as i understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an l_c_d_ screen and so on so on . you ' d probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there . but could be done , of course . right . okay when it comes to the chip - on - print , as i said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip - on - print is gonna be a cheap one . right ? yeah . as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . . m more of a l lamination perhaps . yes . it does . right . right . yep . oh it was sort of banana shaped . those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones . what ' s it called ? cust you personalised , yeah . yeah . okay . why can ' t i see the crazy . um yeah i talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . um so i ' ve looked at some of the stuff i was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . but keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . um i was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . they gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . um okay . there ' s different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . um there ' s a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . a command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . um and then it ju that ' s just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . you can ' t really see that picture well , but there ' s various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated . so , then i had a look at new products that are on the market . not necessarily remote controls but ones that you ' ll recognise . um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . i have a there is a picture . you surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , t_v_ , cable , satellite , v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ and audio . and you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . so the technology is there . um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . you can sort of just make those out . and then on the right is obviously an ipod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . that is a possibility . and nothing ' s simpler really . um then there ' s things like this , which is a a a kid ' s remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . so the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . and um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . so i don ' t know if there ' s a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a v_ for volume . just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . um i think , d carrying on from what i ' ve already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . maybe we ' ve so suggested this two - part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . and then just have the simple sort of hand - held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . um i don ' t it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an ipod where you just sort of control through the menus . stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . and then the the hand - held bit should be ergonomically designed . and that is it . why am i oh yeah . just . where are we ? uh . just to sort of show you . m they ' ve even got things like that . huge things . which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ? yeah . yeah . and that yeah . yeah . see . things . . why ' s my screen crazy ? mm . would you have to leave it by the window ? yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . so i don ' t know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic . but then where do people hold it ? just all be sort of spongy . so you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? like the ipod ? right . yeah . yeah . could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is uh sort of banana - esque . so that ' s thing if we did it yellow . and um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . they wouldn ' t have any they ' re just on the exterior . they wouldn ' t be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . yeah . mm . you could just sell it in different colours as well i suppose . in different ye yellows . i don ' t suppose we have to stick to co stick to the colours yeah . mm grapefruit . yeah . . yeah . yeah . yeah . and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour . yeah . on the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey . yeah . it could and then you could actually h put the banana - shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was . yeah . yeah . well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery . and the base station might not be necessary . yeah . yeah . just just maybe yeah . just a little bit of . yeah . yeah . yeah i think so . i think okay . right . okay . alright . is everyone here ? okay . this is our conceptual design meeting . and i ' ll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we ' ll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . um i ' ll go through the mee through the minutes first . um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . um and our marketing expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . people thought their remotes were ugly , um um that remotes zap a lot . um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons . um and that they often lose the it ' s easy to lose a remote . um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple . um and uh some sort of locator . either a button or tracking device . um and that it should look different than what ' s out there . um kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . the younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . um uh i think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers ' nerves . um then the user interface designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . um the simple versus the um the complex . the simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . um um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user - oriented remote , something simple . um and that we didn ' t wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . um we would just have a t_v_ remote . um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . have it s be something that looks different . and finally our um industrial designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . um from energy source , um uh what we would use . batteries because we don ' t wanna have a a cable . um how that would power the remote and the lamp . if we were to to have one . uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the t_v_ . um i believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . um um something that will fit into uh easily into someone ' s hand . and with a , just a few buttons . just the basics . and with a scrolling um function also . okay and i will leave that , leave it at that . so marketing ? we ' re watching trends . i suppose that you can have this . a banana shape ? so possibly like a uh , sorry , just to butt in for a second . possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? you have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that ' s a spongy feel to it . you can mm various covers . we could leave that to the cover department . we all know they ' ve got nothing to do all day . notice the giant dog bone shape ? also good for animals . what ' s the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ? works well in arizona but in edinburgh not so no i think i think batteries are probably the way to go . yeah . so the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want ? or the rubbery we cannot ? ' kay . mm . mm . yeah . is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? what about a smell ? t to the remote ? yellow and grey . grapefruit . i would say , if i were to make a decision , i would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . um well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit - minded remote buyer . it ' s it ' s yellow . it ' s curved . it ' s sort of couple of couple of grey stripes . we could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . it would look like a banana just sitting on their table . rather than rather th maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . could be , it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . hey we could have a variety of options here . do you have more to your presentation ? oh . okay . i ' m gonna plug in here real quick . if i could . like i said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . um ow . ow . mm - hmm . okay . uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip - on - print , and the case . probably case um material . and probably a shape also . um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . and what kind of supplements we ' ll have . um energy source i think we ' ve , i think we ' ve decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . and we have five minutes . ' kay . so um i guess we should pick the case then . if we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um then the chip - on - print is still kind of , we could have either or . we could have a complex one or a a non - complex . but did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ? . okay . so we would , we would have the l_c_d_ screen ? ' kay . so i guess the case would be plastic , with perhaps that ' s not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . it ' s more of a su it ' s more of a supplement maybe . which will require a more expensive chip - on - print right ? ' kay . so i guess that , is that , is that about it ? so we have a good idea of what we ' re gonna need to to do on this ? um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . um here ' s what ' s gonna be going on . um um ryan you ' ll be working on the user interface design . um manuel you ' ll be working on the look - and - feel design . corrine we ' ll want a product evaluation . and the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh maybe and and get us a prototype . which should go along well with your look - and - feel design and your interface . so that basically just be working on the prototype , uh we ' ll accomplish your other two actions . alright . okay . let ' s do it .","the project manager reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting . the marketing expert discussed the results of trend watching reports which indicated a need for products which have a fancy look and feel , are technologically innovative , easy to use , include a fruit and vegetable theme , and are spongy in feel . the marketing expert stressed the need to incorporate these findings into the team ' s design and suggested that the team should create a remote that has limited buttons , can be personalized , and is not rectangular . the user interface designer briefly described how speech recognition technology works and what ways a user can use a remote . the user interface designer presented three existing products on the market - a voice recognition remote , an ipod , and a children ' s remote - and discussed a few features to include in the team ' s design . the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the restrictions involved in combining various components , energy sources , and materials . the industrial designer also discussed with the how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into their design . the team then discussed and decided what components , materials , and energy sources to use .",ES2016c
